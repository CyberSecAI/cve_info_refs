# Linux Terminal Server Project: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200805-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in components shipped with
LTSP which allow remote attackers to compromise terminal clients.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/ltsp** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.0** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

The Linux Terminal Server Project adds thin-client support to Linux
servers.

### Description

LTSP version 4.2, ships prebuilt copies of programs such as the Linux
Kernel, the X.org X11 server (GLSA 200705-06, GLSA 200710-16, GLSA
200801-09), libpng (GLSA 200705-24, GLSA 200711-08), Freetype (GLSA
200705-02, GLSA 200705-22) and OpenSSL (GLSA 200710-06, GLSA 200710-30)
which were subject to multiple security vulnerabilities since 2006.
Please note that the given list of vulnerabilities might not be
exhaustive.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly exploit vulnerabilities in the
aforementioned programs and execute arbitrary code, disclose sensitive
data or cause a Denial of Service within LTSP 4.2 clients.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

LTSP 4.2 is not maintained upstream in favor of version 5. Since
version 5 is not yet available in Gentoo, the package has been masked.
We recommend that users unmerge LTSP:

```
 # emerge --unmerge net-misc/ltsp
```

If you have a requirement for Linux Terminal Servers, please either set
up a terminal server by hand or use one of the distributions that
already migrated to LTSP 5. If you want to contribute to the
integration of LTSP 5 in Gentoo, or want to follow its development,
find details in bug 177580.

### Vendor Statement

This Vulnerability Note addresses a covert channel issue that represents one particular instance of a large class of side-channel attacks made possible by certain architectural features of modern CPUs. While it's possible to (probably) work around this one instance, the only fully effective solution that will work against current as well as future attacks of this kind is to not place sensitive data or data-dependent code flow in a position where side- channel attacks are possible. The cryptlib documentation contains guidance on doing this in the section "Safeguarding Cryptographic Operations".

### Vendor Statement

This Vulnerability Note addresses a covert channel issue that represents one particular instance of a large class of side-channel attacks made possible by certain architectural features of modern CPUs. While it's possible to (probably) work around this one instance, the only fully effective solution that will work against current as well as future attacks of this kind is to not place sensitive data or data-dependent code flow in a position where side- channel attacks are possible. The cryptlib documentation contains guidance on doing this in the section "Safeguarding Cryptographic Operations".

# OpenSSL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200710-06**

A buffer underflow vulnerability and an information disclosure
vulnerability have been discovered in OpenSSL.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.8e-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.8e-r3** |

### Background

OpenSSL is an implementation of the Secure Socket Layer and Transport
Layer Security protocols.

### Description

Moritz Jodeit reported an off-by-one error in the
SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers() function, resulting from an incomplete fix of
CVE-2006-3738. A flaw has also been reported in the
BN\_from\_montgomery() function in crypto/bn/bn\_mont.c when performing
Montgomery multiplication.

### Impact

A remote attacker sending a specially crafted packet to an application
relying on OpenSSL could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application. A local attacker could
perform a side channel attack to retrieve the RSA private keys.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8e-r3"
```

OpenSSL security update (RHSA-2007-0813)

Original Release Date: November 26, 2007

Last Revised: November 26, 2007

Number: ASA-2007-485

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

OpenSSL is an open source toolkit that implements the Secure Socket Layer
(SSL) versions 2 and 3 protocols, the Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1
protocol as well as a general use cryptography library.

A vulnerability has been discovered in the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers() function
which could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted list of ciphers causing
a buffer overrun. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2007-5135](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5135) to this issue.

Several side-channel attacks have been reported in SSL. A local attacker could
potentially exploit this vulnerability to obtain RSA private keys being used on
a system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2007-3108](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3108) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0813.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with OpenSSL installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Manager | CM 3.0 | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya EMMC | 1.017, 1.021 | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | 3.1 and earlier | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya AES | AES 3.1.4 and earlier | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable versions of
OpenSSL, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### 3. Problem description:

I Service Console package security updates

#####

a. OpenPegasus PAM Authentication Buffer Overflow
Alexander Sotirov from VMware Security Research discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the OpenPegasus Management server.

This flaw could be exploited by a malicious remote user on the service console network to gain root access to the service console.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2007-5360 to this issue.

RPM Updated: pegasus-2.5-552927
VM Shutdown: No
Host Reboot: No

Note: ESX Server 3.5 and ESX Server 3i are not affected by this issue.

[kb.vmware.com/kb/1003176](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1003176)

ESX Server 2.5.x
Users should remove the OpenPegasus CIM Management rpm. This component is disabled by default, and VMware recommends that you do not use this component of ESX Server 2.x. If you want to use the CIM functionality, upgrade to ESX Server 3.0.1 or a later release.

Note: This vulnerability can be exploited remotely only if the attacker has access to the service console network.

Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the service console be isolated from the VM network. Please see [www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726](http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726) for more information on VMware security best practices.

#####

b. Updated Samba package
An issue where attackers on the service console management network can cause a stack-based buffer overflow in the reply\_netbios\_packet function of nmbd in Samba. On systems where Samba is being used as a WINS server, exploiting this vulnerability can allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted WINS Name Registration requests followed by a WINS Name Query request.

An issue where attackers on the service console management network can exploit a vulnerability that occurs when Samba is configured as a Primary or Backup Domain controller. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via crafted GETDC mailslot requests, related to handling of GETDC logon server requests.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CVE-2007-5398 and CVE-2007-4572 to these issues.

Note: By default Samba is not configured as a WINS server or a domain controller and ESX is not vulnerable unless the administrator has changed the default configuration.

This vulnerability can be exploited remotely only if the attacker has access to the service console network.

Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the service console be isolated from the VM network. Please see [www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726](http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726) for more information on VMware security best practices.

c. Updated util-linux package
The patch addresses an issue where the mount and umount utilities in util-linux call the setuid and setgid functions in the wrong order and do not check the return values, which could allow attackers to gain elevated privileges via helper application such as mount.nfs.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2007-5191 to this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1571-1                  security@debian.org

Package        : openssl
Vulnerability  : predictable random number generator
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: yes
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-0166

Luciano Bello discovered that the random number generator in Debian's
openssl package is predictable.  This is caused by an incorrect
Debian-specific change to the openssl package (CVE-2008-0166).  As a
result, cryptographic key material may be guessable.

This is a Debian-specific vulnerability which does not affect other
operating systems which are not based on Debian.  However, other systems
can be indirectly affected if weak keys are imported into them.

It is strongly recommended that all cryptographic key material which has
been generated by OpenSSL versions starting with 0.9.8c-1 on Debian
systems is recreated from scratch.  Furthermore, all DSA keys ever used
on affected Debian systems for signing or authentication purposes should
be considered compromised; the Digital Signature Algorithm relies on a
secret random value used during signature generation.

The first vulnerable version, 0.9.8c-1, was uploaded to the unstable
distribution on 2006-09-17, and has since propagated to the testing and
current stable (etch) distributions.  The old stable distribution
(sarge) is not affected.

Affected keys include SSH keys, OpenVPN keys, DNSSEC keys, and key
material for use in X.509 certificates and session keys used in SSL/TLS
connections.  Keys generated with GnuPG or GNUTLS are not affected,
though.

A detector for known weak key material will be published at:

  <<http://security.debian.org/project/extra/dowkd/dowkd.pl.gz>>
  <<http://security.debian.org/project/extra/dowkd/dowkd.pl.gz.asc>>
    (OpenPGP signature)

Instructions how to implement key rollover for various packages will be
published at:

  <<http://www.debian.org/security/key-rollover/>>

This web site will be continously updated to reflect new and updated
instructions on key rollovers for packages using SSL certificates.
Popular packages not affected will also be listed.

In addition to this critical change, two other vulnerabilities have been
fixed in the openssl package which were originally scheduled for release
with the next etch point release: OpenSSL's DTLS (Datagram TLS,
basically "SSL over UDP") implementation did not actually implement the
DTLS specification, but a potentially much weaker protocol, and
contained a vulnerability permitting arbitrary code execution
(CVE-2007-4995).  A side channel attack in the integer multiplication
routines is also addressed (CVE-2007-3108).

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.8c-4etch3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution
(lenny), these problems have been fixed in version 0.9.8g-9.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl package and subsequently
regenerate any cryptographic material, as outlined above.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

RHSA-2007:0813 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2007-10-22
Updated:
2007-10-22
# RHSA-2007:0813 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: openssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Updated OpenSSL packages that correct security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and
Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.

A flaw was found in the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers() utility function. An
attacker could send a list of ciphers to an application that used this
function and overrun a buffer with a single byte (CVE-2007-5135). Few
applications make use of this vulnerable function and generally it is used
only when applications are compiled for debugging.

A number of possible side-channel attacks were discovered affecting
OpenSSL. A local attacker could possibly obtain RSA private keys being
used on a system. In practice these attacks would be difficult to perform
outside of a lab environment. This update contains backported patches
designed to mitigate these issues. (CVE-2007-3108).

Users of OpenSSL should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to resolve these issues.

Note: After installing this update, users are advised to either restart all
services that use OpenSSL or restart their system.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
