Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**1. Vulnerability Description**

The Trend Micro OfficeScan Corporate Edition 8.0 security patch (build 1042) addresses two potential security issues:

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A buffer overflow vulnerability could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web user.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** A vulnerability exists that allows bypassing the OfficeScan Management Console login password authentication by sending crafted HTTP headers.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the OfficeScan server CGI modules. This occurs when the software attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer size.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Improper handling of HTTP headers during login allows attackers to bypass the standard authentication mechanism.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **Buffer Overflow:**  This is a classic memory corruption vulnerability.
*   **Authentication Flaw:** The application is not properly validating or sanitizing HTTP headers, leading to an authentication bypass.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain full control over the system.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the OfficeScan Management Console, potentially enabling them to modify security settings, deploy malicious software, or gain access to network resources.

**5. Attack Vectors**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** This attack vector likely involves sending maliciously crafted input to the vulnerable CGI modules via HTTP requests.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** This involves sending specifically crafted HTTP headers in a login request to bypass the authentication mechanism.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker would need network access to the OfficeScan server and the ability to send HTTP requests to exploit the vulnerable CGI modules.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The attacker needs network access to send requests to the OfficeScan Management Console and the ability to craft specific HTTP headers.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided content is more detailed than a typical CVE description. It explicitly mentions that the issue lies within the CGI modules.
*   The update fixes the buffer overflow by replacing the old vulnerable modules with updated ones.
*   The authentication bypass issue is addressed by resetting the stored decrypted user logon information.
*   The patch includes `CGIOCommon.dll` and `cgiChkMasterPwd.exe` files, both version 8.0.0.1042.

**Summary of Findings**
The provided content is related to the CVE, detailing a buffer overflow and authentication bypass in Trend Micro OfficeScan server CGI modules. This allows an attacker to perform arbitrary code execution and bypass the login console, gaining access to the OfficeScan console.
