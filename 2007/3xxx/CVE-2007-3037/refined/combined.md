## Windows Media Player Code Execution Vulnerability Parsing Skins - CVE-2007-3037

A code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Media Player skin parsing. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-3037](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-3037).

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Media Player Code Execution Vulnerability Parsing Skins - CVE-2007-3037

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, which could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* When a user attempts to install a Windows Media Player skin file, the user is prompted with a "Windows Media Download" dialog box prior to the skin being applied.
* Attempts to exploit the vulnerability using WMZ and WMD files require the user to view or apply the skin after it is downloaded to be vulnerable.

#### Workarounds for Windows Media Player Code Execution Vulnerability Parsing Skins - CVE-2007-3037

**Disassociate the WMZ and WMD file extensions**

Disassociation of WMZ and WMD in Windows prevents previewing or opening WMZ and WMD files in Windows Media Player.

1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **"regeditâ** (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.
2. Expand **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT**, and click .**WMZ**, and then right click and select **Export**. Note: This will create a backup of this registry key in the âMy Documentsâ folder by default.
3. In the **Export Registry File** window, type âWMZ file association registry backup.regâ and press **Save**.

   This will create a backup of this registry key in the âMy Documentsâ folder by default.
4. Press the **Delete** key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. Select **Yes** to confirm the registry key deletion.
5. Repeat steps 2-5 for the **WMD**key.

**Impact of Workaround**: This workaround prevents users from applying skin files to Windows Media Player by double clicking on them. Users can still apply skin files that are in their default âskinsâ directory.

**Un-register Wmp.dll**

1. Un-registering the Wmp.dll registry key helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To modify the Wmp.dll registry key, follow these steps.
2. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **"regsvr32 -u %windir%\system32\wmp.dll"** (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
3. When a dialog box appears that confirms that the process has been successful, click **OK**.
4. Select the **File Types** tab.

**Impact of Workaround**: This workaround disables the Windows Media Player and applications that use the embedded Windows Media ActiveX Control.

#### FAQ for Windows Media Player Code Execution Vulnerability Parsing Skins - CVE-2007-3037

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Media Player parsing skins. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Windows Media Player incorrectly handles header information contained in skin files.

**What is a skin file?**

Skins are sets of scripts, art, media, and text files that can be combined to create a new appearance for Windows Media Player. Using skins, you can change not only the way Windows Media Player looks, but how it functions. Windows Media Player skin files are distributed in WMZ and WMD files.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the guest operating system are less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights on the guest operating system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially-crafted skin file designed to exploit this vulnerability through Windows Media Player and then convince a user to view the skins file. In no case, however, would an attacker have a way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted skin file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and opens the malicious skin file in Windows Media Player for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Windows Media Player is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

## Windows Media Player Code Execution Vulnerability Decompressing Skins - CVE-2007-3035

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Media Player an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-3035](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-3035).

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Media Player Code Execution Vulnerability Decompressing Skins - CVE-2007-3035

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, which could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* When a user attempts to install a Windows Media Player skin file, the user is prompted with a "Windows Media Download" dialog box prior to the skin being applied.
* Attempts to exploit the vulnerability using WMZ and WMD files require the user to view or apply the skin after it is downloaded to be vulnerable.

#### Workarounds for Windows Media Player Code Execution Vulnerability Decompressing Skins - CVE-2007-3035

**Disassociate the WMZ and WMD file extensions**

Disassociation of WMZ and WMD in Windows prevents previewing or opening WMZ and WMD files in Windows Media Player.

1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **"regeditâ** (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.
2. Expand **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT**, and click .**WMZ**, and then right click and select **Export**. Note: This will create a backup of this registry key in the âMy Documentsâ folder by default.
3. In the **Export Registry File** window, type âWMZ file association registry backup.regâ and press **Save**.

   This will create a backup of this registry key in the âMy Documentsâ folder by default.
4. Press the **Delete** key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. Select **Yes** to confirm the registry key deletion.
5. Repeat steps 2-5 for the **WMD** key.

**Impact of Workaround**: This workaround prevents users from applying skin files to Windows Media Player by double clicking on them. Users can still apply skin files that are in their default âskinsâ directory.

**Un-register Wmp.dll**

1. Un-registering the Wmp.dll registry key helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To modify the Wmp.dll registry key, follow these steps.
2. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **"regsvr32 -u %windir%\system32\wmp.dll"** (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
3. When a dialog box appears that confirms that the process has been successful, click **OK**.
4. Select the **File Types** tab.

**Impact of Workaround**: This workaround disables the Windows Media Player and applications that use the embedded Windows Media ActiveX Control.

#### FAQ for Windows Media Player Code Execution Vulnerability Decompressing Skins - CVE-2007-3035

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Media Player skin parsing. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Windows Media Player incorrectly handles header information contained in skin files.

**What is a skin file?**

Skins are sets of scripts, art, media, and text files that can be combined to create a new appearance for Windows Media Player. Using skins, you can change not only the way Windows Media Player looks, but how it functions. Windows Media Player skin files are distributed in WMZ and WMD files.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the guest operating system are less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights on the guest operating system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially-crafted skin file designed to exploit this vulnerability through Windows Media Player and then convince a user to view the skins file. In no case, however, would an attacker have a way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted skin file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and opens the malicious skin file in Windows Media Player for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Windows Media Player is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by changing Windows Media Player to correctly handle header information contained in skin files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

For more information on the support lifecycle policy, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/).

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Vista (all editions)
