- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization in Gforge, a collaborative development tool.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other unauthorized actions within the Gforge database.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation through crafted input that is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
