Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2007-3112:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation within the Cacti software. Specifically, the `graph_start` and `graph_end` parameters used for generating graphs are not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is caused by the ability to provide overly large values for the `graph_start` and `graph_end` parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by providing large values for the vulnerable parameters, which leads to excessive CPU consumption by the server processing the graph generation.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote, via HTTP requests, which are sent to the Cacti application, including malicious values in the graph parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Cacti application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The bug report indicates that Cacti versions 0.8.6i and 0.8.6j are affected, despite initial confusion about 0.8.6j being fixed.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in version 0.8.7 and was backported to version `0.8.6j-8.fc7`.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed, and a patch was available at [http://svn.cacti.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/branches/BRANCH_0_8_6/cacti/graph_image.php?rev=3956&r1=3898&r2=3956&makepatch=1&diff_format=h](http://svn.cacti.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/branches/BRANCH_0_8_6/cacti/graph_image.php?rev=3956&r1=3898&r2=3956&makepatch=1&diff_format=h).
*   This CVE is related to another similar vulnerability CVE-2007-3113, which involves the parameters `graph_height` and `graph_width`.
