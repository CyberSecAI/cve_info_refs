  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-3092",
      "root_cause": "Race condition in MSIE page updates.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "A race condition occurs when JavaScript code instructs MSIE6/7 to navigate away from a page with the same-domain origin policy to a third-party site. During this navigation, concurrently executed JavaScript has a window of opportunity to perform actions with the permissions of the old page, but with the content of the newly loaded page.",
        "This allows for actions such as cookie stealing/setting, arbitrary DOM manipulation, and reading or writing uninitialized DOM structures, leading to memory corruption and browser crashes."
      ],
      "impact": "Cookie stealing/setting, page hijacking, memory corruption, browser crashes.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered by JavaScript code that initiates a page navigation to a different site while simultaneously executing other JavaScript code."
      ],
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute Javascript code on a page to trigger the navigation. This is a client-side vulnerability. The target needs to use IE6 or IE7."
