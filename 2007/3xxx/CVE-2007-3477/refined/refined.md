{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `imagearc()` and `imagefilledarc()` functions in libgd allow an attacker to control the arc degree parameters.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The code does not properly validate the arc degree values.",
       "Insufficient parameter validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A denial of service attack can be performed due to excessive CPU consumption by providing overly large arc degree values.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By manipulating the parameters controlling the arc degree values for image drawing functions."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to control the parameters used in the `imagearc()` and `imagefilledarc()` functions."
    ]
