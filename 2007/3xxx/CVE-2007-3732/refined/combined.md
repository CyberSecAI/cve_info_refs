# CVE-2007-3732

| **Name** | CVE-2007-3732 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | In Linux 2.6 before 2.6.23, the TRACE\_IRQS\_ON function in iret\_exc calls a C function without ensuring that the segments are set properly. The kernel's %fs needs to be restored before the call in TRACE\_IRQS\_ON and before enabling interrupts, so that "current" references work. Without this, "current" used in the window between iret\_exc and the middle of error\_code where %fs is reset, would crash. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=248324#c0)  Marcel Holtmann    2007-07-16 04:54:23 UTC  ``` From Evan Teran:  <http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8765>  It is possible to cause the kernel to reference a null pointer with simple ptrace code. the OOPS seems to indicate that it occurs in arch_ptrace. I noticed  when working on my debugger, that if i set the childs CS to certain invalid values, instead of a segfault (i believe this is the correct response to invalid cs). Not only would the ptraced app crash, but so would the debugger. After further investigation, I realized that the debugger crash was the kernel terminating the ptracer due to a null pointer in one of the ptrace functions.

* [References](#references)

In Linux 2.6 before 2.6.23, the TRACE\_IRQS\_ON function in iret\_exc calls a
C function without ensuring that the segments are set properly. The
kernel's %fs needs to be restored before the call in TRACE\_IRQS\_ON and
before enabling interrupts, so that "current" references work. Without
this, "current" used in the window between iret\_exc and the middle of
error\_code where %fs is reset, would crash.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=248353#c0)  Marcel Holtmann    2007-07-16 12:03:17 UTC  ``` The iret_exc fixup path, run when iret generates an exception due to bogus %cs:%eip or %ss:%esp on the way back to user mode, has been broken since the %fs-percpu-current changes.  The kernel's %fs needs to be restored before the call in TRACE_IRQS_ON and before enabling interrupts, so that "current" references work.  Without this, "current" used in the window between iret_exc and the middle of error_code where %fs is reset, would crash (or get bogus values, perhaps exploitable in fancy ways).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=248353#c2)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-04-16 02:02:37 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=a10d9a71bafd3a283da240d2868e71346d2aef6f>  Commit a10d9a71 is the fix for [CVE-2007-3732](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-3732). When this patch was backported to the -stable kernel, it was wrongly listed as [CVE-2007-3731](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-3731). And when we were dealing with [CVE-2007-3731](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-3731), our developer backported this patch too even though we have filed a separate bug for [CVE-2007-3732](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-3732), so this was fixed. What a mess, but I'm glad we cleared this up afterall.  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=248324#c4](show_bug.cgi?id=248324#c4 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2007-3731 NULL pointer dereference triggered by ptrace") [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=248324#c7](show_bug.cgi?id=248324#c7 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2007-3731 NULL pointer dereference triggered by ptrace")   ``` |  |
