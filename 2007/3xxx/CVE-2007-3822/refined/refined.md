Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2007-3822: Session Riding and Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities in WebCit**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is a combination of inadequate input sanitization and lack of CSRF protection in the WebCit web interface.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Session Riding (CSRF):** The application lacks any protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This allows an attacker to execute actions on behalf of a logged-in victim without their knowledge.
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple areas within the application do not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it to other users, leading to stored XSS. These include:
        *   Calendar entries on mouseover.
        *   Bulletin board entry content.
        *   User preferences that allow escaping from the input field's value attribute.
        *   Room names when displayed on the room page.
        *   Uploaded file names when displayed.
    *   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application echoes the username provided via the `who` parameter in the `showuser` functionality without proper sanitization, leading to reflected XSS.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Session Riding:** An attacker can modify user details, preferences, and settings. They can also create new rooms, tasks, and responses in the victim's name, effectively taking over the victim's account.
    *   **Stored XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript that executes in the context of other users who view the affected content. This can lead to session hijacking, information theft, and further attacks against the victim.
    *   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker can craft malicious URLs and trick a logged-in user into visiting them, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser. The attacker could use this to perform actions on the victim's account, potentially similar to a CSRF attack.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Session Riding:** Attackers can host a malicious website that makes requests to WebCit on behalf of the victim when they visit the site.
    *   **Stored XSS:** An attacker can insert malicious JavaScript code into any of the vulnerable fields or functionalities. This malicious code will then execute on the browsers of users who view the compromised content.
    *  **Reflected XSS:** Attackers can send a malicious link to users containing JavaScript in the who parameter, leading to code execution when the user visits the link while logged into WebCit.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Session Riding:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting a web page under their control.
    *   **Stored XSS:**  The attacker needs to have the ability to enter content into one of the vulnerable fields.
    *   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to create and send a crafted URL to a victim who is logged in to WebCit.

*   **Additional Notes:**
    * The vulnerability report mentions that the vendor was contacted on 2007-06-24, and a fix was released in WebCit 7.11 on 2007-07-06.
    * The report recommends using nonces to prevent session riding and sanitizing user-provided input to prevent XSS. It also suggests requiring the old password when changing a user's password.
