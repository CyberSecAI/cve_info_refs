How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

SiteScape forum prior 7.3 Cross Site Scripting
scip AG Vulnerability ID 3159 (07/13/2007)
http://www.scip.ch/cgi-bin/smss/showadvf.pl?id=3159
I. INTRODUCTION
SiteScape forum is a commercial web forum. It uses presence to connect
teams through phone, IM, chat, SMS and email, as well as voice- and
web-conferencing. The application also supports online threaded
discussions and creation of content through blogs, wikis and
workflow-driven document and task management.
More information is available at the official web site at the following URL:
http://www.sitescape.com/
II. DESCRIPTION
Marc Ruef at scip AG found an input validation error within SiteScape
Forum prior release 7.3.
Some scripts that are not protected by any authentication procedure can
be used to run arbitrary script code within a cross site scripting attack.
Other parts of the application might be affected too.
III. EXPLOITATION
Classic script injection techniques and unexpected input data within a
browser session can be used to exploit this vulnerabilities.
The simple approach to verify an insecure installation is within the
login procedure. Use the following string as user name and a wrong
passwort for the simple proof-of-concept[1]:
<script>alert('scip');</script>
A plugin for our open-source exploiting framework "Attack Tool Kit"
(ATK) will be published in the near future. [2]
IV. IMPACT
Because non-authenticated parts of the software are affected, these
vulnerabilities are serious for every secure environment.
Non-authenticated users might be able to exploit this flaw to gain
elevated privileges (e.g. extracting sensitive cookie information or
launch a buffer overflow attack against another web browser).
Because other parts of the application might be affected too - this
could include some second order vulnerabilities - a severe attack
scenario might be possible.
V. DETECTION
Detection of web based attacks requires a specialized web proxy and/or
intrusion detection system. Patterns for such a detection are available
and easy to implement.
VI. SOLUTION
We have informed SiteScape on a very early stage. They told us that the
problem was not announced within a public advisory. But it is already
solved within the latest release of the discussed software. Therefore,
an upgrade to SiteScape Forum 7.3 or newer will solve the issues.
VII. VENDOR RESPONSE
SiteScape has been informed a first time at 06/29/2007 via email at
info-at-sitescape.com. A very kind reply by Chris Pressley came back
some minutes later. Further discussion of the flaw (how to reproduce)
and the co-ordination of a public advisory was made.
