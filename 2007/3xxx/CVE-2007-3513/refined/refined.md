  "CVE-2007-3513": {
    "Description": "A flaw was discovered in the usblcd driver. A local attacker could cause large amounts of kernel memory consumption, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Root cause": "The usblcd driver does not limit the size of write buffers.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient bounds checking",
      "Uncontrolled resource consumption"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker with write access can cause a denial of service by triggering excessive kernel memory consumption.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Local user with write access to the usblcd driver."
