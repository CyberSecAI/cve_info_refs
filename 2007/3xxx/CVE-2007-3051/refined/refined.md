{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2007-3051",
      "Root cause": "The application uses base64_decode on a cookie value without proper sanitization before using it in a SQL query.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Blind SQL Injection",
         "Improper Input Validation",
        "Use of base64_decode without sanitization"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can perform a blind SQL injection to extract sensitive data, such as user password hashes. The provided exploit specifically targets the admin's password hash.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the 'rv_user' cookie, which contains a base64 encoded payload that is then used in an SQL query.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and manipulate the 'rv_user' cookie. They must also know the username they want to target (e.g. 'admin') and the database table prefix used by the application."
