Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-3609:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `b.php` and `gallery.php` scripts within eMeeting Online Dating Software version 5.2 are vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input passed through the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: Specifically, the `id` parameter in the vulnerable scripts is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization.
- Lack of Input Validation: The software fails to validate and sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for malicious SQL queries to be injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Data Access: Attackers can use SQL injection to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database. This includes usernames, passwords, and potentially other information such as emails.
- Data Manipulation: Through SQL injection, attackers might be able to modify or delete data in the database.
- Potential for System Compromise: In some cases, successful SQL injection could lead to further exploitation, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the hosting system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Requests: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable scripts (`b.php` and `gallery.php`), manipulating the `id` parameter within the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote, Unauthenticated Access: The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. Login is not required to exploit the vulnerability in `b.php`, but it is required to exploit `gallery.php`.
- Knowledge of SQL Injection Techniques: The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL injection syntax and techniques to craft malicious payloads.

**Specific Exploits:**
The provided exploit-db content gives example exploits for `b.php` and `gallery.php`:
- `http://www.site.com/b.php?id=-1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,2,3,concat(username,0x3a,password),5,6,7,8,9,10/**/from/**/members/*`
- `http://www.site.com/b.php?id=-1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,2,3,concat(username,0x3a,password),5,6,7,8,9,10/**/from/**/members/**/where/**/username=0x61646D696E/*`
- `http://www.site.com/account/gallery.php?p=gal&id=-1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/null,null,null,concat(0x273e3c2f74643e,username,0x3a,password,0x3a,email,0x3c62723e3c2f2f),null,null/**/from/**/members/*`
These payloads use `UNION ALL SELECT` statements to extract data (usernames, passwords, and email) from the database.

**Additional Notes:**
- The administrator's username and password are not directly stored in the database.
- The `b.php` script returns only one row of data, while `gallery.php` can return multiple rows.
- Login is not required to exploit `b.php`, but is required to exploit `gallery.php`.
