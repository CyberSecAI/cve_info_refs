        "Lack of output encoding in several areas of the application."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the WebCit application, potentially leading to:\n\t- Session hijacking\n\t- Information disclosure\n\t- Unauthorized actions on behalf of victim users.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Stored XSS: Through calendar entries, bulletin board posts, user preferences, and room names",

This can be achieved by:\n\t- Direct interaction with the application (e.g., creating malicious calendar entries).\n\t- Utilizing Session Riding vulnerabilities to modify user data.\n\t- Crafting a URL containing malicious JavaScript in the 'who' parameter.",
       "additional_information": "The report also mentions session riding vulnerabilities, which while being a separate issue, could be used by an attacker to set malicious user preferences or perform other actions that could lead to XSS exploitation."
