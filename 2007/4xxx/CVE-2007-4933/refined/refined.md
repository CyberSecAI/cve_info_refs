Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-4933

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from two primary issues:
1.  **Admin Authorization Bypass:** The script does not properly terminate after redirecting unauthorized users to the login page, allowing access to admin functionalities by ignoring the "Location" header.
2.  **Arbitrary PHP Code Injection:** The `conf_appearence.php` script uses `fputs` to write user-provided data into the configuration file (`appearence.inc.php`) without proper sanitization or escaping of single quotes, backslashes and double quotes. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code by manipulating the POST parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Improper handling of unauthorized access attempts.
*   **Code Injection:** Insufficient input sanitization when writing to a configuration file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Command Execution:** By injecting malicious PHP code into `appearence.inc.php`, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server.
*   **Full Compromise:** An attacker can potentially gain complete control over the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Admin Bypass:** An attacker sends a request to the admin panel bypassing authorization checks, which redirects to the login page but doesn't terminate the script, allowing the attacker to continue with subsequent actions.
2.  **Code Injection:** An attacker sends a specially crafted POST request to `admin.php` with malicious PHP code embedded in parameters such as `productscount`, `colscount`, and other appearance settings. The injected code is written to `cfg/appearence.inc.php`
3.  **Command Execution:** After injecting the code, the attacker sends another GET request to `index.php` with the `cmd` parameter to execute a system command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited without any prior authentication or privileged access.

**Additional details:**
- The exploit provided in the content details the steps to exploit the vulnerability including sending HTTP requests to bypass authorization and inject malicious code.
- The exploit also includes a function to restore the config file with the original values.
- The exploit code is designed to work even if `magic_quotes_gpc` is enabled.
