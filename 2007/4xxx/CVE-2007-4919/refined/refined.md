```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The JBlog 1.0 application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the `index.php` and `admin/modifpost.php` scripts. The `id` parameter in the URL is directly used in SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can potentially read arbitrary data from the database, including usernames and passwords, and possibly modify or delete data. In this specific exploit, the attacker is able to extract the admin username and password.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is accessible remotely through HTTP GET requests to vulnerable scripts `index.php?id=` and `admin/modifpost.php?id=`.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable JBlog instance.
