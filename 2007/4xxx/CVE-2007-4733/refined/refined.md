{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Aztech DSL600EU router does not properly block port 80 even when the web interface is disabled in WAN to LAN or EXT to IN zones.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control",
      "IP and ARP spoofing vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can spoof their IP address, calculate the sequence number and connect to the web interface of the router.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote access",
       "Sending a SYN inundation to calculate sequence number"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send network packets to the router and perform IP spoofing techniques.",
        "additional_information": "The exploit requires a remote attacker to perform a SYN inundation and calculate the sequence number."
