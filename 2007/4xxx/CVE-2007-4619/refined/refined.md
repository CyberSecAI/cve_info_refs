{
  "CVE-2007-4619": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple integer overflows in Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) libFLAC before 1.2.1.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflows that lead to improper memory allocations, resulting in heap-based buffer overflows and stack based buffer overflows.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user opening a specially crafted FLAC file or cause a denial of service.",
      "Attack vectors": "User-assisted remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by enticing users to open a malformed FLAC file or network stream.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to create a malformed FLAC file and convince a user to open it in a vulnerable application."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple integer overflows in FLAC",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflows in flac could potentially be exploited by attackers via specially crafted files.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can execute code in the context of the user opening the file.",
      "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted FLAC files.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to create a specially crafted FLAC file and convince the user to open it."
    },
    {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "flac did not properly perform bounds checking in many situations.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper bounds checking which leads to heap buffer overflow",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can execute arbitrary code as the user or cause a denial of service in flac or applications that link against flac.",
      "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted FLAC audio file.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to craft a malicious FLAC file."
