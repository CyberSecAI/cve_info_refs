## Synopsis

Important: cups security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A1020)

## Topic

Updated CUPS packages that fix a security issue in the Internet Printing
Protocol (IPP) handling and correct some bugs are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer
for UNIX(R) operating systems.

A flaw was found in the way CUPS handles certain Internet Printing Protocol
(IPP) tags. A remote attacker who is able to connect to the IPP TCP port
could send a malicious request causing the CUPS daemon to crash, or
potentially execute arbitrary code. Please note that the default CUPS
configuration does not allow remote hosts to connect to the IPP TCP port.
(CVE-2007-4351)

Red Hat would like to thank Alin Rad Pop for reporting this issue.

All CUPS users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to resolve this issue.

In addition, the following bugs were fixed:

* the CUPS service has been changed to start after sshd, to avoid causing

delays when logging in when the system is booted.

* the logrotate settings have been adjusted so they do not cause CUPS to

reload its configuration. This is to avoid re-printing the current job,
which could occur when it was a long-running job.

* a bug has been fixed in the handling of the If-Modified-Since: HTTP

header.

* in the LSPP configuration, labels for labeled jobs did not line-wrap.

This has been fixed.

* an access check in the LSPP configuration has been made more secure.
* the cups-lpd service no longer ignores the "-odocument-format=..."

option.

* a memory allocation bug has been fixed in cupsd.
* support for UNIX domain sockets authentication without passwords has been

added.

* in the LSPP configuration, a problem that could lead to cupsd crashing

has been fixed.

* the error handling in the initscript has been improved.
* The job-originating-host-name attribute was not correctly set for jobs

submitted via the cups-lpd service. This has been fixed.

* a problem with parsing IPv6 addresses in the configuration file has been

fixed.

* a problem that could lead to cupsd crashing when it failed to open a

"file:" URI has been fixed.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Debian Security Advisory DSA 1407-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
November 18, 2007                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : cupsys
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-4351

Alin Rad Pop discovered that the Common UNIX Printing System is
vulnerable to an off-by-one buffer overflow in the code to process IPP
packets, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.7-4etch1. Updated packages for the arm architecure will be
provided later.

The cupsys version in the old stable distribution (sarge) is not
vulnerable to arbitrary code execution.

We recommend that you upgrade your cupsys packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch
- -------------------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CUPS: Memory corruption — GLSA **200711-16**

CUPS contains a boundary checking error that might lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-print/cups** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.12-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.12-r2** |

### Background

CUPS provides a portable printing layer for UNIX-based operating
systems.

### Description

Alin Rad Pop (Secunia Research) discovered an off-by-one error in the
ippReadIO() function when handling Internet Printing Protocol (IPP)
tags that might allow to overwrite one byte on the stack.

### Impact

A local attacker could send a specially crafted IPP request containing
"textWithLanguage" or "nameWithLanguage" tags, leading to a Denial of
Service or the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
"lp" user. If CUPS is configured to allow network printing, this
vulnerability might be remotely exploitable.

### Workaround

To avoid remote exploitation, network access to CUPS servers on port
631/udp should be restricted. In order to do this, update the "Listen"
setting in cupsd.conf to "*Listen localhost:631*" or add a rule to
the system's firewall. However, this will not avoid local users from
exploiting this vulnerability.

### Resolution

All CUPS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-print/cups-1.2.12-r2"
```

cups security update (RHSA-2007-1023)

Original Release Date: November 19, 2007

Last Revised: November 19, 2007

Number: ASA-2007-476

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer
for UNIX(R) operating systems.

A flaw was discovered in the handling of PDF files. An attacker
could create a malicious PDF file that would cause CUPS to crash or
potentially execute arbitrary code when printed. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2007-5393](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5393) to this issue.

A flaw was discovered in the way CUPS handles certain IPP tags.
A remote attacker who is able to connect to the IPP TCP port could send a
malicious request causing the CUPS daemon to crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2007-4351](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4351) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way CUPS handled SSL negotiation. A remote attacker
capable of connecting to the CUPS daemon could cause CUPS to crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2007-4045](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4045) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-1023.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with cups installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya AES | 3.1.3 | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable versions of
cups, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |

If you use CUPS, it is recommended to update to the latest package for your version of Slackware.  The latest cups package is available for Slackware -current, and patched packages are available for Slackware 8.1, 9.0, 9.1, 10.0, 10.1, 10.2, 11.0,  and 12.0 that fix the problems.  More details about this issue may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4351   Here are the details from the Slackware 12.0 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/cups-1.2.11-i486-2_slack12.0.tgz:   Patched cups-1.2.11.   An off-by-one error in ipp.c may allow a remote attacker to crash CUPS   resulting in a denial of service.

## CUPS buffer overflow vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#446897

Original Release Date: 2007-11-01 | Last Revised: 2007-12-18

---

### Overview

The Common Unix Printing System contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| The Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) is a printing service used by many Linux and Unix operating systems. CUPS uses a print scheduling process that dispatches print jobs and provides the printer's status to local and remote programs.  The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is a standard protocol that defines printing and managing print ques. As specified in RFC [2910](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2910), the IPP transport layer consists of an HTTP/1.1 request or response. Section [3.5](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2910#section-3.5) of RFC 2910 specifies two different types of tags that can either delimit sections of protocols (delimiter tags) or specify the type of each attribute value (value tags). textWithLanguage tags are defined in section [4.1.1.2](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2910#section-4.1.1.2) and nameWithLanguage is defined in section [4.1.2.2](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2910#section-4.1.2.2).Per Secunia Advisory [2007-76](http://secunia.com/secunia_research/2007-76/advisory/):*Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in CUPS, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "ippReadIO()" function in cups/ipp.c when processing IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) tags. This can be exploited to overwrite one byte on the stack with a zero by sending an IPP request containing specially crafted "textWithLanguage" or "nameWithLanguage" tags.Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the CUPS server or cause the server to crash. The cupsd daemon may run with root privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Administrators and users should see the systems affected portion of this document for a partial list of affected vendors. Users who compile CUPS from source should see CUPS Article [#508](http://www.cups.org/articles.php?L508): Common UNIX Printing System 1.3.4 for information about obtaining fixed software. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**Restricting access to CUPS servers by using the CUPS configuration [directives](http://www.cups.org/documentation.php/man-cupsd.conf.html), firewall rules, or access control lists may mitigate this vulnerability. By default, cupsd listens on port 631/udp. Systems that use CUPS exclusively for local printing should set the Listen directive to localhost:631 in the cupsd configuration file to prevent remote systems from exploiting this vulnerability. |
