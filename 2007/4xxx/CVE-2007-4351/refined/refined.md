{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow exists in the `ippReadIO()` function in `cups/ipp.c` due to a boundary error when handling Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) tags. Specifically, a specially crafted `textWithLanguage` or `nameWithLanguage` tag can cause an off-by-one write on the stack.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Off-by-one error"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker who can connect to the IPP TCP port could send a malicious request, causing the CUPS daemon to crash (Denial of Service), or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the CUPS server (which could be root). Local users could also trigger this vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network - sending a malicious IPP request containing specially crafted textWithLanguage or nameWithLanguage tags to the IPP TCP port (default 631/udp)",
      "Local - a local user can send crafted IPP requests."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the IPP TCP port of a vulnerable CUPS server or have local access to send crafted IPP requests.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is an off-by-one error, where a single byte on the stack can be overwritten with zero."
