Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input passed through the `set_lang` parameter in a browser cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The application directly returns the unsanitized value of the `set_lang` cookie to the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or script code into a user's browser session when they visit the affected site.
- This can lead to various impacts like session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, or defacement.
- The provided text states the impact is partial in terms of integrity, and there is no impact to availability or confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is **remote** and involves manipulating the `set_lang` parameter in a browser cookie, which is sent to the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to set or modify the `set_lang` cookie in the user's browser. This can be achieved through various methods, such as:
  -  Convincing a user to visit a specially crafted URL, including a malicious cookie.
  -  Exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow cookie manipulation.
- The attacker doesn't need authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in eXV2.de CMS versions <= 2.0.5.
- The suggested fix involves sanitizing the `set_lang` cookie value before using it, ensuring that it only accepts specific, pre-defined values.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Vision aka n-tier and reported on 2007-08-07.
