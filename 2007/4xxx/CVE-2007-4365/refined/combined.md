1. Cross Site Scripting:
Input passed directly to the "set\_lang" parameter in the Browser Cookie is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
A user can sent a cookie to himself with ?/set\_lang=deutsch and edit it.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
Workaround: [Cross Site Scripting]
=============
Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.
Example:
$my\_Cookie\_Vars = $\_COOKIE;
if (isset($my\_Cookie\_Vars['set\_lang'])){
if (($my\_Cookie\_Vars['set\_lang'] == "deutsch")||($my\_Cookie\_Vars['set\_lang'] == "english")||($my\_Cookie\_Vars['set\_lang'] == "french")) {
} else {
$abuse = true;
$xoopsConfig['language'] = $xoopsConfig['default\_language'];
}
}
if ($abuse){
die("The desired action could not be performed.");
}
