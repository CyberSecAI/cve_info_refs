Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4646:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the POP3 service of Hexamail Server version 3.0.0.001.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is triggered due to insufficient bounds checking when handling a long string within a `USER` command sent to the POP3 service.
- The overflow allows control of the `EAX` and `ECX` registers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided exploit code demonstrates that sending a specially crafted `USER` command causes the Hexamail server to crash.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can potentially gain control of `EAX` and `ECX` registers. The exploit author suggests the possibility of arbitrary code execution, although they mention that it would be "tricky".

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malformed `USER` command to the POP3 service over the network (port 110).
- The service needs to be accessible on the network for the vulnerability to be exploited remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Hexamail Server on port 110.
- **Knowledge of POP3 Protocol:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a valid `USER` command with the malicious payload to trigger the overflow.
