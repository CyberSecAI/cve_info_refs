Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4790:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a memory corruption issue in the `FPOLE.OCX` ActiveX control within Microsoft Visual FoxPro 6.0. The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted input is passed to a method within the control.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stack overflow:** The exploit-db content specifically mentions a "Remote Stack Overflow". The provided VBScript code shows that a large string (300,000 'b' characters) is being passed to the `FoxDoCmd` method which causes the stack overflow.
*   **Memory corruption:** The Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-010 refers to "ActiveX Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability". This confirms a memory corruption issue, specifically within the ActiveX object.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the same privileges as the logged-in user.
*   **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system. This can lead to installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new user accounts with full user rights.
*   **Denial of Service:** Although the provided exploit focuses on code execution, denial of service is also a potential impact, especially considering the stack overflow.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Web-based attacks:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker hosting a specially crafted webpage. When a user visits this page using Internet Explorer, the vulnerable ActiveX control is triggered leading to the vulnerability exploitation.
*   **Compromised websites:** Websites that host user-provided content or advertisements could also be used to deliver malicious content to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers could convince users to click malicious links via email or instant messages that lead them to an attacker-controlled website hosting the exploit.
*   **Banner Ads:** Attackers can display specially crafted web content through banner advertisements.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to host a webpage:** An attacker needs to host a webpage or control a website to deliver the exploit.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince users to visit the malicious webpage (unless using methods like malvertising).
*   **No user interaction if control is already allowed:**  If the ActiveX control has already been allowed by the user through the ActiveX opt-in feature, then the exploit can be triggered without explicit user interaction besides visiting the page.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `FPOLE.OCX` ActiveX control.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by providing a large amount of data to the `FoxDoCmd` function of the ActiveX control.
*   The provided exploit uses VBScript to trigger the overflow.
*   The Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-010 addresses this vulnerability along with three other vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and provides a patch by setting the kill-bit for the vulnerable ActiveX control
*   The ActiveX control was not in the default allow-list for ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer 7.
*   The vulnerability has been publicly disclosed and is known as the "Microsoft Visual FoxPro FPOLE.OCX ActiveX control buffer overflow".
