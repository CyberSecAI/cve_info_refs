  "CVE-2007-4272": {
    "Root cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in IBM DB2 UDB allow local users to create arbitrary files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure handling of umask settings allowing file creation with attacker's umask.",
      "Ability to create files at /etc/ld.so.preload.",
      "Ability to create files at certain cron data file locations.",
      "Abuse of OSSEMEMDBG or TRC_LOG_FILE environment variables in db2licd (db2licm)."
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users can create arbitrary files.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Unspecified vectors that honor attacker's umask.",
      "Creation of /etc/ld.so.preload file.",
      "Creation of files in cron data file locations.",
      "Use of OSSEMEMDBG environment variable in db2licd (db2licm).",
      "Use of TRC_LOG_FILE environment variable in db2licd (db2licm)."
      
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user access to the system."
