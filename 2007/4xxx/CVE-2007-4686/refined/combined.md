How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hash: SHA1
Advisory: Mac OS X TIOCSETD IOCTL Kernel
Memory Corruption Vulnerability
Advisory ID: TKADV2007-001
Revision: 1.0
Release Date: 2007/11/15
Last Modified: 2007/11/15
Date Reported: 2007/03/19
Author: Tobias Klein (tk at trapkit.de)
Affected Software: Mac OS X xnu kernel <= version
8.10.1 (xnu-792.22.5~1)
Mac OS X v10.4 through v10.4.10,
Mac OS X Server v10.4 through v10.4.10
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
Vendor URL: http://www.apple.com
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version
CVE-ID: CVE-2007-4686
Patch development time: 241 days
======================
Vulnerability details:
======================
The xnu kernel of Mac OS X contains a vulnerability in the code that
handles TIOCSETD ioctl requests. Exploitation of this vulnerability
can result in:
1) local execution of arbitrary code at the kernel level (complete system
compromise), or
2) local denial of service attacks (system crash due to a kernel panic)
The issue can be triggered by sending a specially crafted ioctl request.

In line 1090 the user supplied "data" of the type caddr\_t (char \*) gets
stored in the variable "t" of the type signed int (see (1)). Then in line
1093 the value of "t" is compared with "nlinesw". As "data" is supplied
by the user it is possible to provide a string value >= 0x80000000. If so,
"t" gets a negative value due to the type conversion error (see (1)) and
the check in line 1093 will always be passed (see (2)). In line 1098 the user
supplied value "t" is used to reference and call "l\_open". This leads to full
control of the kernel execution flow.
