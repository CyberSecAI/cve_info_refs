{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Type conversion error and missing bounds check in the handling of TIOCSETD ioctl requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The user-supplied data is not properly validated before being used as an index into the `linesw` array, leading to an out-of-bounds read or write.",
      "Type confusion vulnerability by passing a large value that converts to a negative integer due to the use of a signed int for comparison."
    ],
    "impact": "Local execution of arbitrary code at the kernel level (complete system compromise) or local denial of service (system crash due to kernel panic).",
    "attack_vectors": "Local exploitation by sending a specially crafted TIOCSETD ioctl request.",
     "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to have the ability to send ioctl requests to a vulnerable device."
  },
    "affected_software": "Mac OS X xnu kernel <= version 8.10.1 (xnu-792.22.5~1), Mac OS X v10.4 through v10.4.10, Mac OS X Server v10.4 through v10.4.10",
  "more_details": "The vulnerability occurs in the `ttioctl` function in `bsd/kern/tty.c`. The user-supplied data is converted to a signed integer, which can be manipulated to bypass a bounds check, allowing the attacker to control the kernel execution flow through the function pointer array `linesw`. The vulnerability is triggered when handling a TIOCSETD ioctl request. This can lead to full control of the kernel execution flow and allows the execution of arbitrary code with kernel privileges."
