{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "eyeOS uses intermediate checksums in plaintext without proper validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure generation of checksums",
       "Lack of validation of checksums"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit allows an attacker to predict checksums, leading to local Denial of Service, user password theft, mass user registration, brute-force attacks, and flooding of eyeBoard service.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Predicting the checksum based on observed patterns",
      "Replaying requests with valid predicted checksums"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to observe the checksum generation process and automate its prediction. No authentication is needed for the exploitation."
