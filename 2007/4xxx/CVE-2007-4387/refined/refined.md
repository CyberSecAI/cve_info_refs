Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4387:

**Content Analysis**

The provided content from securityreason.com clearly references CVE-2007-4387 alongside other CVEs related to 2wire routers. It details a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability and provides exploit examples.

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The 2wire routers lack proper validation of HTTP requests. Specifically, they do not validate the HTTP POST method, the Referer header, or any other mechanism that would prevent CSRF attacks.
*   **Weakness:** The core vulnerability is the absence of CSRF protection in the router's web interface. This allows an attacker to forge requests that are then executed by the router as if they came from an authenticated user.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to change a wide array of router settings including:
    *   Setting/Changing the router's password.
    *   Modifying DNS settings.
    *   Disabling wireless authentication.
    *   Setting Dynamic DNS.
    *   Disabling the firewall.
    *   Resetting the device.
    *   Potentially other configuration changes.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack is carried out by tricking a user (who is logged into the router's web interface) into visiting a malicious website or opening an email that contains a crafted link or form. The malicious page then forces the user's browser to send unauthorized requests to the router.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker requires no prior authentication or direct access to the router itself, beyond knowing its IP address (likely a default local IP such as 192.168.1.254) and the structure of the router's HTTP request parameters. The attack needs a logged in user to visit a malicious website or open a malicous email.

**Technical Details**

The provided exploit examples illustrate how configuration changes can be achieved via a simple GET request:

*   Setting a password: `http://192.168.1.254/xslt?PAGE=A05_POST&THISPAGE=A05&NEXTPAGE=A05_POST&ENABLE_PASS=on&PASSWORD=NUEVOPASS&PASSWORD_CONF=NUEVOPASS`
*   Adding names to the DNS: `http://192.168.1.254/xslt?PAGE=J38_SET&THISPAGE=J38&NEXTPAGE=J38_SET&NAME=www.prueba.hkm&ADDR=216.163.137.3`
*   Disabling Wireless Authentication: `http://192.168.1.254/xslt?PAGE=C05_POST&THISPAGE=C05&NEXTPAGE=C05_POST&NAME=encrypt_enabled&VALUE=0`
*   Setting Dynamic DNS: `http://192.168.1.254/xslt?PAGE=J05_POST&THISPAGE=J05&NEXTPAGE=J05_POST&IP_DYNAMIC=TRUE`

**Affected Products/Versions**

*   2wire 1701HG
*   2wire 2071 Gateway
*   Software versions: v3.17.5, 5.29.51 (when default password is not set)

**Additional Notes**

*   The securityreason.com content provides significantly more detail than the typical CVE description, and includes concrete exploit examples.
*   The fact that these routers often ship with a default, blank password exacerbates the vulnerability.
*   The provided demo link, `http://www.hakim.ws/2wire/demodns.html`, further demonstrates the impact of DNS poisoning, although it is no longer accessible.

**Summary of extracted information:**

*   **Root cause:** Lack of CSRF protection (missing POST/Referer validation).
*   **Weaknesses:** Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability, default password issues.
*   **Impact:** Configuration changes (password, DNS, firewall, wireless settings, device reset, etc.).
*  **Attack vector:**  Malicious web page or email link, that exploits CSRF vulnerability when user is logged into the router web interface.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires knowledge of the router's IP and web interface structure; user must be logged into the router's web interface, and visit the malicious page/email.
