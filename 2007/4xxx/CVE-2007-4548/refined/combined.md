The command line deployer tool allowed deployment, both local and remote, without specifying user and password. The source of this problem has been identified and the fix is currently being tested, refer to [JIRA-3404](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GERONIMO-3404) for further details.  Apache Geronimo v2.0 was just in the process of being released however, given the sensitivity of this bug, the release has been brought to a halt. We are currently discussing on the mailing list alternatives to continue with the release process. Here is the link to the thread holding this discussion [Geronimo 2.0 Release suspended due to security issue found before release](http://www.nabble.com/Geronimo-2.0-Release-suspended-due-to-security-issue-found-before-release-tf4263667s134.html) |

The newly released Apache Geronimo 2.0.1 breaks new ground as the first open source Application Server to provide two certified JAX-WS Web Services implementations: Apache Axis2 and Apache CXF. This capability further highlights the flexibility of Apache Geronimo which also provides two certified web container implementations: Apache Tomcat and Jetty.  Geronimo 2.0.1 also introduces new features such as simplified development, improved diagnostics and flexible assemblies. Simplified deployment is achieved through the use of standards based programming model enhancements found in Java Enterprise Edition 5.0. This includes support for the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB3) specification as implemented by the Apache OpenEJB and Apache OpenJPA projects. Here is a list of some of these programming enhancements:   * Streamlined development options provided with Java Enterprise Edition 5.0 * EJB 3.0 persistence (Java Persistence Architecture) * A programming model that uses annotations to express developer defaults in the source code   Improved diagnostic capabilities include enhanced logging, class loader viewer as well as JMX browser which are all available from the web based console. Change logging levels on the fly as well as view existing logs with a set of filters. Looking for a class and wondering where it came from? The class loader viewer let's you find them. Want to see or change the attributes for MBeans in the server? The JMX browser allows you to navigate the MBeans in the server in a simple tree format without having to hook up external consoles or third party products. In addition, the Certification Authority portlet provides a user friendly interface to setup a Certification Authority, your own Public-Key Infrastructure, and use server/client Digital Certificates for securing your applications.  Flexible assemblies are realized through the project's continued promotion of the "Little G" 2.0.1 —a lightweight container offering for projects that don't need the full feature set of Java Enterprise Edition 5.0. Perfect for web-service and SOA deployments, "Little G" brings the modularity, manageability and extensibility of Apache Geronimo to a lightweight assembly that is small in footprint but full of capability.  This flexible, user-friendly, and easy-to-configure application server is built from best-of-breed open source components and is fully licensed under the Apache Software License, offering multiple benefits to organizations and their development teams. They can use Apache Geronimo as-is or, if they so choose, create their own custom offerings without the restrictions imposed by other open source licenses. Flexibility and choice, you have both with Apache Geronimo.  Visit the [Downloads](../../../downloads.html) page for details on downloading Apache Geronimo v2.0.1 |

#### Description

According to the JAAS LoginModule contract, if a login fails, the LoginModule should throw an exception from the login() method (typically FailedLoginException). We instead return false, which does not mean "login failed", but instead means "this login module is not appropriate" (the stated example for returning false is a root login for an NIS login module).

#### Description

I was just testing the geronimo-tomcat6-jee5-2.0-bin.zip on a new WinXP machine and discovered that anyone can administer a Geronimo server (local or remotely) if they enter a null Username when prompted by the deploy or geronimo scripts. I verified that the <user\_home>\.geronimo-deployer file did not exist on the WinXP machine and on a Linux box I used to verify the remote scenario....
