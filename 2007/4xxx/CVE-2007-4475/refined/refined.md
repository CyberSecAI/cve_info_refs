**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `SaveViewToSessionFile()` method does not properly validate the size of input data, leading to a buffer overflow when handling specially crafted data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the user viewing the malicious content.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attack could also cause the web browser to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Web-based Attack:** The attack is triggered by convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document, such as a web page, an HTML email, or an HTML attachment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted HTML document containing malicious data that will trigger the buffer overflow when processed by the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious HTML document to the victim, either through a website, email, or other means.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable `EAI WebViewer3D` ActiveX control is provided by `webviewer3d.dll`.
