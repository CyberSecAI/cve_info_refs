    "description": "The provided content from dovecot.org details multiple fixes included in the release of Dovecot v1.0.3. Among them, there's a security-related fix in the ACL plugin.",
    "root_cause": "The ACL plugin in Dovecot v1.0.2 did not properly enforce access control restrictions when handling flags in COPY and APPEND commands. Specifically, a user with 'insert' rights for a mailbox could still save seen, deleted, and other flags even if they did not have specific 'seen, deleted, other flags' rights.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect access control enforcement in the ACL plugin."
    ],
    "impact": "A user with insert permission on a mailbox, but not other permissions, could set or modify flags they should not have had the rights to set.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker with the 'i' (insert) right but without 's/t/w' rights for a given mailbox could potentially modify flags in a way not intended by the permissions system."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must have a valid user account with 'i' (insert) right but without 's/t/w' rights to a mailbox.",
     "additional_information": "The release notes state this is technically a security fix but its unlikely this caused problems for anyone. Another bug, also related to the ACL plugin is that the 'i' (insert) right did not work unless the user also had the 'l' (lookup) right. This was fixed in the same release."
