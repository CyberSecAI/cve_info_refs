The provided content is related to the identified CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The `employee.php` file in PHPortal includes the file `db_form_o_model.php` using the `$DOCUMENT_ROOT` variable. If `$DOCUMENT_ROOT` can be manipulated (or if it can be made to resolve to a remote location), an attacker can inject remote files for execution, resulting in arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the server hosting PHPortal.

**Attack vectors:**
- By manipulating the `$DOCUMENT_ROOT` variable or making it resolve to a remote URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to manipulate `$DOCUMENT_ROOT` or influence its value.
- Network access to the vulnerable server.
