      "cve": "CVE-2007-4411",
      "root_cause": "The IP address of an authenticated user with +x mode set is not properly hidden, and can be revealed through a trick using /silence and CTCP pings.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper hiding of user's IP address",

        "Use of /silence command to probe a user's IP address using CIDR masks or by sending targeted CTCP pings.",

      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send /silence commands to the target user and monitor the CTCP ping responses.",
       "details": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to discover the IP address of an authenticated user with the +x mode set by using the /silence command. The attacker sends CTCP pings to the target user and determines if there's a response. By systematically using CIDR masks or targeted silences based on TLD and ISP-wide ranges, the attacker can deduce the user's IP address with a maximum of 32 pings or by other targeted methods. The IP should have been kept hidden with +x mode."
