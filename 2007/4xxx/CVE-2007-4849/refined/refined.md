Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-4849:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in the JFFS2 filesystem when handling POSIX ACLs (Access Control Lists). Specifically, when an inode (data structure representing a file or directory) was created or its ACL was set, the legacy mode bits (which represent basic file permissions) were not being written correctly to the storage medium.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Permission Storage:** The core issue is the JFFS2 filesystem failing to persist the correct legacy mode bits for inodes created with POSIX ACL support enabled. When an inode with ACLs is created, the legacy mode bits are not correctly saved.
- **Inconsistent Permissions:**  As a result of the above, when the JFFS2 filesystem is unmounted and then remounted, the permissions for files and directories that were created with ACLs become incorrect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** Due to the incorrect permissions on remount, local users could potentially gain access to files or directories that they should not have access to, potentially leading to unauthorized data access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** This is primarily a local vulnerability. An attacker needs to have local access to the system to potentially exploit this vulnerability.
- **File System Remount:** The vulnerability is triggered when the JFFS2 filesystem is unmounted and then remounted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
- **JFFS2 filesystem with ACL support:** The target system must be using the JFFS2 filesystem with POSIX ACL support enabled.
- **Ability to create files with ACLs:** The attacker would need to be able to create files and directories and set ACLs on them.
- **File System Remount:** The attacker would need the ability to trigger a remount of the file system (or just wait for it to occur naturally).

**Technical Details:**
- The patch addresses the issue by ensuring that the legacy mode bits are written correctly during inode creation and ACL setting.
-  The `jffs2_do_setattr` function is updated to correctly apply the mode changes.
- `jffs2_init_acl` is modified to correctly initialize ACLs and legacy modes
- The patch also includes modifications to the `jffs2_create`, `jffs2_symlink`, `jffs2_mkdir`, `jffs2_mknod` functions in `dir.c` to handle ACLs properly.
- A new `acl` parameter is passed to `jffs2_new_inode`

This vulnerability allows a local user to potentially bypass file system permission restrictions after a remount, due to the improper storage of permissions.
