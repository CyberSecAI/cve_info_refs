      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The Entertainment CMS is vulnerable to local file inclusion due to the `pagename` parameter in `custom.php` not being properly sanitized.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
          "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server, leading to remote command execution.",
         "attack_vector": "By manipulating the 'pagename' parameter in the 'custom.php' script, an attacker can include a file, such as web server log files, that may contain malicious PHP code.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge of locations of files that may contain injected code (e.g. web server logs). The `magic_quotes_gpc` setting needs to be off for this to work.",
        "additional_info": "The exploit also details how to inject malicious PHP code into the web server's log files, then include those logs using the LFI vulnerability, and execute the injected code. The provided exploit code has a list of common log file locations. The exploit also shows how to pass commands to the system function via a cookie named 'cmd'."
