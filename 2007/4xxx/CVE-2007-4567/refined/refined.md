{
  "CVE-2007-4567": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Linux kernel did not properly validate the hop-by-hop IPv6 extended header.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper validation of the skb->dst data structure in the ipv6_hop_jumbo() function, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers could send a crafted IPv6 packet and cause a denial of service via kernel panic.",
       "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted IPv6 packet.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker with the ability to send network packets."
    },
      {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The  `ip6_dst_idev()` function does not handle a NULL `skb->dst` argument.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "NULL pointer dereference when accessing `skb->dst`.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Kernel panic, leading to a denial of service.",
      "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted IPv6 packet that results in a NULL `skb->dst`.",
