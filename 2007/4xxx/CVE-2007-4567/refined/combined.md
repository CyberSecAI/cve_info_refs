| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=550907#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-12-28 03:30:42 UTC  ``` Description of problem: This was disclosed at 26c3.  Fabian also mentioned the fix for [CVE-2009-1389](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1389) regarding the r8169 driver introduces a similar security problem as this: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/fdd7b4c3302c93f6833e338903ea77245eb510b4>  - RTL_W16(RxMaxSize, 16383); + RTL_W16(RxMaxSize, rx_buf_sz);  is actually a revert of this: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/126fa4b9ca5d9d7cb7d46f779ad3bd3631ca387c>  - /* For gigabit rtl8169, MTU + header + CRC + VLAN */ - RTL_W16(RxMaxSize, tp->rx_buf_sz); + /* Low hurts. Let's disable the filtering. */ + RTL_W16(RxMaxSize, 16383);  The accompanying comment for the original commit (126fa):  The size of the incoming frame is not correctly checked.  The RxMaxSize register (0xDA) does not work as expected and incoming frames whose size exceeds the MTU actually end spanning multiple descriptors. The first Rx descriptor contains the size of the whole frame (or some garbage in its place). The driver does not expect something above the space allocated to the current skb and crashes loudly when it issues a skb_put.  The fix contains two parts: - disable hardware Rx size filtering: so far it only proved to be able to trigger some new fancy errors; [...]  warned of issues when using hardware Rx size filtering and Fabian claimed to be able to trigger something similar to the e1000 bug when using a specific packet size.

RHSA-2010:0095 - Security Advisory

# RHSA-2010:0095 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor package that fixes security issues and several
bugs is now available.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
(RHEV) Hypervisor ISO disk image. The RHEV Hypervisor is a dedicated
Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything
necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: RHEV Hypervisor is only available for the Intel 64 and AMD64
architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the IPv6 Extension Header (EH) handling
implementation in the Linux kernel. The skb->dst data structure was not
properly validated in the ipv6\_hop\_jumbo() function. This could possibly
lead to a remote denial of service. (CVE-2007-4567)

The Parallels Virtuozzo Containers team reported two flaws in the routing
implementation. If an attacker was able to cause a large enough number of
collisions in the routing hash table (via specially-crafted packets) for
the emergency route flush to trigger, a deadlock could occur. Secondly, if
the kernel routing cache was disabled, an uninitialized pointer would be
left behind after a route lookup, leading to a kernel panic.
(CVE-2009-4272)

A flaw was found in each of the following Intel PRO/1000 Linux drivers in
the Linux kernel: e1000 and e1000e. A remote attacker using packets larger
than the MTU could bypass the existing fragment check, resulting in
partial, invalid frames being passed to the network stack. These flaws
could also possibly be used to trigger a remote denial of service.
(CVE-2009-4536, CVE-2009-4538)

A flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel.
Receiving overly-long frames with a certain revision of the network cards
supported by this driver could possibly result in a remote denial of
service. (CVE-2009-4537)

The x86 emulator implementation was missing a check for the Current
Privilege Level (CPL) and I/O Privilege Level (IOPL). A user in a guest
could leverage these flaws to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or
possibly escalate their privileges within that guest. (CVE-2010-0298,
CVE-2010-0306)

A flaw was found in the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) emulation. Access
to the internal data structure pit\_state, which represents the data state
of the emulated PIT, was not properly validated in the pit\_ioport\_read()
function. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2010-0309)

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for RHEV
Hypervisor. These fixes are for kernel issues CVE-2006-6304, CVE-2009-2910,
CVE-2009-3080, CVE-2009-3556, CVE-2009-3889, CVE-2009-3939, CVE-2009-4020,
CVE-2009-4021, CVE-2009-4138, and CVE-2009-4141; ntp issue CVE-2009-3563;
dbus issue CVE-2009-1189; dnsmasq issues CVE-2009-2957 and CVE-2009-2958;
gnutls issue CVE-2009-2730; krb5 issue CVE-2009-4212; bind issue
CVE-2010-0097; gzip issue CVE-2010-0001; openssl issues CVE-2009-2409 and
CVE-2009-4355; and gcc issue CVE-2009-3736.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* on systems with a large number of disk devices, USB storage devices may

get enumerated after "/dev/sdz", for example, "/dev/sdcd". This was not
handled by the udev rules, resulting in a missing "/dev/live" symbolic
link, causing installations from USB media to fail. With this update, udev
rules correctly handle USB storage devices on systems with a large number
of disk devices, which resolves this issue. (BZ#555083)

As RHEV Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug fixes from the KVM update
RHSA-2010:0088 have been included in this update:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0088.html>

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=548641#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-12-18 01:25:29 UTC  ``` Originally discovered by Victor Julien that there is a way to crash the Linux kernel by sending a single IPv6 packet at it.  1) The [CVE-2007-4567](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-4567) issue was reported to Red Hat in September 2007. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 was found not to be affected.  2) On December 18, 2009, a customer reported to us that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 was vulnerable to [CVE-2007-4567](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-4567).  3) Investigations showed that the issue was introduced in the RHBA-2008-0314 update on May 21, 2008 via a backport of a collection of patches for DoD IPv6 conformance.  4) Updates released on January 7, 2010 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, resolving [CVE-2007-4567](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-4567).  Note that the Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG are not affected.

## Details

The minix filesystem did not properly validate certain filesystem

values. If a local attacker could trick the system into attempting

to mount a corrupted minix filesystem, the kernel could be made to

hang for long periods of time, resulting in a denial of service.

This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2006-6058](/security/CVE-2006-6058))

The signal handling on PowerPC systems using HTX allowed local users

to cause a denial of service via floating point corruption. This was

only vulnerable in Ubuntu 6.10 and 7.04. ([CVE-2007-3107](/security/CVE-2007-3107))

The Linux kernel did not properly validate the hop-by-hop IPv6

extended header. Remote attackers could send a crafted IPv6 packet

and cause a denial of service via kernel panic. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04. ([CVE-2007-4567](/security/CVE-2007-4567))

The JFFS2 filesystem with ACL support enabled did not properly store

permissions during inode creation and ACL setting. Local users could

possibly access restricted files after a remount. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-4849](/security/CVE-2007-4849))

Chris Evans discovered an issue with certain drivers that use the

ieee80211\_rx function. Remote attackers could send a crafted 802.11

frame and cause a denial of service via crash. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-4997](/security/CVE-2007-4997))

Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam

devices. A local user with physical access to the system could remove

the device while a userspace application had it open and cause the USB

subsystem to block. This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04.

([CVE-2007-5093](/security/CVE-2007-5093))

Scott James Remnant discovered a coding error in ptrace. Local users

could exploit this and cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop.

This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-5500](/security/CVE-2007-5500))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel could dereference a NULL

pointer when processing certain IPv4 TCP packets. A remote attacker

could send a crafted TCP ACK response and cause a denial of service

via crash. This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.10. ([CVE-2007-5501](/security/CVE-2007-5501))

Warren Togami discovered that the hrtimer subsystem did not properly

check for large relative timeouts. A local user could exploit this and

cause a denial of service via soft lockup. ([CVE-2007-5966](/security/CVE-2007-5966))

Venustech AD-LAB discovered a buffer overflow in the isdn net

subsystem. This issue is exploitable by local users via crafted input

to the isdn\_ioctl function. ([CVE-2007-6063](/security/CVE-2007-6063))

It was discovered that the isdn subsystem did not properly check for

NULL termination when performing ioctl handling. A local user could

exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-6151](/security/CVE-2007-6151))

Blake Frantz discovered that when a root process overwrote an existing

core file, the resulting core file retained the previous core file's

ownership. Local users could exploit this to gain access to sensitive

information. ([CVE-2007-6206](/security/CVE-2007-6206))

Hugh Dickins discovered the when using the tmpfs filesystem, under

rare circumstances, a kernel page may be improperly cleared. A local

user may be able to exploit this and read sensitive kernel data or

cause a denial of service via crash. ([CVE-2007-6417](/security/CVE-2007-6417))

Bill Roman discovered that the VFS subsystem did not properly check

access modes. A local user may be able to gain removal privileges on

directories. ([CVE-2008-0001](/security/CVE-2008-0001))
