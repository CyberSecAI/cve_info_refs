{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'keyword' parameter when handling search requests, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL commands.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information (usernames, passwords, database structure), data modification, or even complete database compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the 'keyword' parameter in the search functionality of the application's index.php file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application through a web browser and manipulate the URL to include malicious SQL code. No prior authentication or special privileges are needed for exploitation"
