{
  "Root cause": "The `SaveToFile()` method in Ultra Crypto Component (CryptoX.dll <= 2.0) is insecure.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "The `SaveToFile()` method allows writing arbitrary content to a file specified by the attacker. This can be combined with the `HexString` property to write arbitrary data to a file.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution by creating a batch file containing malicious commands. In the provided example, the attacker creates a batch file that executes notepad.exe",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a web browser that uses the vulnerable ActiveX component.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince a victim to visit a malicious website that contains the exploit code. The vulnerable ActiveX component needs to be installed and enabled on the victim's machine."
