  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the `environment.php` file, which improperly handles the `DIR_PREFIX` parameter.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include a remote file, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. This could allow them to compromise the system by uploading and executing malicious PHP scripts.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the `DIR_PREFIX` parameter to point to a remote file containing malicious code."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable `environment.php` file within the anyInventory installation. They also need a publicly accessible URL where they can host a malicious PHP file."
