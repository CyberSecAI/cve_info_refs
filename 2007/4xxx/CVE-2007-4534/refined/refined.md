Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2007-4534:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in multiple coding flaws within the Vavoom engine, specifically related to string handling and output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Format String Vulnerability (Say format string):**
    *   The `BroadcastPrintf` function is called with a user-controlled string (chat message) without proper sanitization. This allows format string specifiers (like `%n`, `%s`) in the chat message to be interpreted as formatting commands instead of literal characters, leading to potential memory corruption or information leakage.
2.  **Buffer Overflow (BroadcastPrintf buffer-overflow):**
    *   The `BroadcastPrintf` function uses a fixed-size buffer (`buf[1024]`) to format the output string. The `vsprintf` function, when called with a long string, can write beyond the buffer's boundaries, causing a buffer overflow, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
3.  **Assertion Failure ("NewLen >= 0" assertion failed):**
    *   The `VStr::Resize` function has an assertion (`check(NewLen >= 0)`) that can be triggered when a string with an invalid size is passed. This causes the server to terminate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The format string and buffer overflow vulnerabilities could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, effectively taking control of the system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The assertion failure vulnerability allows an attacker to crash the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Chat Messages:** Exploiting the format string and buffer overflow vulnerabilities can be achieved by sending specifically crafted chat messages containing format string specifiers or overly long strings.
*   **UDP Packets:** The assertion failure can be triggered by sending a malformed UDP packet to the server.
*   **Configuration File Manipulation:** Overly long names in configuration files combined with chat messages can also trigger the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker can be a user of the Vavoom server, or can send packets to the server.
*   No special privileges are needed to trigger these vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory notes that these issues affect Vavoom version 1.24 and earlier across all platforms.
*   The identified vulnerabilities allow remote exploitation.
*   A fix was released in version 1.24-3.fc7 for Fedora.
