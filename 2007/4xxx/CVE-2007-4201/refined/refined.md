{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Guidance Software's EnCase Forensic tool can only detect the first 25 partitions on a volume.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The tool has a limitation in the number of partitions it can detect, which is limited to 25 partitions.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can hide or obscure data by placing it in partitions beyond the first 25, which will not be visible using EnCase for analysis purposes.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs to create more than 25 partitions on a volume to hide data. The attacker would also need to have knowledge of this limitation to exploit it.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to create more than 25 partitions on a system, and must be aware of this limitation in EnCase."
