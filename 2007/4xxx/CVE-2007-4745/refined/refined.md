Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-4745:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the AkoBook component for Mambo. Specifically, the `gbmail` and `gbpage` parameters in the sign function (`index.php?option=com_akobook&func=sign`) are not properly sanitized before being used in the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a persistent (stored) XSS vulnerability. This occurs due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `gbmail` and `gbpage` parameters. This allows the injection of arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A successful exploit could lead to the execution of malicious JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser when they visit a page containing the injected script.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** This XSS vulnerability could be leveraged to perform various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user, including potentially privileged ones.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely.
- **Vulnerable Parameters:** Attackers inject malicious scripts via the `gbmail` and `gbpage` parameters of the `index.php?option=com_akobook&func=sign` page, typically the guestbook signing page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, making it easily exploitable by anyone who can access the affected web page.
- **Medium Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is rated as medium, likely due to the need to craft a working XSS payload and inject it into the vulnerable fields. While some characters like `<` and `>` may be blocked, single quotes can still be used to execute JavaScript via event handlers.

**Technical Details:**
- Example XSS Payload: `wawa' onload=javascript:alert(/XSS/) a='`
- Vulnerable Code Example:
    ```html
    <a href='http://wawa' onload=javascript:alert(/XSS/) a=''>
    <img src='homepage.gif' alt='http://wawa' onload=javascript:alert(/XSS/) a=''></a>
    ```
    This shows how the injected payload appears in the HTML source code.

**Affected Software:**
- Mambo component `com_akobook` versions 3.42 and earlier.
- Potentially affects Akobook component in Joomla as well.

**Remediation:**
- The recommended fix is to sanitize quotes and all other relevant characters in all form inputs.
