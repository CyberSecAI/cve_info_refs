Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-4602

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `revert-content.php` file of Micro CMS version 3.5. The `$_GET['id']` parameter is directly concatenated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it doesn't properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input (`$_GET['id']`) before using it in a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL query execution: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query, potentially allowing them to:
  - Extract sensitive data from the database. The provided exploit demonstrates retrieval of the `administrators_pass` field.
  - Modify data within the database.
  - Potentially gain control of the database server if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `revert-content.php` file. The `id` parameter in the URL is manipulated to inject SQL code.
  - Vulnerable URL Example: `http://site.com/[micro_cms]/cms/revert-content.php?type=newest&id=1%22%20UNION%20ALL%20SELECT%20null,null,SUBSTRING(administrators_pass,1,16),null,null%20FROM%20microcms_administrators/*`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote access to the web application: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the Micro CMS application.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable application: The attacker needs to know the vulnerable script (`revert-content.php`) and the parameter (`id`) to exploit the SQL injection.
