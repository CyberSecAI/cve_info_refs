```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The X font server (xfs) has a vulnerability due to a lack of validation of the 'length' parameters in the QueryXBitmaps and QueryXExtents protocol requests.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
1. Integer overflow in the calculation of the size of a dynamic buffer, leading to a heap overflow in the build_range() function.
2. Arbitrary number of bytes on the heap can be swapped by the swap_char2b() function, causing heap corruption.

Impact of exploitation:
Code execution in the font server. Privilege escalation may occur if the font server is accessible from remote clients and running with root privileges.

Attack vectors:
Maliciously crafted QueryXBitmaps and QueryXExtents protocol requests.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
Ability to send crafted requests to the X font server. Local access is sufficient, but remote access may exist on some systems.
