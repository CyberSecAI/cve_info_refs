Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2007-4948:

**Summary:** The content discusses potential Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities in Webmedia Explorer, version 3.2.2, discovered by an automated script named "arfis."

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is the use of `include()` statements with variables that are not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to potentially inject a URL leading to an external file, which the server will then execute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The script uses the `include` function with potentially controllable variables like `$path_include` and `$path_template` in multiple files. If these variables are derived from user input or other external sources without proper validation, an attacker could include a malicious file from a remote server.
    *   Specifically, the following lines are vulnerable:
        *   `wme/includes/core.lib.php`, line 3: `include ( $path_include."int.class.php" );`
        *   `wme/includes/rss.class.php`, line 3: `include ( $path_include."xdoc.class.php" );`
        *   `wme/templates/folder_messages_link_message_name.tpl.php`, line 7: `I_am_post () ) include ( $path_template."folder_messages_link_message_desc.tpl.php" ) ?>`
        *  `wme/templates/sidebar.tpl.php`, line 7: `include ( $path_templates."dirs.tpl.php" );`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could inject malicious code into the server by including a remote file containing malicious PHP code. This could lead to:
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Data Theft:** Access to sensitive data, such as database credentials.
    *   **Website Defacement:** Modification of the website's appearance or content.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Use the compromised server to distribute malware to visitors.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker needs to control or influence the `$path_include`, `$path_template`, and `$path_templates` variables.
*   This can be achieved by manipulating query parameters in the URL, HTTP headers or other forms of input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable entry points which can be done through web analysis or automated tools such as the one used by the blog author.
*   The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious payload that they will include in the vulnerable application.
*   No authentication or special privileges are necessarily required for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
* The content mentions that the RFI findings are not rechecked and the script might not be a valuable source.
* It also notes that it does not check if the variables are derived from `DOCUMENT_ROOT` or not.

This information provides more detail than a typical CVE description, detailing specific vulnerable files and lines of code, and providing additional context around the discovery and potential exploitation of the RFI vulnerabilities.
