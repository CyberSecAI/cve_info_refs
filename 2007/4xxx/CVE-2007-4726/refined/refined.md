{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization when handling file requests, allowing directory traversal via '..' sequences.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory traversal"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can access files outside the web server's document root, potentially exposing sensitive information like the /etc/passwd file.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the web server, using specially crafted URL containing directory traversal sequences.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
