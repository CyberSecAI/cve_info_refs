- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `mvcw.php` file, specifically with the `$vwar_root` variable. This variable is not properly sanitized and allows an attacker to include remote files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in `mvcw.php` due to unsanitized input of the `vwar_root` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can include a remote file, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. The provided exploit also warns that using "step=1" will delete data from the database tables.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the `mvcw.php` script with a malicious URL in the `vwar_root` parameter. They can also set `step=1` to delete database data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They do not need any prior authentication.
