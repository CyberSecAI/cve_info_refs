{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Tor's control protocol didn't terminate the connection upon receiving unrecognized commands, allowing an attacker to send HTTP headers followed by valid commands, effectively bypassing localhost binding protection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Tor control port did not close connection after receiving malformed data.",
        "Lack of proper authentication on the control port prior to executing commands.",
        "Cross-protocol attack, leveraging browser to connect to localhost port"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could rewrite the user's torrc configuration file, potentially compromising anonymity or causing other malicious effects. This could affect users of Vidalia bundles and TorK.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious website or Tor exit node could send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the Tor control port (localhost:9051).",
         "The attack can be executed without user interaction if javascript is enabled on the user's browser."
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver a webpage to the user's browser. This can be achieved either via a malicious website or a compromised Tor exit node."
