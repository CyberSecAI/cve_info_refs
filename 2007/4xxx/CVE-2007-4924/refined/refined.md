{
  "CVE-2007-4924": {
    "Description": "The opal library contained a bug in the SIP protocol handler that could be exploited by attackers to crash applications using opal. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted packet to an application linked against opal (e.g. Ekiga) causing it to crash, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient input validation on the 'Content-Length' field in SIP headers.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of SIP header fields",
      "Potential for writing a null byte to an attacker-controlled address"
    ],
     "Impact": "Denial of service. A remote attacker can cause the application using the vulnerable opal library to crash.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted SIP packet with a malformed 'Content-Length' header",
	  "Network based"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable application. No authentication or special privileges are required."
