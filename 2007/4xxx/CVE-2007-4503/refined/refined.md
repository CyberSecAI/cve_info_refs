Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `tagid` parameter of the Joomla! Component Nice Talk. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection. The application doesn't display the results of the query directly, making it a 'blind' injection. However, the attacker can still extract information from the database through the injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract sensitive data from the application's database. The provided example shows how to retrieve usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Access to user credentials can lead to further compromise of the system, including administrative access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed through a specially crafted URL using the `tagid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla application.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker requires knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the injection payloads.
*   **Understanding of blind SQL injection techniques:** Since this is a blind SQL injection, knowledge of techniques to extract data without seeing direct query results is required.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable URL is: `http://[target]/[path]//index.php?option=com_nicetalk&tagid=[SQL Inject]`
*   The example SQL injection provided is:
    `//index.php?option=com_nicetalk&tagid=-2)%20union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,999,concat(char(117,115,101,114,110,97,109,101,58),username,char(32,112,97,115,115,119,111,114,100,58),password),777,666,555,444,333,222,111%20from%20jos_users/*`
    This specific injection attempts to extract concatenated usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table, along with some dummy columns.

The provided content gives more detail than the standard CVE description which just indicates "SQL injection vulnerability" but does not specify the vulnerable parameter or component and provides an example injection payload.
