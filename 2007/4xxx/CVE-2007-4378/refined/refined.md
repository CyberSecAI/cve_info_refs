          "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Babo Violent 2 related to malformed data, format string, nonexistent maps, and malformed UDP packets.",
          "weaknesses": [
            "Crash due to malformed values in specific data IDs (0xca, 0xcb, 0xcc, 0xce, 0xcf, 0xd0) when a byte is set to 0x28 or higher.",
            "Format string vulnerability in server's output function, exploitable via messages and admin login.",
            "Server crash when a client specifies a non-existent map due to exception when opening the map file.",
            "Crash due to malformed UDP packets where a small packet with a large size is provided, leading to out-of-bounds memory read."
          ],
          "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) through crashes of both client and server, potentially allowing attackers to disrupt gameplay. Format string vulnerability could potentially lead to information disclosure or arbitrary code execution.",
          "attack_vectors": [
            "Sending specially crafted data with specific IDs to cause crashes.",
            "Exploiting the format string vulnerability through chat messages or admin login.",
