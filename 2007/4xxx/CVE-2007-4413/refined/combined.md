 [HSC] DeskPRO Admin Panel Multiple HTML Injections
An attacker may leverage this issue to have arbitrary script code execute
in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site.
This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and
launch other attacks. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise
the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the
underlying database implementation. The intresting vulnranbility in "ticket\_escalate.php"
is that from User side, HTML Injection are shown in Admin CP "admin/ticket\_escalate.php"
Such attacks can be crafted were Attacker may inject cod ewere it willsend the Admins
Cookies to Remote Attacker when Admin goes to view "ticket\_escalate.php" We also see that
in "/admincp/techs.php" If the attacker Injects Code into the Submit Form, "techs.php" Is
effected in the Admin Control Panel. Also when we Set Workflow in ticket\_rules\_web.php
with HTML Injection we get a injection result. Than there is "/admincp/user\_help.php?do=new\_entry"
This simply allows one to inject any code into the PHP file.
