```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the 'blanko.preview.php' file, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, potentially including configuration files, source code, or other critical data.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `nmf` parameter in the `blanko.preview.php` file with a path to a local file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. No specific authentication or other capabilities are mentioned beyond being able to send a specially crafted request."
