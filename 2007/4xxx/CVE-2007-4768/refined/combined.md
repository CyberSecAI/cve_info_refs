How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

CVE Ids        : CVE-2007-1659 CVE-2007-1660 CVE-2007-1661 CVE-2007-1662
                 CVE-2007-4766 CVE-2007-4767 CVE-2007-4768

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team has discovered several
security issues in PCRE, the Perl-Compatible Regular Expression library,
which potentially allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by compiling
specially crafted regular expressions.

Version 7.0 of the PCRE library featured a major rewrite of the regular
expression compiler, and it was deemed infeasible to backport the
security fixes in version 7.3 to the versions in Debian's stable and
oldstable distributions (6.7 and 4.5, respectively).  Therefore, this
update contains version 7.3, with special patches to improve the
compatibility with the older versions.  As a result, extra care is
necessary when applying this update.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2007-1659

    Unmatched \Q\E sequences with orphan \E codes can cause the compiled
    regex to become desynchronized, resulting in corrupt bytecode that may
    result in multiple exploitable conditions.

CVE-2007-1660

    Multiple forms of character class had their sizes miscalculated on
    initial passes, resulting in too little memory being allocated.

CVE-2007-1661

    Multiple patterns of the form  \X?\d or \P{L}?\d in non-UTF-8 mode
    could backtrack before the start of the string, possibly leaking
    information from the address space, or causing a crash by reading out
    of bounds.

CVE-2007-1662

    A number of routines can be fooled into reading past the end of an
    string looking for unmatched parentheses or brackets, resulting in a
    denial of service.

CVE-2007-4766

    Multiple integer overflows in the processing of escape sequences could
    result in heap overflows or out of bounds reads/writes.

CVE-2007-4767

    Multiple infinite loops and heap overflows were disovered in the
    handling of \P and \P{x} sequences, where the length of these
    non-standard operations was mishandled.

CVE-2007-4768

    Character classes containing a lone unicode sequence were incorrectly
    optimised, resulting in a heap overflow.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.7+7.4-2.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.5+7.4-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.3-1.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Chicken: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200805-11**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Chicken could result in the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-scheme/chicken** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.1.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.1.0** |

### Background

Chicken is a Scheme interpreter and native Scheme to C compiler.

### Description

Chicken includes a copy of PCRE which is vulnerable to multiple buffer
overflows and memory corruption vulnerabilities (GLSA 200711-30).

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to process specially crafted regular
expressions with Chicken, which could possibly lead to the execution of
arbitrary code, a Denial of Service or the disclosure of sensitive
information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Chicken users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-scheme/chicken-3.1.0"
```

# PCRE: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200711-30**

PCRE is vulnerable to multiple buffer overflow and memory corruption
vulnerabilities, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/libpcre** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **7.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **7.3-r1** |

### Background

PCRE is a library providing functions for Perl-compatible regular
expressions.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy (Google Security) discovered multiple vulnerabilities in
PCRE. He reported an error when processing "\Q\E" sequences with
unmatched "\E" codes that can lead to the compiled bytecode being
corrupted (CVE-2007-1659). PCRE does not properly calculate sizes for
unspecified "multiple forms of character class", which triggers a
buffer overflow (CVE-2007-1660). Further improper calculations of
memory boundaries were reported when matching certain input bytes
against regex patterns in non UTF-8 mode (CVE-2007-1661) and when
searching for unmatched brackets or parentheses (CVE-2007-1662).
Multiple integer overflows when processing escape sequences may lead to
invalid memory read operations or potentially cause heap-based buffer
overflows (CVE-2007-4766). PCRE does not properly handle "\P" and
"\P{x}" sequences which can lead to heap-based buffer overflows or
trigger the execution of infinite loops (CVE-2007-4767), PCRE is also
prone to an error when optimizing character classes containing a
singleton UTF-8 sequence which might lead to a heap-based buffer
overflow (CVE-2007-4768).

Chris Evans also reported multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities in
PCRE when processing a large number of named subpatterns ("name\_count")
or long subpattern names ("max\_name\_size") (CVE-2006-7227), and via
large "min", "max", or "duplength" values (CVE-2006-7228) both possibly
leading to buffer overflows. Another vulnerability was reported when
compiling patterns where the "-x" or "-i" UTF-8 options change within
the pattern, which might lead to improper memory calculations
(CVE-2006-7230).

### Impact

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially
crafted regular expressions to applications making use of the PCRE
library, which could possibly lead to the execution of arbitrary code,
a Denial of Service or the disclosure of sensitive information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PCRE users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libpcre-7.3-r1"
```

# GOffice: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200801-19**

Multiple vulnerabilities in GOffice could result in the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-libs/goffice** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.6.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.6.1**revision >= **0.4.3** |

### Background

GOffice is a library of document-centric objects and utilities based on
GTK.

### Description

GOffice includes a copy of PCRE which is vulnerable to multiple buffer
overflows and memory corruptions vulnerabilities (GLSA 200711-30).

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to open specially crafted documents
with GOffice, which could possibly lead to the execution of arbitrary
code, a Denial of Service or the disclosure of sensitive information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GOffice 0.4.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/goffice-0.4.3"
```

All GOffice 0.6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/goffice-0.6.1"
```

Highes curent stable is: 2.2.1: PCRE Version 6.2 2.6.0: Version 7.2  PCRE 7.3 fixes the issues mentioned. R has no newer version shipping it.

Upstream has updated to pcre-7.4 for their next R release. Meanwhile, I have updated the ebuilds to use the system libs, not just pcre.  Waiting for other sci team members to answer since I'm not a R user.   ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-15 12:54:06 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=198976#c1)) > Waiting for other sci team members to answer since I'm not a R user.   Did you intend to do a straight to stable bump?  If not, you should revert the keywords and ping us if you think it's good. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Sébastien Fabbro (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-15 20:07:15 UTC  ```  > Did you intend to do a straight to stable bump? >  > If not, you should revert the keywords and ping us if you think it's good.  It was intended: I followed blindly the gentoo developer handbook part 5.e. I did not realize it wasn't the proper way, sorry about that.  Anyway, this is now reverted: ping.   ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-15 22:27:30 UTC  ``` The handbook could be clearer on that, I agree. It is meant that there's no need to wait 30 days with security fixes, but we still require the arch teams to test.  Arches, please test and mark stable dev-lang/R-2.2.1-r1.

For what its worth I've been using R-2.6.0 (and intermediate versions as ebuilds have been updated) since its release without any problems on three x86 systems and haven't had any crashes. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-16 14:11:20 UTC  ``` This bug is for stabling a non-vulnerable version of R. It is up to the maintainers to decide *which* version that should be.  While I agree that a newer version could be more suited, if the maintainers don't agree, please open a new stabling bug. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Markus Meier   gentoo-dev  2007-11-17 01:45:03 UTC  ``` x86 stable, please note: dodoc: BUGS does not exist ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Raúl Porcel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-17 20:29:35 UTC  ``` ia64 stable ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Markus Rothe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-18 13:51:12 UTC  ``` ppc64 stable ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Tobias Scherbaum (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-18 17:40:52 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Chris Gianelloni (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-20 21:56:29 UTC  ``` amd64 done... ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-20 22:34:39 UTC  ``` request filed. ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-01-09 20:34:31 UTC  ``` GLSA 200801-02, sorry for the delay ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-01-10 13:36:50 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 205201](show_bug.cgi?id=205201 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - dev-lang/R-2.X PCRE Multiple Vulnerabilities (CVE-2007-1659,CVE-2007-1660,CVE-2007-1661,CVE-2007-1662,CVE-2007-4766,CVE-2007-4767,CVE-2007-4768)") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` |  |

Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2006-7227 CVE-2006-7228 CVE-2006-7230 CVE-2007-1659 CVE-2007-1660 CVE-2007-1661 CVE-2007-1662 CVE-2007-4766 CVE-2007-4767 CVE-2007-4768
Debian Bug     : 464756

Andrews Salomon reported that kazehakase, a GTK+-base web browser that
allows pluggable rendering engines, contained an embedded copy of the
PCRE library in its source tree which was compiled in and used in preference
to the system-wide version of this library.

The PCRE library has been updated to fix the security issues reported
against it in previous Debian Security Advisories.  This update ensures that
kazehakase  uses that supported library, and not its own embedded and
insecure version.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.4.2-1etch1.

We recommend that you upgrade your kazehakase package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Adobe Flash Player: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200801-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified, the worst of which allow
arbitrary code execution on a user's system via a malicious Flash file.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-plugins/adobe-flash** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **9.0.115.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **9.0.115.0** |

### Background

The Adobe Flash Player is a renderer for the popular SWF file format,
which is commonly used to provide interactive websites, digital
experiences and mobile content.

### Description

* Flash contains a copy of PCRE which is vulnerable to a heap-based
  buffer overflow (GLSA 200711-30, CVE-2007-4768).
* Aaron Portnoy reported an unspecified vulnerability related to
  input validation (CVE-2007-6242).
* Jesse Michael and Thomas Biege reported that Flash does not
  correctly set memory permissions (CVE-2007-6246).
* Dan Boneh, Adam Barth, Andrew Bortz, Collin Jackson, and Weidong
  Shao reported that Flash does not pin DNS hostnames to a single IP
  addresses, allowing for DNS rebinding attacks (CVE-2007-5275).
* David Neu reported an error withing the implementation of the
  Socket and XMLSocket ActionScript 3 classes (CVE-2007-4324).
* Toshiharu Sugiyama reported that Flash does not sufficiently
  restrict the interpretation and usage of cross-domain policy files,
  allowing for easier cross-site scripting attacks (CVE-2007-6243).
* Rich Cannings reported a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the
  way the "asfunction:" protocol was handled (CVE-2007-6244).
* Toshiharu Sugiyama discovered that Flash allows remote attackers to
  modify HTTP headers for client requests and conduct HTTP Request
  Splitting attacks (CVE-2007-6245).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file
(usually in a web browser), possibly leading to the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Adobe Flash
Player. The attacker could also cause a user's machine to establish TCP
sessions with arbitrary hosts, bypass the Security Sandbox Model,
obtain sensitive information, port scan arbitrary hosts, or conduct
cross-site-scripting attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Adobe Flash Player users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-plugins/adobe-flash-9.0.115.0"
```

Please be advised that unaffected packages of the Adobe Flash Player
have known problems when used from within the Konqueror and Opera
browsers.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# R: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200801-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in R could result in the execution of arbitrary
code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/R** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.2.1-r1** |

### Background

R is a GPL licensed implementation of S, a language and environment for
statistical computing and graphics. PCRE is a library providing
functions for Perl-compatible regular expressions.

### Description

R includes a copy of PCRE which is vulnerable to multiple buffer
overflows and memory corruptions vulnerabilities (GLSA 200711-30).

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to process specially crafted regular
expressions with R, which could possibly lead to the execution of
arbitrary code, a Denial of Service or the disclosure of sensitive
information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All R users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/R-2.2.1-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Kazehakase: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200801-18**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Kazehakase could result in the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/kazehakase** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.5.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.5.0** |

### Background

Kazehakase is a web browser based on the Gecko engine.

### Description

Kazehakase includes a copy of PCRE which is vulnerable to multiple
buffer overflows and memory corruptions vulnerabilities (GLSA
200711-30).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open specially crafted input
(e.g bookmarks) with Kazehakase, which could possibly lead to the
execution of arbitrary code, a Denial of Service or the disclosure of
sensitive information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Kazehakase users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
A flash player update to version 9.0.115.0 fixes several security
problems. In the worst case an attacker could potentially have flash-player
execute arbitrary code via specially crafted flash content.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Since Adobe doesn't support browsers other than Firefox and Mozilla,
this update doesn't work with other browsers such as Konqueror.
Updates for konqueror are already in the works and will hopefully be
available after the christmas holidays in January.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.
