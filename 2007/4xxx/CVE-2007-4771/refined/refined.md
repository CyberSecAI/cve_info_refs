Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2007-4771:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the regular expression engine of the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library. Specifically, the `doInterval` function in `regexcmp.cpp` does not properly limit the backtracking stack size. This can lead to excessive memory allocation during regular expression processing when the upper limit of an interval is unbounded (-1).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The lack of stack size limits in the regex engine causes uncontrolled memory allocation on the heap while backtracking, eventually leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Integer Handling Issue:** The vulnerability occurs due to an incomplete check on the upper interval value (specifically when the upper bound is -1).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by submitting a specially crafted regular expression that exhausts memory resources, leading to application crashes.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:**  It's noted that a heap-based buffer overflow *could* potentially lead to remote execution of arbitrary code, depending on the specific application's memory layout. However, most sources focus on the DoS aspect, with some indicating code execution as a possibility rather than a certainty.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Regular Expressions:** The primary attack vector is through regular expressions designed to trigger the vulnerability. An attacker can supply these malicious regular expressions to applications that use the vulnerable ICU library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs the ability to supply or induce the processing of a crafted regular expression by a vulnerable application. This indicates the exploit can occur remotely and does not require local access to the targeted system.
*   **No Special Privileges:** No special user privileges are needed for the attack.  The attacker only needs to be able to make the target application process the malicious regular expression.
*  **User Interaction (Indirect):** While the attack is remote, it often requires some level of user interaction, like a user opening a document or visiting a webpage, that triggers the vulnerable regex processing within the application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects various applications that use the ICU library, including OpenOffice.org, as it bundles an internal copy of the library, which became an issue. 
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the regular expression engine processes backreferences to capture group zero, or when unbounded upper limits are present, causing a memory exhaustion in the backtracking stack.
*   Patches were released to address the issue by limiting the stack size and handling the interval logic correctly.

**Affected Software and Versions:**

*   `dev-libs/icu` versions prior to 3.8.1-r1 are affected in Gentoo.
*   OpenOffice.org versions prior to 2.4 are affected as it was using an outdated version of `libicu`.
*  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is affected by this vulnerability, as well as several other Linux distributions that used a vulnerable `libicu` version.
*  Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 (etch) using `libicu` prior to version 3.6-2etch1, and Debian unstable (sid) using `libicu` prior to 3.8-6 were vulnerable.
* Ubuntu 7.10, 7.04, 6.10 and 6.06 are vulnerable and require updating to the given versions.
