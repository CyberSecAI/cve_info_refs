**Coppermine 1.4.13 - Security release.**

The development team is releasing a security update for Coppermine in order to counter a recently discovered cross-site-scripting vulnerability. It is important that all users who run version cpg1.4.12 or older update to this latest version as soon as possible.

To correct the security issue manually, you can apply the fixes mentioned below. Please note that applying the manual fixes will keep you secure, but it is not a substitute for updating your gallery fully, as there are several other non-security related fixes that went into cpg1.4.13 as well.

**Manual fixes** (not recommended):
To manually fix the vulnerability, edit include/init.inc.php, findCode Select Expand`/**
* CPGPluginAPI::action('page_start',null)`and add **before** it (into a new line)Code Select Expand`// If referer is set in URL and it contains 'http' or 'script' texts then set it to 'index.php' script
if (isset($_GET['referer'])) {
        if (preg_match('/((\%3C)|<)[^\n]+((\%3E)|>)|(.*http.*)|(.*script.*)/i', $_GET['referer'])) {
                $_GET['referer'] = 'index.php';
        }
}`

Edit viewlog.php, findCode Select Expand`if (!isset($log)) {
        display_log_list();
} else {
               display_log($log);
}`and replace withCode Select Expand`// If log variable not set or log file's directory is not current directory then display logs list else display log with given name stripping risky characters from it
if (!isset($log) || dirname($log) != '.') {
        display_log_list();
} else {
        display_log(ereg_replace('\.|/|%00', '', $log));
}`
