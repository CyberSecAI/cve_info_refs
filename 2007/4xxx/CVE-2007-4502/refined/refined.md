- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Joomla! Component BibTeX version 1.3 is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the `afilter` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Blind SQL injection. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information such as usernames and passwords from the database by injecting malicious SQL code into the vulnerable parameter.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the application. The `afilter` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is explicitly required according to this exploit.
