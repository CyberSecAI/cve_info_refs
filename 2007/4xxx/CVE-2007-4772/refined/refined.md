    "description": "The regular expression parser in TCL before 8.4.17, as used in PostgreSQL 8.2 before 8.2.6, 8.1 before 8.1.11, 8.0 before 8.0.15, and 7.4 before 7.4.19, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted regular expression.",

      "root_cause": "A flaw in the regular expression parser within TCL, specifically when handling loops of constraint arcs, which is used by PostgreSQL for regex processing.",

        "Infinite loop vulnerability in regex NFA optimization code."

      "impact": "A denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the server to become unresponsive due to the infinite loop. The loop can persist even after the client disconnects, hogging resources (CPU) and connections.",
