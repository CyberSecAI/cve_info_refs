Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4139:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `style` parameter within the `/wp-admin/upload.php` file in WordPress. This allows for the injection of malicious code into the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The `style` parameter, used in the `action` attribute of the upload form, is not properly escaped, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the upload page. This could lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing cookies and taking over user sessions.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious sites or displaying fake login forms to steal credentials.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Forcing the download of malicious software.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the content of the page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious code in the `style` parameter, specifically when editing temporary uploads (negative ID).
*   Example attack URL:  `/upload.php?style=%22%3E{shellcode}&tab=upload&post_id=-1337`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL with malicious code in the `style` parameter.
*   The user must visit the crafted URL while logged into WordPress.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects WordPress versions 2.2.1.
*   The fix involved using the `attribute_escape()` function to properly sanitize the `style` parameter and `post_id` parameter.
*   The initial patch used a regex, which was later deemed insufficient, and `attribute_escape` was used instead.
*   The issue was addressed in versions 2.2.2 and was backported to the 2.2.x branch.
*   The vulnerability is not present in the 2.0.x branch.

**Summary of Patches:**

*   The initial patch was a regex, however, the final solution was to use `attribute_escape()`
*   The `attribute_escape()` was applied to the `style` and `post_id` parameter.
*   The fix was backported to the 2.2.x branch.
