  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Directory Traversal",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can download arbitrary files from the server by manipulating the 'path' parameter to access files outside of the intended directory.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `index.php` with the `com_rsfiles` component.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable server."
