Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2007-4908:

**1. Remote File Attachment Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper filtering of the `$images` variable within the `/mod/contak.php` file. Specifically, the code does not adequately sanitize the filename of the uploaded file, allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the `/files/` directory.
*   **Vulnerability:** Insecure file upload mechanism. The application blindly copies the uploaded file to the `/files/` directory without proper validation or sanitization of the filename.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can upload malicious files (e.g., a PHP shell) to the server and subsequently execute them, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/mod/contak.php` page, including a malicious file in the `image` field.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to access the contact form and upload files.

**2. Local File Inclusion (LFI) Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `/index.php` file in AuraCMS versions 1.x and 2.x does not properly validate the `pilih` parameter which is used in `include` statements. The application uses `$_GET['pilih']` to include files without proper sanitization. Additionally, in AuraCMS version 1.x, if `magic_quotes_gpc` is off, the `$pilih` variable can be manipulated.
*   **Vulnerability:** Local File Inclusion. The application allows an attacker to include local files by manipulating the `pilih` parameter in the URL, effectively bypassing intended access restrictions.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read sensitive local files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`, potentially leading to information disclosure.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a URL with the `pilih` parameter containing a path to a local file (e.g., `../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to access the vulnerable `index.php` and manipulate URL parameters. If `magic_quotes_gpc` is on, the LFI vulnerability in version 1.x is mitigated, but still exists when it is off.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit-db content mentions that the LFI vulnerability can be triggered in both AuraCMS 1.x and 2.x.
*   The exploit-db content provides Proof of Concept (POC) URLs for both vulnerabilities.
*   The content suggests that `magic_quotes_gpc` needs to be off for the LFI exploit to work in AuraCMS version 1.x.
*   The exploit-db entry also lists CVE-2007-4905 and CVE-2007-4886, but does not provide information about them.
