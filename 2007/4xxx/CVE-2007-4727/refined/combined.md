Description
-------------

For a detailed description of the bug see the external reference.
This bug was found by Mattias Bengtsson <mattias@secweb.se> and

Affected versions

all previous versions.
Solutions or Workaround
-------------------------
upgrade to 1.4.18 or apply
lighttpd-1.4.x\_mod\_fastcgi\_overrun.patch
This bug is tracked as CVE-2007-4727.
---- More details -------------
Issue:
Lighttpd is prone to a header overflow when using the mod\_fastcgi extension, this can lead to arbitrary code execution in the fastcgi application.
Description:
Lighttpd (pronounced "lighty") is a web server which is designed to be secure, fast, standards-compliant, and flexible while being optimized for speed-critical environments.
Details:
fcgi\_env\_add\_request\_headers(srv, con, p);
fcgi\_header(&(header), FCGI\_PARAMS, request\_id, p->fcgi\_env->used, 0);
buffer\_append\_memory(b, (const char \*)&header, sizeof(header));
buffer\_append\_memory(b, (const char \*)p->fcgi\_env->ptr, p->fcgi\_env->used);
The above code will read up all headers requested by the client and construct the fastcgi header, which will be sent to PHP. The code does not care if contentLength is more than 0xffff, and is therefore prone to a overrun.
static int fcgi\_header(FCGI\_Header \* header, unsigned char type, size\_t request\_id, int contentLength, unsigned char paddingLength) {
...
header->contentLengthB0 = contentLength & 0xff;
header->contentLengthB1 = (contentLength >> 8) & 0xff;
...
While there are more data to send and PHP does not care how many packages it gets, it is possible to take control over the next package header and add/replace headers in PHP. For example SCRIPT\_FILENAME which we will be using in the example exploit.
Proof Of Concepts:
Since 1.4.17 we are not allowed to use any character less then 0x20 as a value in an header which makes the exploitation of the vulnerability a little bit more complicated, but still possible. For the high risk of this vulnerability we have chosen not to release a exploit for 1.4.17, but instead a fully working exploit for <= 1.4.16 and PHP 5.2.X.
Lighttpd FastCGI Remote Vulnerability Exploit
Example:
# ./exploit localhost 80 /etc/passwd
or
# wget --referer="<?php system('/usr/bin/id'); ?>" localhost
# ./exploit localhost 80 /var/log/lighttpd/access.log
Interested in a exploit for 1.4.17? Please contact us!
Impact:
The impact for this issue should be considered VERY HIGH!
Solution:
Upgrade to lighttpd 1.4.18

# Lighttpd: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200709-16**

Lighttpd is vulnerable to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/lighttpd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.18** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.18** |

### Background

Lighttpd is a lightweight HTTP web server.

### Description

Mattias Bengtsson and Philip Olausson have discovered a buffer overflow
vulnerability in the function fcgi\_env\_add() in the file mod\_fastcgi.c
when processing overly long HTTP headers.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted request to the
vulnerable Lighttpd server, resulting in the remote execution of
arbitrary code with privileges of the user running the web server. Note
that mod\_fastcgi is disabled in Gentoo's default configuration.

### Workaround

Edit the file /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf and comment the following
line: "include mod\_fastcgi.conf"

### Resolution

All Lighttpd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/lighttpd-1.4.18"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
