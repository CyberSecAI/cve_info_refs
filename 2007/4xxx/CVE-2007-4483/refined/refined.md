Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of the `PHP_SELF` variable in the WordPress Classic 1.5 theme. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code through the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The theme fails to properly sanitize the `PHP_SELF` variable, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies).
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Other attacks depending on the injected script.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL that includes JavaScript code within the path. The example given is: `http://site/index.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a malicious URL to a user of the vulnerable website. No special privileges are needed for this attack. The attacker needs to convince a user to visit the crafted URL (e.g., through social engineering).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in the WordPress Classic 1.5 theme.
*   WordPress versions 2.1.3 and later have patched this vulnerability in the Classic theme.
*   The issue is related to the improper handling of the `PHP_SELF` variable, which is often used to obtain the current URL.
