Vulnerability Table
===================
1. Windows Calendar (Vista) ICS File Denial of Service Vulnerability
2. Toolbar vulnerabilities:
a) Toolbar Gaming IE Toolbar Denial of Service Vulnerability
b) ExportNation IE Toolbar Denial of Service Vulnerability
c) Advanced Searchbar Denial of Service Vulnerability
Information Table
=================
1. OpenOffice 2.2 Multiple File Extensions Handling Denial of Service Issue
Vulnerability Details
=========================
=========================
1. Windows Calendar (Vista) ICS File Denial of Service Vulnerability
=================================================================
Specially malformed ISC file, once imported to Windows Calendar,
leads to Windows Calendar to a crash (after the remainder is set).
Windows Calendar crashes every each time Vista is rebooted. The
vulnerability stems from NULL pointer dereference and has been
confirmed on fully updated Windows Vista. Successful at
MSRC has been informed and confirmed the situation. Both, Eleytt
and MSRC consider this issue of low impact.
2. Toolbar vulnerabilities
=======================
a) The vulnerability in 'CallCmd' function in toolbar\_gaming.dll
has its roots in NULL pointer dereference, which results in
denial of service conditions.
b) The vulnerability lies in Toolbar.DLL library, in 'isChecked'
function.
The registers' values are below:
EIP 01838C70
EAX 00000000
.
ESP 001BA90C -> Asc: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
The crash itself happens here:
1838C70 MOV ECX,[EAX+188]
Stack dump is full of 'A', but SEH hasn't been overwritten. The problem
lies in NULL pointer dereference. The vulnerability, therefore, hasn't
been proven exploitable. Arbitrary code execution is probably impossible.
c) The vulnerability lies in Toolbar.DLL library, in 'isChecked'
function. The exactly the same kind of vulnerability that described
in b).
Information Table
