        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a user-controlled variable $vwar_root in the file modules/vwar/convert/mvcw_conver.php without proper sanitization or validation.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, leading to potential compromise of the server, data breaches, and other malicious activities.",
        "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL with the 'vwar_root' parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled server hosting malicious code, and triggering the vulnerable file",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and needs to control a remote server to host the malicious code."
