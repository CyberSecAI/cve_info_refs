How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Eugene Medvedev    2007-03-11 20:10:03 UTC  ``` Festival as it is currently set up by portage when installed runs under the root user. If a festival daemon setup is used, the default server password is nil, i.e. absent.  When the daemon is running, anyone who can connect to the festival daemon at the normal TCP port can issue the '(system "<whatever>")' command, which will execute with root privileges. The default configuration denies connection from anywhere but localhost, but local users can connect and execute commands from root regardless.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: Using the festival_client.pl provided in /usr/share/doc/festival-*/ connect to your localhost festival daemon with a non root user, and enter the command (system "whoami > /tmp/amiroot") then exit the client and cat /tmp/amiroot    There's several approaches to fixing this, but giving the daemon it's own user account seems the best approach. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-03-12 15:25:04 UTC  ``` thanks for your report.

It shouldn't be disabled altogether because festival extensively uses it internally (for example, it is required to use mbrola voices). Also, I think I've seen several code examples which involve using it from the client to play the speech festival generates, so you probably can't prevent the client from using it without breaking stuff. But it definitely doesn't have to be root. :)  Adding the festival user to the audio group in the ebuild would be a good idea, by the way. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Samuli Suominen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-05 11:04:55 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=170477#c9)) > Created an attachment (id=121219) [edit] > festival-bug-170477.diff >  > How about something like this?

Considering that connections are only allowed from localhost in the default configuration, you have to be a local user already to do that, or am I missing something?  ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-05 15:27:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=170477#c10)) > Adding the festival user to the audio group in the ebuild would be a good idea, > by the way.

The server.scm configuration file that comes with the ebuild actually contains:  ; Server access list (hosts) (set! server_access_list '("[^.]+" "127.0.0.1" "localhost.*" "192.168.*"))  If 192.168.* is allowed, and you can (system "<whatever>") from a different machine, the argument about using festival to try local exploits still stands.  Maybe adding a warning to set a server password if you plan to connect to festival remotely is also in order. ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-06 02:23:52 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=170477#c15)) > Oh, almost forgot, just noticed this.

Things like apache, clamav, lighttpd, mysql, snort and squid all use a subdir in  /var/log/ that is owned by that user.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- hplip command injection
The daemon 'hpssd' could be exploited by users to execute arbitrary
commands as root. hpssd only runs on systems that have HP all-in-one
devices configured. In the default configuration the problem is
not remotely exploitable as hpssd only listens on local interfaces
(CVE-2007-5208).
This issue has been fixed for SUSE Linux 10.0-10.3, and SUSE Linux
Enterprise Desktop 10.
- kdelibs3, kdebase3 security update
kdebase3 and kdelibs3 were updated on all affected SUSE Linux
products to fix the following problems:
- Users could log in as root without having to enter the password
if auto login was enabled and if kdm was configured to require
the root password to shutdown the system (CVE-2007-4569).
- Javascript code could modify the URL in the address bar to make
the currently displayed web site appear to come from a different
site (CVE-2007-4224).
- NX security update for PCF handling
The XFree code contained in NX was prone to integer overflows
(CVE-2006-1861) and insufficiently protected against specially
crafted PCF files (CVE-2006-3467).
NX has been updated on SUSE Linux 10.0-10.3, it is not contained
on other distributions.
- festival daemon command injection
The festival daemon runs as root (if started). The default config
doesn't have a password set. A local attacker could therefore connect
to the daemon to have commands executed as root (CVE-2007-4074).
festival has been updated on all affected products.
- opal denial of service problem
The opal library contained a bug in the SIP protocol handler that
could be exploited by attackers to crash applications using opal
(CVE-2007-4924).
Opal has been updated on openSUSE 10.2, 10.3 and SUSE Linux
Desktop 10.
- openssl DTLS problem
A buffer overflow in the DTLS implementation of openssl could
be exploited by attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2007-4995).
openssl has been updated on all distributions that contain DTLS
support.
It is questionable if the DTLS support even worked before or used
by applications at all, so we were likely not affected.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.

# Festival: Privilege elevation — GLSA **200707-10**

A vulnerability has been discovered in Festival, allowing for a local
privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-accessibility/festival** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.95\_beta-r4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.95\_beta-r4** |

### Background

Festival is a text-to-speech accessibility program.

### Description

Konstantine Shirow reported a vulnerability in default Gentoo
configurations of Festival. The daemon is configured to run with root
privileges and to listen on localhost, without requiring a password.

### Impact

A local attacker could gain root privileges by connecting to the daemon
and execute arbitrary commands.

### Workaround

Set a password in the configuration file /etc/festival/server.scm by
adding the line: (set! server\_passwd password)

### Resolution

All Festival users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-accessibility/festival-1.95_beta-r4"
```
