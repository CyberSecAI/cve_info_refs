| | KEYNOTE: A Story About Digital Security in 2017 Richard Clarke, Chairman, Good Harbor Consulting | | --- | | To those who seek truth through science, even when the powerful try to suppress it. | | Richard A. Clarke is a former U.S. government official who specialized in intelligence, cyber security and counter-terrorism. Until his retirement in January 2003, Mr. Clarke was a member of the Senior Executive Service. He served as an advisor to four U.S. presidents from 1973 to 2003: Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Most notably, Clarke was the chief counter-terrorism adviser on the U.S. National Security Council for both the latter part of the Clinton Administration and early part of the George W. Bush Administration through the time of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Clarke came to widespread public attention for his role as counter-terrorism czar in the Clinton and Bush Administrations when in March of 2004 he appeared on the 60 Minutes television news magazine, his memoir about his service in government, Against All Enemies was released, and he testified before the 9/11 Commission. In all three instances, Clarke was sharply critical of the Bush Administration's attitude toward counter-terrorism before the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the decision to go to war with Iraq.  Richard Clarke is currently Chairman of Good Harbor Consulting, a strategic planning and corporate risk management firm, an on-air consultant for ABC News, and a contributor to GoodHarborReport.com, an online community discussing homeland security, defense, and politics. He also recently published his first novel, The Scorpion's Gate, in 2005; and a second, Breakpoint, in 2007. |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | KEYNOTE: The NSA Information Assurance Directorate and the National Security Community Tony Sager, Chief, Vulnerability Analysis and Operations Group, Information Assurance Directorate, National Security Agency | | --- | | The Information Assurance Directorate (IAD) within the National Security Agency (NSA) is charged in part with providing security guidance to the national security community. Within the IAD, the Vulnerability Analysis and Operations (VAO) Group identifies and analyzes vulnerabilities found in the technology, information, and operations of the Department of Defense (DoD) and our other federal customers. This presentation will highlight some of the ways that the VAO Group is translating vulnerability knowledge in cooperation with many partners, into countermeasures and solutions that scale across the entire community. This includes the development and release of security guidance through the NSA public website [(www.nsa.gov)](http://www.nsa.gov "www.nsa.gov") and sponsorship of a number of community events like the Cyber Defense Initiative and the Red Blue Symposium. It also includes support for, or development of, open standards for vulnerability information (like CVE, the standard naming scheme for vulnerabilities); the creation of the extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF) to automate the implementation and measurement of security guidance; and joint sponsorship, with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), of the Information Security Automation Program (ISAP), to help security professionals automate security compliance and manage vulnerabilities.  The presentation will also discuss the cultural shift we have been making to treat network security as a community problem, one that requires large -scale openness and cooperation with security stakeholders at all points in the security supply chain—operators, suppliers, buyers, authorities and practitioners. | | Tony Sager is the Chief of the Vulnerability Analysis and Operations (VAO) Group, part of the Information Assurance Directorate at the National Security Agency. The mission of the VAO organization is to identify, characterize, and put into operational context vulnerabilities found in the technology, information, and operations of the DoD and the national security community and to help the community identify countermeasures and solutions. This group is known for its work developing and releasing security configuration guides to provide customers with the best options for securing widely used products. The VAO Group also helps to shape the development of security standards for vulnerability naming and identification, such as the Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL), partnering with National Institute for Standards and technology (NIST) on the Information Security Automation Program (ISAP), developing the eXtensible configuration checklist description format (XCCDF), and for hosting the annual Cyber Defense Exercise and the Red Blue Symposium. Mr. Sager is active in the public network security community, as a member of the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) Senior Advisory Council and the Strategic Advisory Council for The Center for Internet Security. He is in his 29th year with the National Security Agency, all of which he has spent in the computer and network security field. |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | KEYNOTE: The Psychology of Security Bruce Schneier, Founder and CTO, BT Counterpane | | --- | | Security is both a feeling and a reality. You can feel secure without actually being secure, and you can be secure even though you don't feel secure. In the industry, we tend to discount the feeling in favor of the reality, but the difference between the two is important. It explains why we have so much security theater that doesn't work, and why so many smart security solutions go unimplemented. Two different fields—behavioral economics and the psychology of decision making—shed light on how we perceive security, risk, and cost. Learn how perception of risk matters and, perhaps more importantly, learn how to design security systems that will actually get used. | | Bruce Schneier is an internationally renowned security technologist and CTO of BT Counterpane, referred to by The Economist as a "security guru." He is the author of eight books—including the best sellers "Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly about Security in an Uncertain World," "Secrets and Lies," and "Applied Cryptography"—and hundreds of articles and academic papers. His influential newsletter, Crypto-Gram, and blog "Schneier on Security," are read by over 250,000 people. He is a prolific writer and lecturer, a frequent guest on television and radio, has testified before Congress, and is regularly quoted in the press on issues surrounding security and privacy. |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | Dangling Pointer Jonathan Afek, Senior Security Researcher, Watchfire | | --- | | A Dangling Pointer is a well known security flaw in many applications.  When a developer writes an application, he/she usually uses pointers to many data objects. In some scenarios, the developer may accidentally use a pointer to an invalid object. In such a case, the application will enter an unintended execution flow which could lead to an application crash or other types of dangerous behaviors. | | Jonathan Afek is a senior security researcher for Watchfire, a market-leading provider of software and service to help ensure the security and compliance of websites.  In his role as senior security researcher Jonathan is responsible for researching new web application vulnerabilities, performing application security audits and developing security related features for Watchfire’s market leading AppScan solution. Jonathan specializes in network and web application security, reverse engineering and exploit development. |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | Fuzzing Sucks! (or Fuzz it Like you Mean it!) Pedram Amini, Lead, Security Research and Product Security Assessment Team at TippingPoint, a division of 3Com Aaron Portnoy, Researcher, TippingPoint Security Research Team (TSRT) | | --- | | Face it, fuzzing sucks. Even the most expensive commercial fuzzing suites leave much to be desired by way of automation. Perhaps the reason for this is that even the most rudimentary fuzzers are surprisingly effective. None the less, if you are serious about fuzz testing in as much a scientific process as possible than you have no doubt been disappointed with the current state of affairs. Until now.  This talk is about Sulley. An open source, freely available, full featured and extensible fuzzing framework being released at Black Hat US 2007. Modern day fuzzers are, for the most part, solely focused on data generation. Sulley does this better and more. Sulley watches the network and methodically maintains records. Sulley instruments and monitors the health of the target, capable of reverting to a good state using multiple methods. Sulley detects, tracks and categorizes detected faults. Sulley can fuzz in parallel, significantly increasing test speed. Sulley can automatically determine what unique sequence of test cases trigger faults. Sulley does all this, and more, automatically and without attendance. | | Pedram Amini currently leads the security research and product security assessment team at TippingPoint, a division of 3Com. Previous to TippingPoint, he was the assistant director and one of the founding members of iDEFENSE Labs. Despite the fancy titles he spends much of his time in the shoes of a reverse engineer—developing automation tools, plug-ins and scripts. His most recent projects (aka "babies") include the PaiMei reverse engineering framework and the Sulley fuzzing framework.  In conjunction with his passion for the field, he launched OpenRCE.org, a community website dedicated to the art and science of reverse engineering. He has previously presented at DefCon, RECon, ToorCon and taught numerous sold out reverse engineering courses. Pedram holds a computer science degree from Tulane University, finds his current commander in chief rather humerous and recently co-authored a book on Fuzzing titled "Fuzzing: Brute Force Vulnerability Discovery".  Aaron Portnoy, aka deft, is a researcher within TippingPoint's security research group. His responsibilities include reverse engineering, vulnerability discovery, and tool development. Aaron has discovered critical vulnerabilities affecting a wide range of enterprise vendors including: RSA, Citrix, Symantec, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and others.  Additionally, Aaron has contributed mind share and code to OpenRCE, PaiMei, and various white papers and books. On a more personal note, Aaron is the proud owner of a Rottweiler/German Shepherd puppy and he also drives really (really) fast. |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | Kick Ass Hypervisoring: Windows Server Virtualization Brandon Baker, Security Developer, Windows Kernel Team, Microsoft | | --- | | Virtualization is changing how operating systems function and how enterprises manage data centers. Windows Server Virtualization, a component of Windows Server 2008, will introduce new virtualization capabilities to the Windows operating system. This talk will focus on security model of the system, with emphasis on design choices and deployment considerations. Aspects of virtualization security related to hardware functions will also be explored. | | Brandon Baker is a security developer in the Windows kernel team working on the Windows hypervisor and leading security development and testing for the Windows Server Virtualization project. For the past five years he has worked on security and separation kernels at Microsoft of one form or another. Prior to joining Microsoft, Mr. Baker was a security architect at a managed data center company. He has been working in the computer security field since 1997, when at NSA he co-authored the first guide for the secure configuration of Windows NT for the DoD. Mr. Baker has a B.S. in Computer Science from Texas A&M University. |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | Injecting RDS-TMC Traffic Information Signals a.k.a. How to freak out your Satellite Navigation Andrea Barisani, co-Founder and Chief Security Engineer, Inverse Path Ltd. Daniele Bianco | | --- | | RDS-TMC is a standard based on RDS (Radio Data System) for communicating over FM radio Traffic Information for Satellite Navigation Systems.  All modern in-car Satellite Navigation systems sold in Europe use RDS-TMC to receive broadcasts containing up to date information about traffic conditions such as queues and accidents and provide detours in case they affect the plotted course. The system is increasingly being used around Europe and North America.  The audience will be introduced to RDS/RDS-TMC concepts and protocols and we'll show how to decode/encode such messages using a standard PC and cheap home-made electronics, with the intent of injecting information in the broadcast RDS-TMC stream manipulating the information displayed by the satellite navigator.  We'll discover the obscure (but scary!) messages that can be broadcast (and that are not usually seen over legitimate RDS-TMC traffic), the limits of standard SatNav systems when flooded with unusual messages and the role that RDS-TMC injection/jamming can play in social engineering attempts (hitmen in the audience will love this!).  In order to maximize the presentation we'll also demo the injection...hopefully at low power so that we won't piss off local radio broadcasts. | | Andrea Barisani is a system administrator and security consultant. His professional career began 8 years ago but all really started when a Commodore-64 first arrived in his home when he was 10. Now, 16 years later, Andrea is having fun with large-scale IDS/Firewalls deployment and administration, forensic analysis, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, security training and his Open Source projects. He eventually found that system and security administration are the only effective way to express his need for paranoia. He's currently involved with the Gentoo project managing infrastructure server security being a member of the Gentoo Security and Infrastructure Teams along with distribution development. Being an active member of the international Open Source and security community he's maintainer/author of the tenshi, ftester and openssh-lpk projects and he's been involved in the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual, becoming a ISECOM Core Team member. Outside the community he has been a security consultant for Italian firms and he's now the co-founder and Chief Security Engineer of Inverse Path Ltd. |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | Smoke 'em Out! Rohyt Belani, Managing Partner, Intrepidus Group. Keith J. Jones, Owner and Senior Partner, Jones Rose Dykstra & Associates | | --- | | Tracing a malicious insider is hard; proving their guilt even harder. In this talk, we will discuss the challenges faced by digital investigators in solving electronic crime committed by knowledgeable insiders. These challenges will be presented in light of three real world investigations conducted by the presenters. The focus of this talk will on the technicalities of the attacks, the motivation of the attackers, and the response techniques used by the investigators to solve the respective crimes.  The first case is the high-profile U.S. v Duronio trial, in which Keith Jones testified as the DoJ's computer forensics expert. Mr. Jones testified for over five days about how Mr. Duronio, a disgruntled employee, planted a logic bomb within UBS's network to render critical trading servers unusable. His testimony was key in the prosecution of the accused on charges of securities fraud and electronic crime. Mr. Jones will present the information as he did to the jury during this trial.  The second incident involved a recently fired employee at a large retail organization. The irked employee made his way from a store wireless network into the company's core credit card processing systems. The purpose of the attack was to malign the company's image by releasing the stolen data on the Internet. We will discuss the anatomy of the "hack", the vulnerabilities exploited along the way, and our sleepless nights in Miami honing in on the attacker.  The final case presented will focus on the technicalities of web browser forensics and how it facilitated the uncovering of critical electronic evidence that incriminated a wrong-doer, and more importantly freed an innocent systems administrator at a law firm from being terminated and facing legal music.  The common thread in all these cases—a malicious insider! | | Rohyt Belani is a regular speaker at various industry conferences including Black Hat, OWASP, InfoSec World, Hack In The Box, and several forums catering to the FBI and US Secret Service agents.

Sphinx has been implemented as an Apache module (like ModSecurity, the most deployed Web Application Firewall), therefore can deal with SSL and POST data. Our system uses different techniques at the same time to improve detection and false positive rates. Being anomaly-based, Sphinx needs a training phase before the real detection could start: during the training, Sphinx “learns” automatically the type of each parameter inside user requests and applies the most suitable model to detect attacks. We define 3 basic types: numerical, short and long texts. The idea behind this is that, e.g., if we observe only integer values and later some text, that is likely to be an attack (e.g. SQL Injection or XSS).  For numerical parameters, a type checker is applied. For short texts (text with fixed length or slight variations), Sphinx uses a grammar checker: grammars are built observing the parameter content (during the training phase) and then used to check the similarity of new content during detection. Long texts are typically e-mail/forum messages, which change often their length and would produce infeasible grammars. For this kind of content we use a modified version of our NIDS POSEIDON, using n-gram analysis.  Furthermore, Sphinx can actively support the deployment of WAFs like ModSecurity: e.g. if we are deploying an ad hoc web application, most probably we need to spend a lot of time on writing signatures (or when 3rd parties’ software is used). Once Sphinx accomplishes the training phase, it can automatically generates ModSecurity-style signatures for numerical and (some) short-text parameters, making the deployment much easier. | | Damiano Bolzoni is currently a PhD student at the University of Twente, Netherlands. He received a MSc in Computer Science from the University of Venice, Italy, with a thesis about anomaly-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems. He has been working for a year at the Information Risk Management division in KPMG Italy. His research topics are IDS and risk management.

One can explain this by the fact that any hacker can take control over every vulnerable laptop without having any "visible" connection with those laptops and execute a malicious code in kernel.  This work describes the process behind hunting remote and local vulnerabilities in wireless LAN drivers as well as in other types of network drivers. The first part of the work describes simple and much more advanced examples of remote execution vulnerabilities in wireless device drivers that should be considered during vulnerabilities search. We demonstrate an example design of kernel-mode payload and construct a simple wireless frames fuzzer. The second part of the work explains local privilege escalation vulnerabilities in I/O Control device driver interface on Microsoft® Windows®, introduces a technique to uncover them. The third part of the work describes specific examples of local vulnerabilities in network drivers that can be exploited remotely and an exploitation technique. In the last part of the work we present case studies of remote and local vulnerabilities mitigated in Intel® Centrino® wireless LAN device drivers. | | Yuriy Bulygin is a member of Security Center of Excellence (SeCoE) and Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) at Intel Corporation.

Jamie Butler, Principal Software Engineer, MANDIANT Kris Kendall, MANDIANT | | --- | | Malicious software authors use code injection techniques to avoid detection, bypass host-level security controls, thwart the efforts of human analysts, and make traditional memory forensics ineffective. Often a forensic examiner or incident response analyst may not know the weaknesses of the tools they are using or the advantage the attacker has over those tools by hiding in certain locations.  This session provides a detailed exploration of code injection attacks and novel countermeasures, including:   1. The technical details of code injection starting with basic user land techniques and continuing through to the most advanced kernel injection techniques faced today.- Case study of captured malware that reveals how these techniques are used in real world situations.- Discussion of current memory forensic strengths and weaknesses.- New memory forensic analysis techniques for determining if a potential victim machine has been infected via code injection.- Post acquisition analysis. | | James (“Jamie”) Butler II is a Principal Software Engineer at MANDIANT.

DNS-pinning is a technique web browsers use to prevent a malicious server from hijacking HTTP sessions. Anti-DNS pinning is a newly recognized threat that, while not well understood by most security professionals, is far from theoretical.  This presentation will focus on a live demonstration using anti-DNS pinning techniques to interact with internal servers through a victim web browser, completely bypassing perimeter firewalls. In essence, the victim browser becomes a proxy server for the external attacker. No browser bugs or plug-ins are required to accomplish this, only JavaScript, and untrusted Java applets for more advanced features.  If anyone still thought that perimeter firewalls could protect their intranet servers, this presentation will convince them otherwise. | | David Byrne is a seven year veteran of the Information Security industry specializing in web application security. He is currently the Security Architect for EchoStar Satellite, owner of Dish Network. David is also the founder and current leader of the Denver chapter of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | Traffic Analysis—The Most Powerful and Least Understood Attack Methods Jon Callas, Chief Technology Officer & Chief Security Officer, PGP Corporation Raven Alder Riccardo Bettati, Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science, Texas A&M University Nick Matthewson, Developer, Tor privacy network | | --- | | Traffic analysis is gathering information about parties not by analyzing the content of their communications, but through the metadata of those communications. It is not a single technique, but a family of techniques that are powerful and hard to defend against.

First, find the most heavily used functionality, including the first points of entry into the product. Then, perform the most obvious attacks against the most common vulnerabilities. Using this crude method, even unskilled attackers can break into an insecure application within minutes. The developer likely faces a long road ahead before the product can become tolerably secure; the customer is sitting on a ticking time bomb. This turbo talk will identify some of the Unforgivable Vulnerabilities that illustrate a systematic disregard for secure development practices. I will conclude with a call-to-arms for establishing Vulnerability Assessment Assurance Levels (VAAL), and nominate these Unforgivable Vulnerabilities as examplars of VAAL-0. | | Steve Christey is a Principal Information Security Engineer in the Security and Information Operations Division at The MITRE Corporation.

In 2006 alone, CERT has recognized over 8,000 published vulnerabilities in applications. Attackers were previously occupied by the weaker operating systems and have moved on to easier targets: applications. What makes this situation worse, is the weaponization of these exploits and the business drivers behind them. Some organizations struggle to deal with this trend to try to protect their products and customers. Other organizations have nothing in place, and need to create measures as soon as possible.  This talk will raise several issues that global enterprise organizations currently face with application security and how to overcome them in a cost-effective manner. Some of the issues that will be discussed are software development lifecycle integration, global policy and compliance issues, necessary developer awareness and automated tools, and accurate metrics collection and tracking to measure the progress. Attendees will be introduced to best practices which have worked for McAfee and other large scale global enterprises, and be shown which practices to avoid. If you're only going to invest in a single activity to start, this talk will help you figure out what it should be, and how to measure its success. | | David Coffey is the manager of product security at McAfee.

An evolutionary test tool receiving such statistics can use that information as fitness for pools of sessions to actively learn the interface protocol. We call this activity grey-box fuzzing. We intend to show that, when applicable, grey-box fuzzing is more effective at finding bugs than RFC compliant or capture-replay mutation black-box tools. This research is focused on building a better/new breed of fuzzer. The impact of which is the discovery of difficult to find bugs in real world applications which are accessible (not theoretical).  We have successfully combined an evolutionary approach with a debugged target to get real-time grey-box code coverage (CC) fitness data. We build upon existing test tool General Purpose Fuzzer (GPF) [8], and existing reverse engineering and debugging framework PaiMei [10] to accomplish this. We call our new tool the Evolutionary Fuzzing System (EFS).  We have shown that it is possible for our system to learn the targets language (protocol) as target communication sessions become more fit over time. We have also shown that this technique works to find bugs in a real world application. Initial results are promising though further testing is still underway.

Attackers frequently use well known ports that are open through most firewalls to tunnel commands for controlling zombie systems.  This presentation shows that a framework is indeed possible to identify encrypted protocols or anomalous usage of well known ports. The framework relies on performing statistical analysis on protocol packets and flows, and uniquely maps each protocol in a 10-dimensional space. Clustering algorithms are applied to accurately identify a wide variety of protocols.  This novel approach provides network and security administrators a powerful tool to use in enforcing traffic policy, even when users are actively attempting to evade these policies.

H.323 is a well known technology; however, its security issues are not well publicized. While previous VoIP presentations and/or whitepapers discuss SIP security extensively, much is to be desired about H.323 security content and attack tools. Despite the fact that H.323 is most dominant VoIP session-setup protocol used in enterprise environments, it has not been given adequate attention in terms of security. The presentation will cover specific security attacks targeting H.323 authentication weaknesses, replay attacks, endpoint spoofing (E.164 alias), hopping attacks, and a sleuth of DOS attacks that can be executed with a few UDP packets. The presentation will also include a demonstration of new tool for H.323 security testing (H.323-me-ASAP.exe), which will be released at the conference.  In addition to the H.323 material, IAX security issues, attacks, and exploits will also be presented. While SIP/H.323 with RTP has been “face” of VoIP for many years, newer protocols such as IAX are gaining momentum (as shown with the popular open source Asterisk PBX system). IAX can be used for session setup as well as media transfer, providing a nice self-contained VoIP protocol that can be used to replace the combination of either SIP/H.323 with RTP. Similar to H.323, IAX has room for improvement in terms of security. The presentation will discuss security attacks on IAX, specifically authentication weaknesses that lead to offline dictionary attacks, pre-computed dictionary attacks, middle person attacks, and downgrade attacks on IAX clients. In addition to the authentication attacks, the presentation will show how DOS attacks can disrupt an IAX network and its devices quite easily. Each IAX attack shown will be demonstrated with three new attack tools for IAX security testing (IAX.Brute, IAXAuthJack, and IAXHangup), which will also be released at the conference.  The presentation will concluded with existing solutions to mitigate both the H.323 and IAX security issues discussed during the presentation. | | Himanshu Dwivedi is a founding partner of iSEC Partners, an independent information security organization, with 12 years experience in security and information technology.

Although it's true that kernel-mode exploitation often presents some new challenges for exploit developers, it still all boils down to "creative debugging" and knowledge about the target in question.  This talk intends to demystify kernel-mode exploitation by demonstrating the analysis and reliable exploitation of several real-life kernel vulnerabilities. From a defender's point of view this could hopefully serve as an eye-opener, as it demonstrates the ineffectiveness of HIDS, NX, ASLR and other protective measures when the kernel itself is being exploited.  The entire process will be discussed, including how the vulnerabilities were found, how they were analyzed to determin if and how they can be reliably exploited and of course the exploits will be demonstrated in practice.  None of the vulnerabilities that will be used as examples had public exploits by the time they were exploited by us, and includes the (in)famous Windows 2000/XP GDI bug, the FreeBSD 802.11 bug and a local NetBSD vulnerability.  We will also demonstrate a full exploit for the remote OpenBSD ICMPv6 vulnerability found by CORE SDI, and discuss the payload techniques we used for it.

Far from its origin as an application for fetching and rendering HTML, today’s web browser offers an expansive attack surface to exploit. All the major browsers now include full-featured runtime engines for a variety of interpreted scripting languages, including the popular JavaScript. The web experience now depends more than ever on the ability of the browser to dynamically interpret JavaScript on the client.  The authors present a software framework for the automated collection of JavaScript from the wild, the subsequent identification of malicious code, and characteristic analysis of malicious code once identified. Building on the work of several existing client honeypot implementations, our goal is to largely automate the painstaking work of malicious software collection. Our focus is on attacks using JavaScript for obfuscation or exploitation.  The authors will present findings based on the deployment of a distributed network of CaffeineMonkeys. The analysis and conclusions will focus on identifying new in-the-wild obfuscation / evasion techniques and JavaScript browser exploits, quantifying the prevalence and distribution of well-known and newly discovered obfuscation and evasion techniques, as well as quantifying the prevalence and distribution of known and newly discovered JavaScript browser exploits.  The authors will release a previously unpublished JavaScript evasion technique and demonstrate its use in evading a variety of present-day defensive technologies.

Databases store and process critical healthcare, financial and corporate data, yet businesses place very little focus on securing and logging the underlying database transactions. As well, in an effort to trim costs, many organizations are consolidating several databases on to single mission critical systems which are frequently targeted by attackers. With large data security breaches occurring at an alarming rate, several database logging tools have been released in the industry, however adoption of these products is slow leaving these mission critical systems vulnerable and ill-equipped for traditional forensic analysis.

Unlike the protocols that comprise the internet as a whole, these haven't been scrutinized to death for security flaws. They're written with performance in mind and security is often just an afterthought, if present at all. And there are dozens of them, with names you may have never heard of before...  This talk will discuss the security implications of the protocols and technologies used by the financial industry to maintain the beating heart of capitalism. We'll take a look at some of the most popular protocols used by financials to execute billions (trillions!) of dollars worth of trades, discuss the flaws inherent in them, some of the implementation flaws in them, and discuss how hiding your money under your mattress might not be the worst idea. | | Jeremy Rauch For over 10 years Jeremy Rauch has been at the forefront of information security.

The malicious capabilities of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgeries (CSRF), coupled with JavaScript malware payloads, exploded in 2006. Intranet Hacking from the Outside, Browser Port Scanning, Browser History Stealing, Blind Web Server Fingerprinting, and dozens of other bleeding-edge attack techniques blew away our assumptions that perimeter firewalls, encryption, A/V, and multi-actor authentication can protect websites from attack.  One quote from a member of the community summed it way:  "The last quarter of this year (2006), RSnake and Jeremiah pretty much destroyed any security we thought we had left—including the "I'll just browse without JavaScript" mantra. Could you really call that browsing anyway?"–Kryan  That's right. New research is revealing that even if JavaScript has been disabled or restricted, some of the now popular attack techniques—such as Browser Intranet Hacking, Port Scanning, and History Stealing—can still be perpetrated. From an enterprise security perspective, when users are visiting "normal" public websites (including web mail, blogs, social networks, message boards, news, etc.), there is a growing probability that their browser might be silently hijacked by a hacker and exploited to target the resources of the internal corporate network.  This years new and lesser-known attacks attack techniques Anti-DNS Pinning, Bypassing Mozilla Port Blocking/Vertical Port Scanning, sophisticated filter evasion, Backdooring Media Files, Exponential XSS, and Web Worms are also finding their way into the attackers' arsenals.

Many widely deployed applications were developed in haste and are often ridden with SQL injection, file inclusion and cross-site scripting bugs, creating weak links in any Internet-exposed environment.  In this presentation, CoreLabs researchers Ezequiel Gutesman and Ariel Waissbein will address this issue by introducing a new application protection technology that efficiently identifies and blocks several attack vectors “on the fly.” The protection technique is based on very granular run-time taint analysis of an application’s data and does not require access or changes to the application’s source code.  Applications written in the most common web scripting languages, including PHP, ASP, Python, Perl and Java, can be protected using this technology to prevent database injection, shell injection, cross-site scripting and directory-transversal attacks. A fully functional implementation of the protection technique for PHP will be described in detail. | | Ezequiel Gutesman is a researcher at Corelabs, the research unit at Core Security Technologies and Computer Science student at University of Buenos Aires.

Sadly, Windows XP, and even Vista, are stuck in the 1980s with old-fashioned BIOS. But with Boot Camp, the Mac can operate smoothly in both centuries." —Quote taken from http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/  The Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) has long been touted as the replacement for the traditional BIOS and was chosen by Apple as the pre-boot environment for Intel-based Macs. This presentation explores the security implications of EFI on firmware-based rootkits.  We start by discussing the limitations of the traditional BIOS and the growing need for an extensible pre-boot environment. We also cover the key components of the EFI Framework and take a look at the fundamental design decisions affecting EFI and their consequences. Next we consider the entry points that an EFI system exposes—just how an attacker may set about getting their code into the EFI environment—taking the Apple Macbook as our reference implementation.  After demonstrating several means of achieving the above, we turn our attention to subverting the operating system from below, drawing parallels wherever possible to attacks against systems running a traditional BIOS.  The final part of this presentation discusses the evolution of EFI into the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), soon to be supported by Windows Server (Longhorn) and discusses the application of the previously discussed attacks to UEFI. | | John Heasman is the Director of Research at NGS Software.

Windows Vista features a rewritten network stack, which introduces a number of core behavior changes. New protocols include IPv6 and related protocols, LLTD, LLMNR, SMB2, PNRP, PNM, and WSD. One of the IPv4-IPv6 transition mechanisms provided by Vista is Teredo, which tunnels IPv6 through a NAT by using IPv4 UDP. This provides globally usable IPv6 addresses without the knowledge or cooperation of any part of local network. The main security concerns raised by Teredo involves security controls being bypassed, defense in depth reduced, and unsolicited traffic being allowed by the protocol. Other security concerns with Teredo include the capability of remote nodes to open the NAT for themselves, worms, ways to deny Teredo service, the difficulty in finding all Teredo traffic to inspect, and a new phishing mechanism. | | Dr. James Hoagland, CISSP, is a Principal Security Researcher on the Advanced Threats Research team in Symantec Security Response.

While these worms have gotten more sophisticated and made use of additional technologies like Flash and media formats, they all have some basic limitations such as infecting new domains and injection methods. These worms are fairly easily detected using signatures and these limitations have made web worms annoying, but ultimately controllable. Often the source website simply fixes a single flaw and the worm dies.  In this presentation we will examine ways web worms might evolve to overcome these limitations. We describe a hybrid web worm combining both server-side and client side languages to exploit both the web server and the web browser to aid in its propagation across multiple hosts. We will discuss how such a hybrid worm is able to find new vulnerable systems and infect new hosts on different domains from both the client and the server. In addition will we look at how a hybrid worm could upgrade its infection methods while in the wild by fetching and parsing new web vulnerability information from public security sites, preventing a single silver bullet fix from stopping it. We will examine how web worms could implement polymorphism and source code mutation to evade signature detection systems. While these are not new concepts applying them to interpreted languages like Perl or JavaScript inside a browser allowed for some interesting twists and caused some challenges.  While we have not built a fully functioning hybrid worm, we will demo different parts of the worm in isolation to show how these features would function. Specifically we will look at how the worm could upgrade itself with publicly available vulnerability data as well as source code mutation. Based on methodology from the JavaScript vulnerability scanner Jikto, we will also demonstrate DOMinatrix, a JavaScript payload using SQL Injection to extract information from a website's database. Finally we will discuss steps to prevent hybrid web worms from exploiting a website or its users. | | Billy Hoffman is a lead security researcher for [SPI Dynamics.](http://www.spidynamics.com "SPI Dynamics") At SPI Dynamics, Billy focuses on automated discovery of Web application vulnerabilities and crawling technologies.

This process is difficult, time consuming, and expensive, but it doesn't need to be. Software programs can be made to reverse engineer themselves. Software, as a machine, can be understood by active observation, as opposed to static decompilation and prediction. In other words, you can reverse engineer software by using it, as opposed to reading code.  Code is nothing more than an abstraction of runtime states. When software operates it reverse engineers itself by design, exposing its conceptual abstraction to the CPU and memory. The problem is that computers only need to know about what the current state is, and because of that, they discard this veritable treasure trove of information. Observation of software behavior provides no less data than static reverse engineering, and in fact provides a great deal more information that is easier to understand and costs less to obtain. Human reverse engineers need tools and methods to capture and analyze this data.  Traditional debugging tools don‚t tie run-time information to abstract functionality because all this state information is too complex. But what the debugger doesn't see is precisely what the reverse engineer does see while running the program. The human mind grasps abstract functionality, the intent behind the seething mass of code and data. This is why automated program analysis can never replace the human mind.  Humans use software at a high layer of abstraction while the computer sees only the fine grains of detail. The challenge for the reverse engineer is to join the two extremes. Historically, this chasm between total abstraction and microscopic granularity has been bridged by static disassembly and this is the reason most people haven't tackled reverse engineering. In truth, most people who are daunted by this barrier could, in fact, be excellent reverse engineers. This is a terrible shame because there are many tools and techniques available for reverse engineering that do not, or at least, should not require reading disassembled instructions. And even though the tools can't go from fine grains to mountains automatically, proper usage can reveal the links between user action and execution under the hood.  This talk introduces a new method of reverse engineering coined 'Active' Reversing. Active Reversing includes debugging tools driven with techniques of use such as substring scanning, access breakpoints, dataflow tracing, behavioral set operations, run tracing, data sampling, proximity browsing, comparative memory scans, hit counters, and more. Some of the tools and techniques have been in use for quite some time, others are new concepts. In either case, never have all the techniques been formally presented as a new methodology. Active Reversing is a fresh new look on an old subject. | | Greg Hoglund has been a pioneer in the area of software security for ten years.

Few things have had their design stretched as far as the web; as such, I've been starting to take a look at some interesting aspects of the ""Web 2.0"" craze. Here's a few things I've been looking at:  Slirpie: VPN'ing into Protected Networks With Nothing But A Lured Web Browser. Part of the design of the web is that browsers are able to collect and render resources across security boundaries. This has a number of issues, but they've historically been mitigated with what's known as the Same Origin Policy, which attempts to restrict scripting and other forms of enhanced access to sites with the same name. But scripts are not acquired from names; they come from addresses. As RSnake of ha.ckers.org and Dan Boneh of Stanford University have pointed out, so-called ""DNS Rebinding"" attacks can break the link between the names that are trusted, and the addresses that are connected to, allowing an attacker to proxy connectivity from a client. I will demonstrate an extension of RSnake and Boneh's work, that grants full IP connectivity, by design, to any attacker who can lure a web browser to render his page.  I will also discuss how the existence of attacks such as Slirpie creates special requirements for anyone intending to design or deploy Web Single Sign On technologies. Slirpie falls to some of them, but slices through the rest handily.  p0wf: Passing Fingerprinting of Web Content Frameworks. Traditional OS fingerprinting has looked to identify the OS Kernel that one is communicating with, based on the idea that if one can identify the kernel, one can target daemons that tend to be associated with it. But the web has become almost an entirely separate OS layer of its own, and especially with AJAX and Web 2.0, new forms of RPC and marshalling are showing up faster than anyone can identify. p0wf intends to analyze these streams and determine just which frameworks are being exposed on what sites.  LudiVu: A number of web sites have resorted to mechanisms known as CAPTCHAs, which are intended to separate humans from automated submission scripts. For accessibility reasons, these CAPTCHAs need to be both visual and auditory. They are usually combined with a significant amount of noise, so as to make OCR and speech recognition impossible. I was in the process of porting last year's dotplot similarity analysis code to audio streams for non-security related purposes, when Zane Lackey of iSec Partners proposed using this to analyze CAPTCHAs. It turns out that, indeed, Audio CAPTCHAs exhibit significant self-similarity that visualizes well in dotplot form. This will probably be the first Black Hat talk to use WinAMP as an attack tool.  A number of other projects are also being worked on—I've been sending billions of packets for a reason, after all, and they haven't been coming from WinAMP :) There will be some updates on the analysis tools discussed during Black Ops 2006 as well. | | Dan Kaminsky is the Director of Penetration Testing for Seattle-based IOActive, where he is greatly enjoying having minions.

Dr. Neal Krawetz, Hacker Factor Solutions | | --- | | Digital cameras and video software have made it easier than ever to create high quality pictures and movies. Services such as MySpace, Google Video, and Flickr make it trivial to distribute pictures, and many are picked up by the mass media. However, there is a problem: how can you tell if a video or picture is showing something real? Is it computer generated or modified? In a world where pictures are more influencial than words, being able to distinguish fact from fiction in a systematic way becomes essential.

RTP is responsible for the actual voice/audio stream in VoIP networks; hence attacks against RTP are valid against the bulk VoIP installations in enterprise environments. Since signaling (H.323/SIP/SCCP) and media transfer (RTP) are handled by two separate protocols, injecting audio into a stream is often the most damaging attack against RTP. RTP is vulnerable to audio injection due to its lack of integrity protection and its wide tolerance of sequence information.  The presentation will demonstrate an easy to use GUI VoIP injection attack tool for RTP appropriately named RTPInject. The tool, with zero setup prerequisites, allows an attacker to inject arbitrary audio into an existing conversation involving at least one VoIP endpoint. RTPInject automatically detects RTP streams on the wire, enumerates the codecs in use, and displays this information to the user. The user can then select an audio file they wish to inject into the targeted RTP stream. The presentation will provide a walkthrough of the easy three step process: view, click, and inject. | | Zane Lackey is a Security Consultant with iSEC Partners, Inc, a strategic digital security organization.

Door Keys to Credit Cards. Mobile Phones to Trash Cans. Pets to People even! For some reason these devices have become the solution to every new problem, and we can't seem to get enough of them... | | Adam Laurie is a UK based freelance security consultant. He started in the computer industry in the late Seventies, working as a computer programmer on PDP-8 and other mini computers, and then on various Unix, Dos and CP/M based micro computers as they emerged in the Eighties. He quickly became interested in the underlying network and data protocols, and moved his attention to those areas and away from programming, starting a data conversion company which rapidly grew to become Europe's largest specialist in that field (A.L. Downloading Services). During this period, he successfully disproved the industry lie that music CDs could not be read by computers, and wrote the world's first CD ripper, 'CDGRAB'. At this point, he and his brother, Ben, became interested in the newly emerging concept of 'The Internet', and were involved in various early open source projects, the most well known of which is probably their own—'Apache-SSL'—which went on to become the de-facto standard secure web server. Since the late Nineties they have focused their attention on security, and have been the authors of various papers exposing flaws in Internet services and/or software, as well as pioneering the concept of re-using military data centres (housed in underground nuclear bunkers) as secure hosting facilities. Adam has been a senior member of staff at DEFCON since 1997, and also acted as a member of staff during the early years of the Black Hat Briefings.  More recently he has become interested in mobile device security, and was responsible for discovering many major Bluetooth security issues, and has also spoken on other wireless topics such as InfraRed and Magnetic Stripes. His current interest, RFID, has spawned another Open Source project, RFIDIOt, which is also bringing several security issues to the fore.

Actually, no one denies our right to privacy. However, in reality, this right is being eroded more and more as every minute passes. Some of this has to do with the war on terror, but much of it simply has to do with the fact that our online actions can and are being recorded in minute detail. In this presentation we describe some concrete dangers that arise out of this situation and show that the uncomfortable feeling we have when our privacy is compromised is the least of our problems. We also show that a full understanding of these concrete dangers is crucial for coming up with adequate privacy-preserving solutions.  Having argued that the erosion of our privacy is a real danger, we discuss solutions to preserving privacy online. Some of these solutions are merely technical, like anonymous web surfing, but solve only a small part of the problem. For example, anonymous web surfing does not help if a user has to authenticate herself in order to access an online service (consider the case of a newspaper or magazine that requires subscription, and sometimes even paid subscription). Furthermore, as we will show, simple solutions like pseudonyms do not actually solve the real problems. Fortunately, it is possible to use anonymous authentication. Despite the fact that this seems to be a contradiction in terms, it is actually possible to authenticate without revealing your identity. In this type of protocol, the only information learned by the authenticating server is that the user is authorized. In particular, the authenticating server learns nothing whatsoever about the identity of the specific user that now entered the system! Cryptographic solutions to this problem and exist and are often called "anonymous credentials". However, all known solutions are relatively complex and require non-standard asymmetric operations (i.e., operations that are not available on standard smartcards). Thus, the deployment of such solutions is complex. In this presentation, we present new solutions to this problem that are simple and can be implemented using standard smartcard technology (and even passwords, although this achieves a weaker security guarantee). We also suggest concrete applications where the use of this primitive is especially appropriate. | | Andrew Lindell is the Chief Cryptographer at Aladdin Knowledge Systems and an Assistant Professor at Bar-Ilan University in Israel.

Although a lot of research has been conducted into exploiting bugs in user mode code for privilege escalation within the operating system defined boundaries as well as what can be done if one has arbitrary supervisor access (typically related to modern rootkit work), not a great deal of research has been done on the interface between supervisor and non-supervisor, and potential routes from one to the other.  The biggest problem arises when trying to protect the kernel from itself—for example, under the IA32 architecture implementation of Windows, the distinction between user mode and kernel mode from the user mode perspective is easily enforced through hardware based protection. However, as the kernel is running as supervisor, how does the kernel make distinctions between what it should be accessing? This would be irrelevant if the supervisor was not exposed to interaction with supervisee; but that would defeat the purpose of having a kernel.  This presentation is focussed on Windows and the Intel Architecture, and will briefly outline the current supervisor boundaries provided. Different attack vectors, along with relevant examples, will be providedto demonstrate how to attack the supervisor from the perspective of the supervised. There will then be an outline of what possible architectures could be used to mitigate such attacks, such as the research operating system Singularity. | | Jonathan Lindsay is a security consultant for NGS Software. Though he has a wide range of experience in IT security, he specialises in reverse engineering and started his career as a virus researcher. The necessity of dealing with both user mode and kernel mode rootkits in the AV industry envouraged him to delve into the underlying operating system technologies concerned.  Some of Jonathan's primary interests are the application of reverse engineering to everything, automated static binary analysis, and prodding kernel code until it falls over. |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | Database Forensics**David Litchfield,** Founder, Next Generation Security Software | | --- | | Since the state of California passed the Database Security Breach Notification Act (SB 1386) in 2003 another 34 states have passed similar legislation with more set to follow.

Arguably, the two factors keeping the number of announced vulnerabilities on Mac OS X low is that not many researchers are interested in exploring this operating system due to low market share and not many researchers are familiar with the platform which can introduce a steep learning curve. The first of these reasons is going away as Apple’s market share continues to rise. This talk hopes to address the second reason. Namely, to provide researchers already familiar with Windows and Linux the knowledge and tools necessary to search for new security bugs in this operating system, specifically the new forthcoming release of “Leopard”, the newest version of Mac OS X. Happily, there are plenty of bugs and some Mac-only tools which help to find them.

Most of the highest-profile leakage news has about been stolen laptops (VA, CPS), or large-scale external compromises of customer databases (TJX).  On a less covered, but much more commonplace basis, sensitive financial data, company secrets, and customer information move in and out of networks and on and off of company systems all the time. Where it goes can be hard to pin down.  How can a company prevent (let alone detect) Alice taking a snapshot of the customer database or financial projections and posting them on internet forums or even dumping them to a floppy disk? This, understandably, has a lot of people worried.  In response, many organizations have begun looking for technologies to detect and prevent sensitive information from leaving their networks, servers, workstations, and even buildings. For some time a product space for "Extrusion Detection" products has existed. But now the space is exploding and as tends to happen, security problems abound.  Some "Extrusion Detections" products rely on network gateway IPS/IDS approaches, whereas others work in a way more closely resembling host-based IDS/IPS. The main difference is that instead of detecting/preventing malicious information from entering a company's perimeter, they focus on keeping assets \*inside\*.  We've been evaluating a number of products in this space and have run across a large number of vulnerabilities. They range from improper evidence handling, to inherent design issues, all the way to complete compromise of an enterprise, using the Extrusion Detection framework itself as the vehicle. | | Eric Monti is a computer security professional, developer, and researcher of over ten years industry experience.

These errors result from input variable values being used throughout the many areas and codebases that make up the application, and in doing so, are potentially treated as different data types throughout the processing. The application functions correctly and without issue because the values of the input variable are anticipated, even though they are treated in different areas as different data types. The issue arises then when a value is input into one of these variables that is crafted in such a way as to be successfully manipulated by some data types, while failing others, resulting in the application behaving in unanticipated and potentially dangerous ways. These vulnerabilities are much more difficult to identify than simple error-based SQL injection or XSS as they don't readily display success or failure, rather can manifest themselves in other areas or at a later time. This also makes them very dangerous in that the application behaves in completely unanticipated ways, potentially resulting in circumvented authentication and authorization, Denial of Service, elevated privileges, etc.  This talk explores the security pitfalls that result from type conversion errors, how to identify them, and proposes some solutions for identification going forward. |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | (un)Smashing the Stack: Overflows, Countermeasures, and the Real World Shawn Moyer, Chief Researcher, SpearTip Technologies | | --- | | As of today, Vista, XP, 2K03, OS X, every major Linux distro, and each of the BSD's either contain some facet of (stack|buffer|heap) protection, or have one available that's relatively trivial to implement/enable.  So, this should mean the end of memory corruption-based attacks as we know it, right? Sorry, thanks for playing.  The fact remains that many (though not all) implementations are incomplete at best, and at worst are simply bullet points in marketing documents that provide a false sense of safety.

Legal pressure forced the talk to be curtailed, with only 25% of the material being presented. The remainder was replaced with a Panel debate involving IOActive, US-CERT, ACLU, Blackhat, and Grand Idea Studio. After spending far too much time and money dealing with lawyers and consulting with some strategic allies, IOActive has made some relatively minor tweaks to the original presentation, which will be presented as the first part of this talk.  The second part of the talk introduces Cloner 2.0. The first Cloner was designed to be as simplistic as possible, and succeeded at the cost of read range, flexibility, and overall sophistication. Cloner 2.0 aims to address these concerns with a significantly enhanced read range, a "passive" mode to sniff the exchange between tags and legitimate readers, multi–tag storage capability, multiple RF frontends and an enhanced software backend to support many different type of Proximity tags, and overall improvements in reliability and flexibility.  While we won't be able to give you full schematics or the names of any vendors whose tags can be cloned, we will be including significant information (including useful snippets of source and circuit diagram fragments) that will allow you to more deeply understand the significant flaws in older RFID technologies. This talk will give you th information you need to make informed decisions about the use and mis-use of the most common RFID implementations available today.  Abstract for the original "RFID for Beginners" talk: RFID tags are becoming more and more prevalent. From access badges to implantable Verichips, RFID tags are finding more and more uses. Few people in the security world actually understand RFID though; the "radio" stuff gets in the way. This presentation aims to bridge that gap, by delivering sufficient information to design and build a working RFID cloner based around a single chip—the PIC16F628A. Assuming no initial knowledge of electronics, I'll explain everything you need to know in order to build a working cloner, understand how it works, and see exactly why RFID is so insecure and untrustworthy. Covering everything from Magnetic Fields to Manchester Encoding, this presentation is suitable for anyone who is considering implementing an RFID system, considering hacking an RFID system, or who just wants to know a little more about the inductively coupled, ASK modulated, backscattering system known as RFID. | | Chris Paget is the Director of Research and Development for IOActive (based in Seattle) and is currently creating IOActive's East-Coast research and auditing facility.

These tools are expected to perform a large range of dangerous functions, such as parsing dozens of different file systems, email databases and dense binary file formats. Although the software we tested is considered a critical part of the investigatory cycle in the criminal and civil legal worlds, our testing demonstrated important security flaws within only minutes of fault injection.  In this talk, we will present our findings from applying several software exploitation techniques to leading commercial and open-source forensics packages. We will release several new file and file system fuzzing tools that were created in support of this research, as well as demonstrate how to use the tools to create your own malicious hard drives and files.  This talk will make the following arguments:   1. Forensic software vendors are not paranoid enough. Vendors must operate under the assumption that their software is under concerted attack.- Vendors do not take advantage of the protections for native code that platforms provide, such as stack overflow protection, memory page protection), safe exception handling, etc.- Forensic software customers use insufficient acceptance criteria when evaluating software packages. Criteria typically address only functional correctness during evidence acquisition when no attacker is present, yet forensic investigations are adversarial.- Methods for testing the quality of forensic software are not meaningful, public, or generally adopted. Our intention is to expose the security community to the techniques and importance of testing forensics software, and to push for a greater cooperation between the customers of forensics software to raise the security standard to which such software is held. | | Chris Palmer is a security consultant with iSEC Partners, performing application penetration tests, code reviews, and security research.

Worse, imagine all someone had to do to own you was to inject some html that runs a plugin or some clever javascript to bypass your proxy settings. Unfortunately, this is the risk faced by many users of the Tor anonymity network who use the default configurations of many popular browsers and other network software. Tor is designed to make it difficult even for adversaries that control several points in the network to determine where you're coming from or where you're going, yet these "data anonymity" attacks and attacks to bypass Tor can be performed effectively by a malicious website, or just one guy with a Ruby interpreter! To add insult to injury, software vendors seldom consider such exploits and other privacy leaks as real vulnerabilities.  Fortunately, there are some things that can be done to improve the security of the web browser and Tor users in general. This talk will discuss various approaches to securing the Tor network and Tor usage against a whole gauntlet of attacks, from browser specific, to general intersection risks, to theoretical attacks on routing itself. Methods of protection discussed will include node scanning, transparent Tor gateways, Firefox extensions (including the dark arts of Javascript hooking), and general user education. Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses, which will be discussed in detail. | | Mike Perry By day, Mike Perry is a mild mannered reverse engineer owned and operated by Riverbed Technology, slaving away at accelerating broken monopolistic protocols from the Evil Empire and generally helping to make the Internet faster by several orders of magnitude.

As the market is still evolving and one framework has been quite successful on the market: "Cisco Network Admission Control". NAC is a pivotal part of Cisco’s "Self Defending Network" strategy and supported on the complete range of Cisco network- and security-products. From a security point of view “NAC” is a very interesting emerging technology which deservers some scrutiny. We are able to hack the Cisco NAC-solution by exploiting a fundamental design flaw.  Part II: NAC Technology—How it works: The basic idea behind Cisco NAC is quite simple: Before allowing a client admittance to the network the client is tested against a predefined set of “policies”. These tests are performed by a backend system (a Cisco ACS) which processes .credentials supplied by the client against one or more administrator-defined policies. Based on the result of these tests a client is categorized and a well-defined access-level to the network is granted. While the client is connected to the network it is repeatedly rechecked and the state of the client is reassessed. On a somewhat more technical layer the communication takes place using EAP over UDP with undisclosed Cisco-proprietary EAP messages and the UDP connection itself is secured using SSL. The connection-point to the network (e.g. the switch, wireless AP, Firewall, Router, etc.) acts sort of as a "translating proxy" between the client talking EAPoU and the Cisco Secure ACS server talking RADIUS [Client <-EAPoU-> Switch <-RADIUS-> ACS). Besides this "proxy"-functionality the connection-point also acts as an enforcing element of the security policy. Three somewhat different deployment flavours of Cisco NAC exist but the underlying concept “admittance-level based on the result of a test” is always the same.  For every .NAC-enabled application on the client a client-side agent provides so called “credentials” to the ACS server where they are compared against the defined tests to derive a “posture token” per application. From all application posture tokens an overall “system posture token” is inferred which determines the access-level granted to the client. The client-side agent of the framework responsible for the communication is the “Cisco Trust Agent” (CTA) which also includes the capability to report a few basic credentials (e.g. OS Version, Hostname, etc) without an additional NAC-enabled application. The CTA contains an API enabling third-party vendors to hook their applications into the NAC framework. Anti-Virus Vendors have been among the first to join the NAC-Alliance formed by Cisco.  Part III: The Problem—NAC is not “secure by design”: The Cisco NAC solution contains at least one major design-flaw which enables us to hack (at least) two of the three different variants: The server authenticates itself to the client using a server-certificate and client and server establish a secure tunnel (something like “SSL over UDP”), but the client does not authenticate itself to the server, so we have a situation in which a component (the client) is authorized without prior authentication. After realizing this fundamental design-error, the idea of a “posture spoofing attack” was born and research started with evaluating different attack-vectors for their feasibility. In the end we decided to analyse the protocols used within the framework and code our own “NAC-client” which provides the ACS with attacker-supplied-credentials in order to get illegitimate access to NAC-secured networks.  Part IV: The Hack—how we did it NAC is a complex system involving different protocols which are used in an odd combination. Especially the usage of SSL over UDP/EAP-FAST over UDP made the usage of SSL-Proxies for man-in-the-middle attacks or clear-text-traffic-analysis with standard methods impossible. So instead of focusing on the network-traffic (which was our first approach—“stare at the packets until you understand them”), we decided to focus on the client first. Analysing the CTA client in different versions and on different operating systems revealed some of the inner workings of the protocols. Besides “Client analysis” we built a NAC test-lab and developed a “NAC-test-suite” to implement different “admission-scenarios”. While running theses tests we hooked into the interesting functions of the client in order to understand the functions used and their (inter)dependencies. As a next step we started coding our own NAC client to get a better insight into the communication process. The first goal was to get a clear text dump of the communication by establishing the secure tunnel. The next goal was to provide our own credentials to the ACS in order to get access to the NAC protected network. We will release our "NAC-Credential-Spoofing"-tool at the conference alongside with our insight into the operating of NAC.  Part V: Our proposed talk We do not wish to simply release a tool; we want the audience to understand how Cisco NAC works, why it is not as secure as Cisco wants us to believe and which mitigations exist, if NAC is implemented (there actually exist mitigations and secure setup-approaches). We will present our approach, disclose technical details yet unpublished and release our tool. As an “add-on”-benefit we will explain how to tackle a complex system like NAC when doing security research. | | Dror-John Roecher has enjoyed working with Cisco stuff for more than eight years and is usually busy assessing the security of enterprise networks and data-centers.

Joanna Rutkowska, Invisible Things Lab Alexander Tereshkin, Invisible Things Lab | | --- | | We will present new, practical methods for compromising Vista x64 kernel on the fly and discuss the irrelevance of TPM/Bitlocker technology in protecting against such non-persistent attacks. Then we will briefly discuss kernel infections of the type II (pure data patching), especially NDIS subversions that allow for generic bypassing of personal firewalls on Vista systems.  A significant amount of time will be devoted to presenting new details about virtualization-based malware. This will include presenting various detection methods that could be used to either detect the presence of a hypervisor or find the malware itself. We will also discuss why each of these approaches cannot be used to build a practical detector, either because they could be fully defeated by virtualization based malware or because they are very impractical. This will include demonstration of how virtualization based malware can avoid timing-based detection, even if a detector uses trusted time source. We will also discuss detection approaches based on exploiting CPU bugs. The conclusion of this part is that we still do not have any good way to detect virtualization based malware...  We’re also going to talk about malware that fully supports nested virtualization (like e.g. our New Blue Pill does) and how this might be a challenge for OSes that would like to provide their own hypervisors in order to prevent Blue Pill-like attacks.  People say that once an attacker gets into the kernel, the game is over and we should reinstall the whole system from scratch. In this presentation we show that sometimes we cannot know that the game is actually over, so we do not even know when to stop trusting our systems.

Yet the typical DNS cache poisoning approach, aimed at various levels in the DNS server hierarchy or the enterprise server itself, is not as effective as it could be, primarily because so many people are affected that detection is rapid...  There is one approach to DNS cache poisoning that can control the attack surface and is particularly effective when executed from within the enterprise. Rather than attempting to poison the enterprise DNS server or other external caches, the internal DNS cache within a Windows PC is targeted. Additionally, forensic analysis of the infected PC is hindered by the TimeToLive and volatility of these cache entries.  I will demonstrate this type of attack using two machines on a local lan, and include some analysis of the firewall and configuration issues needed to defend against this type of exploit. | | Jerry Schneider has enjoyed groveling inside all types of system software, reversing code to illuminate its undocumented features and hacking behaviors to his liking.

Unfortunately, far too many people rush into Ajax development without giving proper consideration to security issues. These unfortunate individuals suffer from the most embarrassing of security issues: Premature Ajax-ulation.  This presentation will demonstrate specific Ajax application design flaws that stem from a disregard for security, including: Improper use of client-side XSLT; Use of overly- or underly-granular server-side APIs; and Storing secrets (either data or functionality) in client-side code.  We will also perform live demonstrations of exploits of these vulnerabilities, including: Vastly more efficient Blind SQL and Blind XPath injection techniques; Detecting and exploiting race conditions; and Applying static analysis to deobfuscate client-side JavaScript.  Given the popularity of Ajax and the ease of use of framework helper libraries, it can be very tempting for developers to use Ajax when it's not really necessary. This is a significant security risk in itself, since Ajax applications can be more difficult to secure than traditional Web applications. Furthermore, the use of third-party frameworks can actually make the problem worse, since they hide potential security issues without truly resolving them. We will address these issues, make recommendations on which Ajax frameworks to avoid, and make recommendations on when to avoid Ajax altogether.

One must remember though that the value of data is often only as good as the analysis technique used.  In this presentation, we will describe a number of alternative analysis techniqes that leverages techniques adopted from statistics, AI, data mining, graphics design pattern recognition and economics. We will also show how security researchers can utilize tools from other disciplines to extract valuable findings to support security research work.  This presentation hopes to be an eye opener for security practitioners that there are many more techniques, tools and options beyond the security research field that they can use in their work. Hopefully, this will be the groundwork for a cross-discipline collaborative project that will help identify more techniques for security research and analysis.  Some techniques that we will talk about is the use of various clustering algorithms to classify attacks. Predicting attacks by using learning algorithms, detecting attacks through artificial intelligence, determining attack trends using pattern recognition and advanced visualization for attack analysis.  Among the tools that we will demonstrate are readily available open source tools like WEKA, Tanagra, and R Project that have not been traditionally used in security research but has great potential in security research.

Generally, desktop users tend to have a fairly small number of programs that are used on an almost constant basis—web browsers, Instant Messengers, e-mail readers and media players. Of those, media players have been underexplored as an attack vector. There have been simple overflow exploits of long playlists, filenames or HTTP responses, but very little has been done that is specific to media streams themselves.  Audio in particular is an attractive attack vector because:   * Players are very frequently used software; users tend to use them for an extended period of time, leaving them open during other tasks, and frequently switch media streams.* There are a wide variety of different audio players, and many of different codecs and audio file plugins—all written by generally non-security-conscious people.* The file formats involved are binary streams, and tend to be reasonably complex.* Players take untrusted input from many different unreliable sources (often over the network), and run with fairly high privilege and priority. For instance, in Windows Vista, a low-privileged IE instance can launch content in a higher-privileged WMP.* They're perceived as relatively harmless—users are likely to play files given to them.* They're frequently invoked without the user's explicit acknowledgement, (i.e. embedded in a webpage)* Media content is rich in metadata and external references. Media players behave more like web browsers every day.   The examples in this presentation will illustrate some of the techniques used to build a basic media codec fuzzer in Python, using a new (free, open-source) tool, Fuzzbox, as an example. Also included will be a review of some of the more interesting new bugs this tool has disclosed in audio players and libraries.  While the focus is on audio codecs in this presentation, some of the container formats involved also can contain other content like video, and the techniques involved are readily applicable to codecs of all kinds. | | David Thiel is a Security Consultant with iSEC Partners, Inc, a strategic digital security organization.

CoreLabs devised an attack that works without requiring the existence of implementation bugs or security misconfigurations in the database. The new attack relies solely on the inherent characteristics of the indexing algorithms used by most commercial database management systems.  During this talk, Damian Saura and Ariel Waissbein will present ongoing research work on this new type of attack against database-driven applications. Their work uses timing attacks, a common technique for breaking cipher system implementations, and applies them to database engines. The researchers will explain how this technique makes it possible to extract private data from a database by performing record insertion operations, which are typically available to all database users – including anonymous users of front-end web applications.  The presentation will also review BTREE, the most popular database indexing algorithm and data structure. Saura and Wassbein will describe how they discovered BTREE’s security weaknesses and demonstrate the attack against the MySQL database engine. | | Ariel Waissbein has been a researcher at Core Security Technologies for the last 8 years, producing results relevant to industry and academy.

So unless there is a process to detect backdoors they will inevitably be inserted into software. Requiring source code is a hurdle to detecting backdoors since it isn't typically available for off the shelf software or for many of the libraries developers link to. And what about your developer tool chain? Ken Thompson in "Reflections on Trusting Trust" showed your compiler can't be trusted. What about your linker, obfuscator or packer? To find backdoors in these scenarios you need to inspect the software executable binary.  We will present techniques for inspecting binaries for backdoors. We will discuss the different backdoor approaches that have been discovered in the wild and hypothesize other approaches that are likely to be used. We will give examples of how the backdoors present themselves in the binary and how to find them. | | Chris Wysopal is co-founder and CTO of Veracode, which provides an on-demand software security analysis service.

In some cases, the reverser needs to know the internals of the operating system in order to identify or solve very difficult anti-reversing tricks employed by packers/protectors, patience and cleverness are also major factors in a successful unpack. This challenge involves researchers creating the packers and on the other side, the researchers that are determined to bypass these protections.  The main purpose of this paper is to present anti-reversing techniques employed by executable packers/protectors and also discusses techniques and publicly available tools that can be used to bypass or disable this protections. This information will allow researchers, especially, malcode analysts to identify these techniques when utilized by packed malicious code, and then be able decide the next move when these anti-reversing techniques impedes successful analysis. As a secondary purpose, the information presented can also be used by researchers that are planning to add some level of protection in their software by slowing down reversers from analyzing their protected code, but of course, nothing will stop an skilled, informed, and determined reverser. | | Mark Vincent Yason is a malcode analyst.

His track record includes hundreds of published articles, dozens of published short stories, one published book with more coming, several thousand speeches, and—in a former incarnation - hundreds of sermons, all original, all unique.  In the nineteen eighties, Thieme began writing about the impact of new technologies on religious systems and images, on spirituality, on identity. He was an Episcopal priest, and it made sense to begin where he was. What he wrote sounds obvious now. But it didn't, then.  He realized that his insights applied to other aspects of society and culture too. What was happening to religions was happening to everything else, a sea change of global transformation driven by new technologies of information and communication.
