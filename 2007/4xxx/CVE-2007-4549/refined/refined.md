```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
    - Stack-based buffer overflow: Occurs when decrypting an overly long file-key from a specially crafted APW file into a fixed-size stack buffer.
    - Format-string vulnerability: Occurs due to the insecure use of `sprintf()` when handling folder names read from an APW file.
    - Heap buffer overflow: Occurs when decrypting ciphertext into a smaller buffer allocated on the heap, due to inconsistent length checks.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Stack-based buffer overflow
    - Format string vulnerability
    - Heap-based buffer overflow
    - Insufficient input validation
- Impact of exploitation:
    - Arbitrary code execution (stack-based overflow)
    - Application crash (format string and heap overflow)
- Attack vectors:
    - By importing a specially crafted APW file containing a malicious file-key, folder name, or ciphertext
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Requires user interaction to import a malicious APW file.
    - Ability to create or modify an APW file.
