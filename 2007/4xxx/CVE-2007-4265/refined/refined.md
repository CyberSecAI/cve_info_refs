- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Input passed to multiple parameters ("projectIssueId", "projectId", "folderId", "sortField") in various .do files is not properly sanitized before being returned to the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary HTML and script code can be executed in a user's browser session in the context of the affected site.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious code into the vulnerable parameters via HTTP requests to the web application
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the web application.
