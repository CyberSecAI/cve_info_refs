Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `com_simplefaq` component of Mambo. Specifically, the `aid` parameter is not validated, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  - SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `aid` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  -  Database compromise: An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**
  -  HTTP GET request: The attack is performed via a specially crafted URL request to the vulnerable `index.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable Mambo instance. No prior authentication is required.
  - The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable Mambo component.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit string demonstrates the vulnerability:
```
http://localhost/mambo/index.php?option=com_simplefaq&task=answer&Itemid=9999&catid=9999&aid=-1/**/union/**/select/**/0,username,password,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0/**/from/**/mos_users/*
```
This URL exploits the `aid` parameter with a SQL injection payload using `UNION SELECT` to extract `username` and `password` fields from the `mos_users` table.

This information is more detailed than the typical description provided for the CVE and the exploit string is included.
