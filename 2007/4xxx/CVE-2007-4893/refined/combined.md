# WordPress 2.2.3

---

2.2.3 is a security and bug-fix release for the 2.2 series. Since this is a security release, we suggest you upgrade immediately. Two of the fixes are high priority.

On our Trac you can see the [bugs closed](https://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=2.2.3) and the [files changed](https://trac.wordpress.org/changeset?old_path=tags%2F2.2.2&old=6063&new_path=tags%2F2.2.3&new=6063) for 2.2.3.

To get 2.2.3, please see [our download page](https://wordpress.org/download/).

As always, [upgrade instructions](https://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress) including an [extended upgrade guide](https://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress_Extended) are available.

Thanks to Alexendar Concha, Aaron Newman, and xknown for identifying and helping us fix the security vulnerabilities.

The attached file is a proposed fix for 2.2 branch, I hope this ticket gets more attention now.

I can't reproduce on WP 2.2.2. Can you provide exact steps to reproduce this? Are you sure this happens on a fresh installation of WordPress? Perhaps a plugin is causing this?

Trunk is definitely not vulnerable, as grepping the source tree doesn't return anything for a search of 'no\_filter'.

Trunk is vulnerable - search for $no\_filter for more info.

Try the following [​bookmarklet](http://pastebin.com/m4c0fb5c3) on wp-admin/post-new.php, it should work on WP 2.2.x

### [#7](#comment:7) [@Otto42](https://profiles.wordpress.org/otto42) [17 years](/timeline?from=2007-08-14T20%3A41%3A22Z&precision=second "See timeline at 08/14/2007 08:41:22 PM") ago

* **Milestone**
  *2.2.3* deleted
* **Resolution**
  set to *invalid*
* **Status**
  changed from *new* to *closed*

I just checked out a fresh copy of trunk from svn and the text "no\_filter" does not appear anywhere in it whatsoever. grep -i -r no\_filter \* returned no results.

This has got to be a problem with a plugin or something. Even if no\_filter is set and even if you have register\_globals on to turn it into $no\_filter, there's no check for $no\_filter anywhere in the code.

Marked as invalid.

### [#8](#comment:8) [@Otto42](https://profiles.wordpress.org/otto42) [17 years](/timeline?from=2007-08-14T20%3A43%3A57Z&precision=second "See timeline at 08/14/2007 08:43:57 PM") ago

* **Version**
  *2.2.2* deleted

### [#9](#comment:9) [@westi](https://profiles.wordpress.org/westi) [17 years](/timeline?from=2007-08-14T20%3A49%3A34Z&precision=second "See timeline at 08/14/2007 08:49:34 PM") ago

* **Milestone**
  set to *2.2.3*
* **Resolution**
  *invalid* deleted
* **Status**
  changed from *closed* to *reopened*
* **Version**
  set to *2.2.2*

This is fixed on trunk.

But 2.2 has the no\_filter code still it was removed for 2.3 in the changes for [#4620](/ticket/4620 "#4620: defect (bug): Post status transition actions (closed: fixed)") I think.

### [#10](#comment:10) [@Otto42](https://profiles.wordpress.org/otto42) [17 years](/timeline?from=2007-08-15T16%3A47%3A19Z&precision=second "See timeline at 08/15/2007 04:47:19 PM") ago

Okay, I see the $no\_filter in wp-includes/post.php, however I still fail to see how this would be expected to work. Nothing sets $no\_filter anywhere. You might be able to set it if you had register\_globals on (which no sane host has), however wp\_unregister\_GLOBALS() should unset $no\_filter even in that case, when wp-settings.php gets included.

I see no possible way that this can actually work, even with 2.2.2. What am I missing here?

### [#11](#comment:11) [@Otto42](https://profiles.wordpress.org/otto42) [17 years](/timeline?from=2007-08-15T16%3A49%3A55Z&precision=second "See timeline at 08/15/2007 04:49:55 PM") ago

Question to xknown (original submitter): Have you actually done this and made it work? Can you provide exact reproduction details? Or is this a purely theoretical thing you found while looking through the code?

Because I just tried it with a local install of 2.2.2 and was unable to reproduce it.

### [#12](#comment:12) [@Otto42](https://profiles.wordpress.org/otto42) [17 years](/timeline?from=2007-08-15T16%3A55%3A53Z&precision=second "See timeline at 08/15/2007 04:55:53 PM") ago

Edit: AH HA! Okay, it only works when you use POST parameters. It will not work with GET parameters. register\_globals is not required.

The problem is this line in admin-functions.php:

$post\_ID = wp\_insert\_post( $\_POST );

That's unsafe, you're passing $\_POST directly to wp\_insert\_post, which then goes on to do an extract() on the variable, setting any local function variables you like.

The $\_POST should be filtered for valid parameters in some fashion before passing it off to wp\_insert\_post().

xknown's patch looks like it will suffice for 2.2. 2.3 has already removed no\_filter.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=285831#c0)  Alexander Koenig    2007-09-11 12:30:03 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Yet again, new WordPress security issues have been detected. The developers have released a new version 2.2.3 that addresses these issues: <http://wordpress.org/development/2007/09/wordpress-223/>  According to the announcement "Two of the fixes are high priority." I could not find any related CVEs.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  wordpress-2.2.2-0.fc7   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=285831#c1)  Adrian Reber    2007-09-11 12:55:51 UTC  ``` John,  if you are interested I could co-maintain to fix such bugs. Because we have wordpress running on our system and I have good contacts to Alex who seems to know  always when a new security release is available.  So let me know if it would be okay for you.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=285831#c2)  John Berninger    2007-09-11 14:20:26 UTC  ``` Adrian - co-maintainership is fine by me - in fact, it'd be a good thing, since I've been wandering away from wordpress in the new job.     ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=285831#c3)  Adrian Reber    2007-09-11 14:31:47 UTC  ``` I will then update the devel, FC7 and FC6 branch later today if that is possible. I am a bit lost what the status right now is with ACLs... But I will just try to update the branches and request a build.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=285831#c4)  Fedora Update System    2007-09-12 16:44:53 UTC  ``` wordpress-2.2.3-0.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
