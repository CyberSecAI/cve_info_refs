{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `wp_insert_post` function in WordPress 2.2.2 and earlier versions directly used the `$_POST` array without proper filtering. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML by adding a `no_filter` field to the POST data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Direct use of unfiltered user input"
    ],
    "impact": "Users without the `unfiltered_html` capability could post arbitrary HTML, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, privilege escalation, and other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Tampering with POST data sent to `post.php` or `page.php`"
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to modify the POST request before it's sent to the server. This could be achieved through a malicious browser extension, a man-in-the-middle attack, or by directly crafting the request."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "WordPress 2.2.2 and earlier versions"
  ],
  "fixes": [
    "WordPress 2.2.3 fixed this vulnerability by ensuring that the `no_filter` parameter is unset before it is passed to `wp_insert_post`. This prevents the injection of arbitrary HTML. The code change was introduced in revision 6018"
