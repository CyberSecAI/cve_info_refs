  "CVE-2007-4730": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the way X.Org's composite extension handles 32-bit color depth windows while running in 16 bit color depth mode. If an X.org server has enabled the composite extension, it may be possible for a malicious authorized client to cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the X.org server.",
    "Root cause": "A buffer overflow error exists in the compNewPixmap() function within the composite extension when copying the contents of pixmaps, specifically when copying from a large pixel depth pixmap to a smaller pixel depth pixmap.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution as the user running the X server, typically root.  A denial of service is also possible.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access via the Composite Extension of the X Server",
      "An authenticated user may resize a window."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "A local attacker with the ability to connect to the X server and use the Composite extension.  It is triggered by resizing windows with different bit-depths.",
     "Additional Details": "The vulnerability occurs due to incorrect calculation of buffer sizes during pixmap copying between different bit depths. The fix involves using the Composite extension's capabilities when the source and destination pixmaps have different depths."
