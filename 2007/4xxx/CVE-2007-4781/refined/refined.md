    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'filter' parameter before using it in an SQL query.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In this specific case, the exploit code targets retrieval of user credentials (username and password hash).",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/index.php?option=com_content&view=archive` endpoint with a malicious SQL query in the 'filter' parameter.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable Joomla! instance. No prior authentication is required for the described SQL injection."
