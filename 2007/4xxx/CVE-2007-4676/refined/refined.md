Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4676:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of malformed elements during the parsing of PICT images by Apple QuickTime. Specifically, it involves:
    *   **PackBitsRgn field (Opcode 0x0099):**  Improper handling of a malformed element in this structure leads to heap corruption.
    *   **Poly type opcodes (0x0070-74):** Improper handling of a malformed element in these structures also leads to heap corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** A stack buffer overflow exists in the PICT image processing within Apple QuickTime.
*   **Heap Corruption:** Due to improper handling of malformed elements in the specified opcodes, heap corruption occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected system, running under the user's credentials.
*   **Application Termination/Crash:** An attacker can cause the QuickTime application to terminate unexpectedly or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PICT Images:** The attack vector involves enticing a user to open a specially crafted malicious PICT image.
*   **Web Pages:** Malicious PICT images could be hosted on a web page and the user could be tricked into visiting it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafting Malicious Images:** The attacker needs the ability to craft malformed PICT images to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:**  Exploitation requires user interaction in the form of opening the malicious PICT file or visiting a web page hosting it.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attack can be carried out by a remote, unauthenticated attacker.
