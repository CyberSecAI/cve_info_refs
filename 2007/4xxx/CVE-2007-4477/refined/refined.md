Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Planet VC-200M VDSL2 router's built-in HTTP server has a flaw that prevents remote administration if the HTTP request doesn't include a "Host:" header.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the HTTP server's failure to properly handle requests lacking a "Host:" header. This indicates a weakness in the server's implementation or input validation, which is failing to process the request correctly.

**Impact of exploitation:** The impact is that remote administration of the router is impossible if the attacker's request does not include a “Host:” header. This implies that without the "Host:" header, the router's web interface, and thus remote management, becomes inaccessible.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via HTTP requests. An attacker could simply send an HTTP request without the required "Host:" header to deny access to the remote admin interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router, implying they have network access to the router's web interface, and does not need any prior authentication or information.
