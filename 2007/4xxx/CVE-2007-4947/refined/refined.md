Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of a variable `$ptinclude` in `include()` statements without proper sanitization or validation in multiple files. The script automatically searches for files that include a path concatenated with "/pt_config.inc".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. The `$ptinclude` variable, if not properly set, can be manipulated to include a remote file by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application by including a malicious remote file. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated `$ptinclude` Variable:** The attacker can manipulate the `$ptinclude` variable, likely through a URL parameter or other input mechanisms, to point to a malicious file hosted on an attacker-controlled server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to identify the parameter(s) that can be used to manipulate the `$ptinclude` variable.

**Affected Files:**

*   `tmp/myphpPagetool-0.4.3.ta/myphpPagetool/doc/admin/index.php`
*   `tmp/myphpPagetool-0.4.3.ta/myphpPagetool/doc/admin/help1.php`
*   `tmp/myphpPagetool-0.4.3.ta/myphpPagetool/doc/admin/help2.php`
*   `tmp/myphpPagetool-0.4.3.ta/myphpPagetool/doc/admin/help3.php`
*   `tmp/myphpPagetool-0.4.3.ta/myphpPagetool/doc/admin/help4.php`
*   `tmp/myphpPagetool-0.4.3.ta/myphpPagetool/doc/admin/help5.php`
*  `tmp/myphpPagetool-0.4.3.ta/myphpPagetool/doc/admin/help6.php`
*  `tmp/myphpPagetool-0.4.3.ta/myphpPagetool/doc/admin/help7.php`
*  `tmp/myphpPagetool-0.4.3.ta/myphpPagetool/doc/admin/help8.php`
*  `tmp/myphpPagetool-0.4.3.ta/myphpPagetool/doc/admin/help9.php`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content indicates that this vulnerability was found automatically by a script.
*   The script that found the vulnerability is in an early stage and the findings are not rechecked
*   The identified files use an `include` statement, making them susceptible to Remote File Inclusion.
