Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is a lack of proper input sanitization in the KwsPHP application, specifically in multiple modules. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This leads to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, three separate vulnerabilities are identified:

1.  **Stats module:** The `typenav` parameter in `index.php` within the stats module is vulnerable.
2.  **Member Space module:** The `id` parameter within the Member Space module is vulnerable.
3.  **Login module:** The `pseudo` parameter in `login.php` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities in multiple modules of the KwsPHP application.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Magic Quotes GPC:** The exploits explicitly mention that `magic_quotes_gpc` must be OFF for the exploits to work. This suggests that the application relies on this deprecated feature to mitigate SQL injection, rather than implementing proper input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive data from the database by crafting malicious SQL queries.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms by injecting SQL code to retrieve user credentials. In these examples, the exploits demonstrate how to extract usernames and passwords from the database.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection can enable attackers to modify or delete data and potentially gain control of the application or underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET/POST Requests:** The attack vectors involve sending specially crafted HTTP GET or POST requests to the vulnerable pages (`index.php` in the stats module, `index.php` with the member space module, and `login.php` for the login module).
*   **Malicious SQL Queries:** The attacker crafts malicious SQL queries, which are injected through vulnerable parameters such as `typenav` (stats), `id` (member space), and `pseudo` (login).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities remotely over the network.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to identify and understand the vulnerable parameters (`typenav`, `id`, `pseudo`) and the structure of the application's requests.
*   **Ability to Craft SQL Queries:** The attacker requires the ability to craft malicious SQL queries to extract sensitive data.
*   **magic_quotes_gpc Disabled:** The server needs to have the `magic_quotes_gpc` setting disabled.

**Additional details:**

*   The exploits provide proof of concept code using Perl.
*   The exploit code demonstrates the extraction of usernames and passwords via SQL injection.
*   The `stats` module exploit extracts credentials via a union-based SQL injection in the `typenav` parameter.
*   The `member_space` module exploits a similar union-based SQL injection vulnerability through the `id` parameter.
*    The `login.php` exploit uses a union-based SQL injection in the `pseudo` parameter.

This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, which would usually just state that the application is vulnerable to SQL injection and the potential impact.
