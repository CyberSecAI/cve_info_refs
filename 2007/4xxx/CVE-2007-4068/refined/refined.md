- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `kat_id` and `id` parameters within the `download` and `duyurular_detay` pages respectively.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability in the `kat_id` and `id` parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords from the `admin` and `superadmin` tables.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the `kat_id` and `id` parameters in the URL, an attacker can inject malicious SQL queries. The vulnerable pages are `download` and `duyurular_detay`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific privileges on the server are needed. The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameters and inject the SQL code.
