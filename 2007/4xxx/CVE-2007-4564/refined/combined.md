How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Problem about Illegal Granting of Group Permissions in Cosminexus Application Server

* [Vulnerability ID](#id)
* [Vulnerability description](#vuln)
* [Affected products](#product)
* [Fixed products](#action)
* [Revision history](#history)

Update: March 7, 2011

When a logical J2EE server or a logical user server is started from Cosminexus Manager in Cosminexus Application Server,
sometimes the group permissions of another user are granted to the activated server process.
As a result, the process might be able to access files and directories illegally.

## Vulnerability ID

HS07-025

## Vulnerability description

When either of the following logical servers are started from Cosminexus Manager in Cosminexus Application Server, sometimes the group permissions of another user are granted to the activated server process:

Logical J2EE server
The above problem occurs if the Component Container administrator has been registered and the logical J2EE server process is started from the management server. For logical J2EE servers, the affected Cosminexus versions are 06-50 and later.
Logical user server
The above problem occurs if user-id tags and group-id tags have been set in the user server definition file,
and the logical user server process is started from the management server.
For logical user servers, the affected Cosminexus versions are 07-00 and later.
