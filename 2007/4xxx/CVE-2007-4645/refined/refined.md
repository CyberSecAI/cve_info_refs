Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4645:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `index.php` file of NMDeluxe 2.0.0.
- The code directly uses user-supplied input from the `id` parameter in the `$_GET` array within a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The code fails to sanitize the `id` parameter before including it in the SQL query. Specifically, the `addslashes()` function is used, which is insufficient to prevent SQL injection.
- Insufficient input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Extraction:** An attacker can use a crafted `id` parameter to inject arbitrary SQL code and extract sensitive data from the database, as demonstrated in the provided exploit example where user credentials are retrieved by injecting a `UNION SELECT` query.
- Potential for full database compromise if the underlying MySQL user used in the app has sufficient privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a specific value for the `do` and `id` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- Basic knowledge of SQL and web application vulnerabilities.
