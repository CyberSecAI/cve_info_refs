Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2007-4417:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an improper privilege revocation mechanism within IBM DB2 UDB. Specifically, after revoking privileges on a method, a user may still be able to execute the method. This occurs because the routine authorization cache isn't immediately updated upon revocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Privilege Revocation:** The core weakness is the failure to immediately revoke access to methods after privileges are rescinded.
- **Authorization Cache Inconsistency:** The routine authorization cache retains old permissions until a cache flush is triggered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Method Execution:** An attacker can execute a method even after their privileges have been revoked, until the routine auth cache is cleared. This could potentially allow for continued access to sensitive functionality or data.
- The impact is further described as "the user may still be able to execute a method even if the privileges for the method has been revoked"

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Authenticated Users:** The attacker needs to be a remote user who is authenticated to the DB2 instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have had prior privileges to a method on the system.
- The attacker must maintain an active session during revocation of the associated privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The vulnerability exists in IBM DB2 UDB version 8 before Fixpak 15 and version 9.1 before Fixpak 3.
-   The provided text suggests that while a cache flush would solve this issue, it may be too disruptive of an action to perform frequently.
-   There is some inconsistency regarding whether the issue is present in both v8 and v9.1, with one source suggesting it is only in v8. However, IBM's documentation lists the fix for both versions.
