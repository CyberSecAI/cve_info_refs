Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-4656:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `backup-manager-upload` script in Backup Manager passed the FTP server hostname, username, and password as plaintext command-line arguments during FTP uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  Sensitive FTP credentials (hostname, username, and password) were exposed in the command-line arguments. This is a classic example of insecure handling of sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credentials Theft:** Local users could obtain the FTP credentials by listing the process and its arguments using commands like `ps wax | grep backup-manager`.
*   **Unauthorized Access:**  With the stolen FTP credentials, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the FTP server where backups were stored, enabling them to download and extract the backups potentially containing sensitive data.
*   **Complete access to backed up data:** The attacker would have access to all backed-up files, including those originally only accessible by root.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:**  The vulnerability could be exploited by any user with shell access on the system running `backup-manager`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** An attacker needed to be a local user on the system where `backup-manager` was running.
*   **Basic System Knowledge:**  The attacker needed basic knowledge of using shell commands like `ps` and `grep`.
*   **No root permissions required:** This vulnerability does not require root level permissions to be exploited.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in versions of Backup Manager prior to 0.6.3.
*   The fix involves changing how the password is passed to the `backup-manager-upload` script:
    *   Initially, the password was passed directly as a command line argument.
    *   The fix passes the password via the environment variable `$ENV{BM_UPLOAD_FTP_PASSWORD}` instead of via the command line.
*   The fix was backported to older releases including the sarge and etch releases of Debian.

This information is more detailed than the brief description in the CVE, which simply states "...allows local users to obtain sensitive information by listing the process and its arguments...".
