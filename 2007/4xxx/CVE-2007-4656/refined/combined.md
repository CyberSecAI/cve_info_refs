How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: backup-manager: password disclosure in backup uploads
Date: Fri, 24 Aug 2007 21:02:58 +0200
```
Package: backup-manager
Version: 0.7.5-3
Severity: critical
Tags: security
Justification: root security hole

Hi,

I just discovered that backup-manager disclosures the FTP password
during a running FTP upload in the process list.

A user which has shell access on the computer simply needs to run the command

   ps wax | grep backup-manager

to get the FTP username, hostname and password. The output is something
like (I replaced here the sensitive data by FTPHOST, FTPUSER and FTPPASS):

 3796 pts/1    SN+    0:00 /bin/bash /usr/sbin/backup-manager -v
12647 pts/1    RN+    0:47 /usr/bin/perl /usr/bin/backup-manager-upload -v --ftp-purge -m=ftp -h=FTPHOST -u=FTPUSER -p=FTPPASS ...

With these data the attacking user is able to login into the same FTP
space where the archives created by backup-manager are uploaded to. So
the attacking user is also able to simply download these archive and
extract them as a normal user -- with full access on all included files,
even on those originally accessible by root only. :-(

Have a nice day
   Micha

Subject: [backup-manager] Fix proposed upstream
Date: Wed, 29 Aug 2007 11:49:26 +0200
```
Hello,

A fix has been proposed and is waiting for approval by the development
team upstream. We welcome very much the Debian's point of view of the
solution submited here.

patch:
  <http://bugzilla.backup-manager.org/cgi-bin/attachment.cgi?id=64>

  use private temp file for passing the password to b-m-u

  This way we hide the password in a file which is readable only by the
  user who launched backup-manager, and saved in his home directory.
  backup-manager-upload is passed the path to that file instead of the
  password itself.

Feel free to comment on.

Regards,

--
Alexis Sukrieh

Please, ignore that patch. There is cleaner solution which is using the
environement variable already exported by the first script.

Sorry for the noise.

The patch that will be procvided upstream will be about reading
$ENV{BM_UPLOAD_FTP_PASSWORD} instead of taking it from the command line.

Regards.

Hi,

I've just uploaded a patched version to sid (0.7.6-4) and have prepared
a fix for the stable package.

Find attached a patch to apply to the stable package (0.7.5-3).
I also attached the .dsc and .diff.gz resulting of the build for stable.

Feel free to tell me if you need anything else for closing the bug in
stable.

PS: I did as it's documented in the developer's reference and did not
upload anything to stable-proposed-update as this is about security:

<http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/ch-pkgs.en.html#s-bug-security>

I hope I did right.

Regards,

Hi,

I've submitted a patch for the etch package to the security team. It's
in their hands and is waiting for approval.

I'm waiting to see it going into the security updates as well ;)

Package        : backup-manager
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-4656
Debian Bug     : 439392

Micha Lenk discovered that backup-manager, a command-line backup tool,
sends the password as a command line argument when calling a FTP client,
which may allow a local attacker to read this password (which provides
access to all backed-up files) from the process listing.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.7.5-4.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.7-1sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
0.7.6-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your backup-manager package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
