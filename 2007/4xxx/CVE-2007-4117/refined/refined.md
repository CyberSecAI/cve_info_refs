```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `$PN_PathPrefix` variable in `index.php`. This variable, intended to define a path prefix for included files, is taken directly from user-supplied input via a GET parameter without sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The application directly includes a file path from user-controlled data, allowing the attacker to specify an arbitrary URL.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, leading to complete compromise of the vulnerable application and potentially the hosting server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the `PN_PathPrefix` parameter to include an arbitrary PHP file hosted on a remote server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and host a malicious PHP file on a publicly accessible server."
