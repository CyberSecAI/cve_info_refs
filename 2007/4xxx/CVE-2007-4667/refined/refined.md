  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-4667",
      "description": "A vulnerability exists in the Firebird database where, if an error occurs during service startup (SVC_start), the service handle is deleted, but the Y-handle retains a pointer to the freed memory. Subsequent requests using this Y-handle can cause unpredictable results, including potential server shutdown due to a non-zero value inadvertently triggering the shutdown sequence.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a failure to properly manage the service handle. Specifically, when SVC_start fails, the handle is freed, but the corresponding Y-handle is not updated or invalidated.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper resource management",
        "Use-after-free vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service or arbitrary code execution",
        "attack_vector": "By sending multiple requests to the service API after triggering an error during service startup",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs the ability to interact with the service API to cause an error during startup and to send subsequent requests."
