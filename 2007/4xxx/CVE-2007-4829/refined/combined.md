| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2007-09-18 16:18:42 UTC  ``` Directory traversal vulnerability in Archive::Tar perl module allows user-assisted remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files writable by user running application using this module via an absolute path or a .. (dot dot) sequence in filenames in a TAR archive.  Similar issues were reported and fixed for GNU tar during past several years, e.g.: [CVE-2001-1267](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2001-1267), [CVE-2002-0399](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2002-0399), [CVE-2002-1216](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2002-1216) and [CVE-2007-4131](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-4131).  This issue is important when this module is used to extract tar archives from untrusted sources.  However, some of such applications either implement workarounds / own checks (sa-update in spamassassin) or dropped module support at all (amavisd-new).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2007-09-18 16:20:50 UTC  ``` Similar issue was reported for Python's tarfile module, see #263261.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2007-09-24 18:30:12 UTC  ``` Upstream bug report:  <http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=29517>    ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c5)  Lubomir Kundrak    2007-11-09 17:49:41 UTC  ``` Is there any chance this will get addressed for fedora?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c6)  Robin Norwood    2007-11-09 18:23:19 UTC  ``` Once we have a fix for it, that fix will go into all supported versions of fedora ASAP.  We don't have a fix yet, though.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c8)  Jan Pazdziora (Red Hat)    2008-03-05 14:25:11 UTC  ``` The Archive::Tar 1.38 is now available on CPAN, with the following in CHANGES:  * important changes in vesrion 1.38    14/12/2007: - Promote 1.37_01 to stable.  * important changes in version 1.37_01 11/11/2007: _ Address #30380: directory traversal vulnerability in Archive-Tar   - Add $INSECURE_EXTRACT_MODE which defaults to 0, disallowing     archives to extract files outside of cwd(). This is a backwards     incompatible change from 1.36 and before.   - Add a -I option to ptar to enable insecure extraction if needed  So using this version in Fedoras seems like a way to to go. The diff from 1.34 (which we have in F8 and rawhide) and 1.36 is VMS specific, and diff from 1.36 to 1.38 is exactly fix for this bugzilla, so it should be safe to rebase.  Hmmm. Should I put this note to release-specific bugzillas?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2008-03-05 15:53:28 UTC  ``` Sadly, upstream version 1.38 is still prone to the directory traversal attack using symlinks, as described in old Willy Tarreau's BugTraq post:  <http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=90674255917321>  That problem was already pointed out in the upstream bug report.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c10)  Jan Pazdziora (Red Hat)    2008-03-05 16:03:49 UTC  ``` You are right. I should have said "diff from 1.36 to 1.38 is a partial fix for this bugzilla and not other changes".  Is it better to wait for definitive fix, or close that one hole that 1.38 addresses, for the time being?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c11)  Miroslav Suchý    2008-03-19 13:46:10 UTC  ``` See: <http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30380#txn-436899>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c12)  Lubomir Kundrak    2008-04-04 15:56:17 UTC  ``` Maintainers; could you please punch upstream about this a bit? In case not, what about applying Mirek's patch referred to in comment $11?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2008-04-07 10:02:10 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c12)) > Maintainers; could you please punch upstream about this a bit? In case not, what > about applying Mirek's patch referred to in comment $11?  Sorry, Mirek's patch does not resolve the issue.    ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c15)  Tuomo Soini    2008-12-11 06:14:20 UTC  ``` This should now be fixed upstream.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c16)  Tomas Hoger    2008-12-11 08:50:55 UTC  ``` 1.40 does following to cover known vectors:  - absolute paths are rejected - all paths that include '..' as one of the elements are rejected - extracting to symlink directories is denied  (applies to default SECURE EXTRACT MODE)  perl-Archive-Tar is now core perl module (as of perl 5.10 / F9, iirc), so Fedora updates will have to go via perl update.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c17)  Tuomo Soini    2008-12-11 10:17:12 UTC  ``` rhel5 is still vulnerable...   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c18)  Fedora Update System    2008-12-22 13:25:02 UTC  ``` perl-5.10.0-52.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/perl-5.10.0-52.fc10>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c19)  Fedora Update System    2008-12-30 23:44:35 UTC  ``` perl-5.10.0-52.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c20)  Vincent Danen    2009-07-29 01:27:33 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 514322](show_bug.cgi?id=514322 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2007-4829 perl-Archive-Tar directory traversal flaws") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c21)  Tuomo Soini    2010-03-31 07:26:14 UTC  ``` I'd like to point out that perl-Archive-Tar-1.30-1.fc6 which is in rhel5 is still vulnerable as of rhel-5.5.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c22)  Vincent Danen    2010-04-06 14:53:10 UTC  ``` We had provided an NVD statement for this regarding Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5:  <https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2007-4829.html>  It should have been noted here as well, however.  The Red Hat Security Response Team does not consider this bug to be a security issue. It is not suggested behavior to extract archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection of the archive contents.   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c32)  Tomas Hoger    2010-05-25 13:32:42 UTC  ``` Raising priority here to make sure perl-Archive-Tar versions in RHEL4 and RHEL5 are update to address this issue.  This flaw in perl-Archive-Tar did not affect other components shipped in RHEL using this perl module, as extract() method is not used.  It should also be noted that update Archive::Tar may fail to extract certain non-standard, but non-malicious archives that use one of the restricted paths or links (see [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c16)), but don't attempt to leave current working directory during the archive extraction.   ```  [Comment 39](show_bug.cgi?id=295021#c39)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-07-01 18:58:40 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2010:0505 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0505.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Archive::Tar: Directory traversal vulnerability — GLSA **200812-10**

A directory traversal vulnerability has been discovered in Archive::Tar.

### Affected packages

| Package | **perl-core/Archive-Tar** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.40** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.40** |

### Background

Archive::Tar is a Perl module for creation and manipulation of tar
files.

### Description

Jonathan Smith of rPath reported that Archive::Tar does not check for
".." in file names.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to extract a
specially crafted tar archive, overwriting files at arbitrary locations
outside of the specified directory.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Archive::Tar users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=perl-core/Archive-Tar-1.40"
```

# USN-700-1: Perl vulnerabilities

24 December 2008

Perl vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [libarchive-tar-perl](/security/cves?package=libarchive-tar-perl) -
* [perl](/security/cves?package=perl) -

## Details

Jonathan Smith discovered that the Archive::Tar Perl module did not

correctly handle symlinks when extracting archives. If a user or

automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted tar file,

a remote attacker could over-write arbitrary files. ([CVE-2007-4829](/security/CVE-2007-4829))

Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry discovered that Perl did not correctly

handle certain utf8 characters in regular expressions. If a user or

automated system were tricked into using a specially crafted expression,

a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial

of service. Ubuntu 8.10 was not affected by this issue. ([CVE-2008-1927](/security/CVE-2008-1927))

A race condition was discovered in the File::Path Perl module's rmtree

function. If a local attacker successfully raced another user's call

of rmtree, they could create arbitrary setuid binaries. Ubuntu 6.06

and 8.10 were not affected by this issue. ([CVE-2008-5302](/security/CVE-2008-5302))

A race condition was discovered in the File::Path Perl module's rmtree

function. If a local attacker successfully raced another user's call of

rmtree, they could delete arbitrary files. Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected

by this issue. ([CVE-2008-5303](/security/CVE-2008-5303))

# USN-700-2: Perl regression

15 January 2009

Perl regression

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [perl](/security/cves?package=perl) -

## Details

USN-700-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Perl. Due to problems with the Ubuntu

8.04 build, some Perl .ph files were missing from the resulting update.

This update fixes the problem. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Jonathan Smith discovered that the Archive::Tar Perl module did not

correctly handle symlinks when extracting archives. If a user or

automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted tar file,

a remote attacker could over-write arbitrary files. ([CVE-2007-4829](/security/CVE-2007-4829))

Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry discovered that Perl did not correctly

handle certain utf8 characters in regular expressions. If a user or

automated system were tricked into using a specially crafted expression,

a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial

of service. Ubuntu 8.10 was not affected by this issue. ([CVE-2008-1927](/security/CVE-2008-1927))

A race condition was discovered in the File::Path Perl module's rmtree

function. If a local attacker successfully raced another user's call

of rmtree, they could create arbitrary setuid binaries. Ubuntu 6.06

and 8.10 were not affected by this issue. ([CVE-2008-5302](/security/CVE-2008-5302))

A race condition was discovered in the File::Path Perl module's rmtree

function. If a local attacker successfully raced another user's call of

rmtree, they could delete arbitrary files. Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected

by this issue. ([CVE-2008-5303](/security/CVE-2008-5303))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [perl](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/perl)
  -
  [5.8.8-12ubuntu0.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/perl/5.8.8-12ubuntu0.4)

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
