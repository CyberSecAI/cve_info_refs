**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The EnCase SAFE server uses IP authentication to verify the identity of the EnCase Servlet running on target machines. This is a weak authentication mechanism that can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Weak authentication: The EnCase SAFE server relies solely on IP addresses to identify target machines running the EnCase Servlet.
- Lack of cryptographic identification:  The EnCase Enterprise environment does not cryptographically identify the machine it is connecting to.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can supply the EnCase SAFE with a disk image from a machine other than the one the investigator requested. This can lead to the collection of incorrect or manipulated evidence, which could undermine investigations.

**Attack vectors:**
- ARP spoofing: An attacker can use ARP spoofing to redirect network traffic intended for the target machine to a machine under their control.
- Other well-known network attacks: The document mentions other network attacks can be used to supply a different image.
- DNS poisoning: The attacker can also poison the DNS to route the traffic to the attacker controlled machine

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Administrator access to the network: The attacker needs administrator-level access on the network where the EnCase Enterprise system is operating.
- Knowledgeable user: The attacker needs to be knowledgeable about networking and able to set up a machine with a specific IP address on the network.
- Ability to spoof IP addresses or manipulate network traffic.
