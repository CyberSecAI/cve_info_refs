{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The phpBB Mod Ktauber.com StylesDemo is vulnerable to blind SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Blind SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database. In this exploit, it extracts the user_password of user_id=2.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 's' parameter in the index.php request, an attacker can inject malicious SQL queries. The injected query uses a timing-based approach by using `benchmark` to observe differences in response times, which reveals the password character by character.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and observe the response time of these requests. No authentication is needed as the vulnerability is in the parameter of the URL."
