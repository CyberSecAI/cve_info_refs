{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `komentar.php` file of the AuraCMS forum module, specifically in how the `$id` variable is used in a SQL query. The `$id` variable, which is extracted from user input, is not properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection. The unsanitized `$id` variable allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords (which are base64 encoded), and potentially other sensitive information, as shown in the provided exploit. The attacker might also be able to modify or delete data within the database.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious SQL code within the `id` parameter. The vulnerability is remote and exploitable via HTTP requests.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable AuraCMS application. No authentication or other specific requirements are mentioned in the provided content."
