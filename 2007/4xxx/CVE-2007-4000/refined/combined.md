# MIT Kerberos 5: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200709-01**

Two vulnerabilities have been found in MIT Kerberos 5, which could allow a
remote unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-crypt/mit-krb5** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.3-r1** |

### Background

MIT Kerberos 5 is a suite of applications that implement the Kerberos
network protocol. kadmind is the MIT Kerberos 5 administration daemon.

### Description

A stack buffer overflow (CVE-2007-3999) has been reported in
svcauth\_gss\_validate() of the RPC library of kadmind. Another
vulnerability (CVE-2007-4000) has been found in
kadm5\_modify\_policy\_internal(), which does not check the return values
of krb5\_db\_get\_policy() correctly.

### Impact

The RPC related vulnerability can be exploited by a remote
unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges
on the host running kadmind. The second vulnerability requires the
remote attacker to be authenticated and to have "modify policy"
privileges. It could then also allow for the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MIT Kerberos 5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.5.3-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## MIT Kerberos 5 kadmind privilege escalation vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#377544

Original Release Date: 2007-09-04 | Last Revised: 2007-10-26

---

### Overview

MIT Kerberos kadmind contains a privilege escalation vulnerability that may allow an authenticated attacker to execute code with root privileges.

### Description

| Kerberos is a network authentication system that uses a trusted third party to authenticate clients and servers to each other. It is designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. MIT Kerberos code is used in network applications from a variety of different vendors and is included in many UNIX and Linux distributions. The kadmind daemon is the administration server that runs on the master Kerberos server.  From the kadmind manual page:*This command starts the KADM5 administration server. The administration server runs on the master Kerberos server, which stores the KDC principal database and the KADM5 policy database. Kadmind accepts remote requests to administer the information in these databases. Remote requests are sent, for example, by kadmin(8) and the kpasswd(1) command, both of which are clients of kadmind.*Per [MITKRB5-SA-2007-006](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2007-006.txt) there is a privilege execution vulnerability in kadmind that may allow an authenticated user with modify policy privileges to execute arbitrary code.

kadmind uninitialized pointer
CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C
See DETAILS for the expanded CVSSv2 metrics for this vulnerability.
SUMMARY
=======
This advisory concerns two vulnerabilities. CVE-2007-3999 is much
easier to exploit than CVE-2007-4000.
[CVE-2007-3999]
The MIT krb5 Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind) is vulnerable to
a stack buffer overflow in the RPCSEC\_GSS authentication flavor of the
RPC library. Third-party applications using the RPC library provided
with MIT krb5 may also be affected.
We have received a proof-of-concept exploit that does not appear to
execute malicious code, and we believe that this exploit is not
publicly circulated.
This is a bug in the RPC library in MIT krb5. It is not a bug in the
Kerberos protocol.
[CVE-2007-4000]
The MIT krb5 Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind) can write data
through an uninitialized pointer. We know of no working exploit code
for this vulnerability, and do not believe that any exploit code for
this vulnerability is circulating.
This is a bug in the kadmind in MIT krb5. It is not a bug in the
Kerberos protocol.
IMPACT
======
[CVE-2007-3999] An unauthenticated remote user may be able to cause a
host running kadmind to execute arbitrary code.
[CVE-2007-4000] An authenticated user with "modify policy" privilege
may be able to cause a host running kadmind to execute arbitrary code.
Successful exploitation of either vulnerability can compromise the
Kerberos key database and host security on the KDC host. (kadmind
typically runs as root.) Unsuccessful exploitation attempts will
likely result in kadmind crashing.
Third-party applications calling the RPC library provided with MIT
krb5 may be vulnerable to CVE-2007-3999.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
[CVE-2007-3999]
\* kadmind in MIT releases krb5-1.4 through krb5-1.6.2
\* third-party RPC server programs linked against the RPC library
included in MIT releases krb5-1.4 through krb5-1.6.2
\* MIT releases prior to krb5-1.4 did not contain the vulnerable code
[CVE-2007-4000]
\* kadmind in MIT releases krb5-1.5 through krb5-1.6.2
\* MIT releases prior to krb5-1.5 did not contain the vulnerable code
FIXES
=====
\* The patch for CVE-2007-3999 has been revised; the patch originally
released for svc\_auth\_gss.c allowed a 32-byte overflow. Depending
on the compilation environment and machine architecture, this may or
may not be a significant continued vulnerability. The new patch
below correctly checks the buffer length.
\* The upcoming krb5-1.6.3 release, as well as the upcoming krb5-1.5.5
maintenance release, will contain fixes for this vulnerability.
Prior to that release you may apply the following patch. Note that
releases prior to krb5-1.5 will not need the svr\_policy.c patch.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============
Thanks to Kevin Coffman (UMich), Will Fiveash (Sun), and Nico Williams
(Sun) for discovering the bug in the initial CVE-2007-3999 patch and
for help with developing the revised patch for CVE-2007-3999.
CVE-2007-3999 was discovered by Tenable Network Security and reported
to MIT Kerberos Team by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) of the
TippingPoint division of 3Com.
CVE-2007-4000 was discovered by Garrett Wollman of MIT CSAIL.
DETAILS
=======
[CVE-2007-3999]
The implementation of the RPCSEC\_GSS authentication flavor copies
untrusted data having an inadequately-validated length into a buffer
on the stack. In the function svcauth\_gss\_validate() in
src/lib/rpc/svc\_auth\_gss.c, which authenticates the incoming RPC
message, a memcpy() invocation copies a number of bytes into the
128-byte stack buffer "rpchdr". The length provided to this memcpy()
invocation comes from the RPC header and may be maliciously chosen.
The invocation of xdr\_callmsg(), which provides the decoded rpc\_msg
structure used by svcauth\_gss\_validate(), ensures that the provided
length does not exceed MAX\_AUTH\_BYTES, which is 400, but destination
buffer is smaller than this size, and can be trivially overflowed.
The vulnerable code executes prior to the completion of authentication
of the RPC message, and therefore requires no authentication to
exploit.
Exploitation of stack buffer overflows is trivial on many platforms.
[CVE-2007-4000]
CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C
CVSSv2 Base Score: 7.1
Access Vector: Network
Access Complexity: High
Authentication: Single
Confidentiality Impact: Complete
Integrity Impact: Complete
Availability Impact: Complete
CVSSv2 Temporal Score: 5.6
Exploitability: Proof-of-Concept
Remediation Level: Official Fix
Report Confidence: Confirmed
The function kadm5\_modify\_policy\_internal() in
src/lib/kadm5/srv/svr\_policy.c, does not check return values from
krb5\_db\_get\_policy() correctly. When the policy does not exist,
krb5\_db\_get\_policy() returns zero but sets the count retrieved records
to zero without initializing the output pointer. Subsequent code in
kadm5\_modify\_policy\_internal() can attempt to write data through this
pointer, causing memory corruption.
This vulnerability was not present in MIT releases prior to krb5-1.5.
In the krb5-1.5 release, changes related to the implementation of the
Database Abstraction Layer introduced this vulnerability.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
