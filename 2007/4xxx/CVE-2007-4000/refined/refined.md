    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-4000",
      "description": "The MIT krb5 Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind) can write data through an uninitialized pointer. The function kadm5_modify_policy_internal() in src/lib/kadm5/srv/svr_policy.c, does not check return values from krb5_db_get_policy() correctly. When the policy does not exist, krb5_db_get_policy() returns zero but sets the count retrieved records to zero without initializing the output pointer. Subsequent code in kadm5_modify_policy_internal() can attempt to write data through this pointer, causing memory corruption.",
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of return values from krb5_db_get_policy() in kadm5_modify_policy_internal() leading to use of an uninitialized pointer.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Use of Uninitialized Pointer",
        "Improper Error Handling"
      ],
      "impact": "An authenticated user with \"modify policy\" privileges may be able to execute arbitrary code on the host running kadmind, potentially leading to compromise of the Kerberos key database and host security on the KDC host.",
      "attack_vector": "Network",
      "required_capabilities": "An authenticated user with 'modify policy' privileges is required to exploit this vulnerability."
