  "cve": "CVE-2007-4993",
  "description": "By use of a specially crafted grub configuration file a domU user may be able to execute arbitary code upon the dom0 when pygrub is being used.",
  "affected_components": [
    "Xen hypervisor",
    "pygrub"

    "Improper input validation"
  ],
  "impact": "A malicious guest user can execute arbitrary code on the host (dom0)",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "A guest user can craft a malicious grub.conf file within their virtual machine.",
