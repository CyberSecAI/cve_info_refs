Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4828:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of input passed to unspecified parameters within the API pretty-printing mode of MediaWiki.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the API pretty-printing mode fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and script code into a user's browser session. This code executes within the context of the affected MediaWiki site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the MediaWiki API, specifically when using the "pretty-printing mode".
- An attacker crafts malicious input and passes it as a parameter to the vulnerable API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the MediaWiki API.
- The API interface must be enabled on the target MediaWiki instance, which is the default setting for 1.9, 1.10 and 1.11 and must be explicitly enabled on 1.8.
- No special privileges are required, and the attacker exploits the vulnerability through the API.

**Vulnerable Versions:**
* MediaWiki 1.11 <= 1.11.0rc1
* MediaWiki 1.10 <= 1.10.1
* MediaWiki 1.9 <= 1.9.3
* MediaWiki 1.8 <= 1.8.4 (if $wgEnableAPI has been switched on)

**Non-Vulnerable Versions**
* MediaWiki 1.11 >= 1.11.0
* MediaWiki 1.10 >= 1.10.2
* MediaWiki 1.9 >= 1.9.4
* MediaWiki 1.8 >= 1.8.5

**Additional Notes:**
- The `lists.wikimedia.org` content provides a detailed description of the vulnerability and the versions that are affected.
- The `bugzilla.redhat.com` content confirms that the vulnerability affects Fedora's mediawiki package and that a fix has been released in version 1.9.4-35.fc7.
- A workaround for vulnerable versions is to disable the API interface by adding `$wgEnableAPI = false;` to LocalSettings.php.
