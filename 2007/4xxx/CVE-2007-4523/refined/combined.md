- id parameter in 'admin/pages/delete\_page.php',
'admin/navigation/delete\_menu.php' and 'delete\_item.php'
- new\_menuname parameter in 'admin/navigation/do\_new\_nav.php',
- url and name parameters in 'admin/navigation/new\_nav\_item.php' and
- area1, name parameters in 'admin/pages/do\_new\_page.php'
Impact:
-------
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script,
steal cookie related information in the context of an affected web site
and execute sql queries.
To exploit this, an attacker should have login credentials.
Affected Software(s):
---------------------
Ripe Website Manager 0.8.9 and prior
Proof of Concept:
-----------------
After logging in as valid user,
SQL Injection:
http://example.com/admin/pages/delete\_page.php?id=0 or 1=1
XSS:
Go to the http://www.example.com/admin/pages/new\_page.php
and insert <script>alert("XSS")</script> in 'Title' field or
'textarea' field.
OR
Go to the http://www.example.com/admin/navigation/new\_nav\_item.php
and insert <script>alert("XSS")</script> in 'Name' or 'Link to url'
fields.
Analysis:
---------
1. Vulnerable portion of code in Ripe/admin/pages/delete\_page.php,
admin/navigation/delete\_item.php and delete\_menu.php
$id = $\_GET['id'];
2. Vulnerable portion of code in Ripe/admin/navigation/do\_new\_item.php
$menu\_id=$\_POST['menu\_id'];
$name=$\_POST['name'];
$page\_id=$\_POST['page\_id'];
$url=$\_POST['url'];
3. Vulnerable portion of code in Ripe/admin/navigation/do\_new\_nav.php
$new\_menuname=$\_POST['new\_menuname'];
4. Vulnerable portion of code in Ripe/admin/pages/do\_new\_page.php
$area1=$\_POST['area1'];
$name=$\_POST['name'];
$url=$\_POST['url'];
CVSS Score Report:
------------------
ACCESS\_VECTOR = NETWORK
ACCESS\_COMPLEXITY = LOW
AUTHENTICATION = SINGLE INSTANCE
CONFIDENTIALITY\_IMPACT = PARTIAL
INTEGRITY\_IMPACT = PARTIAL
AVAILABILITY\_IMPACT = PARTIAL
EXPLOITABILITY = PROOF\_OF\_CONCEPT
REMEDIATION\_LEVEL = OFFICIAL\_FIX
REPORT\_CONFIDENCE = CONFIRMED
CVSS Base Score = 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:SI/C:P/I:P/A:P)
CVSS Temporal Score = 5.1
Risk factor = High
Solution:
-----------
Upgrade to the latest version 0.8.10 of Ripe Web Site Manager. The design
change implemented ensures that other users do not have permission to perform
the above operations.
Credits:
-----------
Nagendra Kumar G and Arun Kethipelly of OS2A have been credited with the
discovery for these vulnerabilities.
