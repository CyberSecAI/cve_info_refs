  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A vulnerability exists in the way Cisco IOS handles regular expressions when processing the `show ip bgp regexp` command.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is triggered by a specific regular expression pattern used with the `show ip bgp regexp` command during BGP updates, causing a crash.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A router crash. Publicly accessible BGP looking glasses can be crashed due to this vulnerability.",
  "Attack vectors": "Executing the `show ip bgp regexp` command with a crafted regular expression. The command must be executed by a user with valid credentials on the device, although publicly available BGP looking glasses are also vulnerable.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs valid credentials to access the router or target publicly available BGP looking glasses which does not require credentials. The attacker needs to execute the `show ip bgp regexp` command with a crafted regular expression."
