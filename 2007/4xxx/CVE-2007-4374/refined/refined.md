  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application crashes due to a malformed UDP packet.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper bounds check on UDP packet size.",
      "Uncontrolled memory access via memcpy."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) through application crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted UDP packet to the game server or client on port 11111."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker must be able to send UDP packets to the vulnerable server or client.",
    "details": "The vulnerability lies in the handling of UDP packets on port 11111. The application reads a 16-bit value from the packet which specifies the size of the data. However, a small UDP packet with a large size value will cause the application to attempt to copy data beyond the bounds of the packet leading to a crash using memcpy."
