Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4491:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw found in the `uyeler2.php` file of the Gurur Portal (tr) application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The `id` parameter in the `uyeler2.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive data stored in the database, such as usernames, passwords (likely hashed but still a security risk), and other user information from the `uyeler` table.
*   **Integrity Compromise:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data from the database.
*   **Availability Impact:** While not explicitly mentioned, SQL injection can lead to denial of service by making the database unavailable or corrupting it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious URL using the HTTP GET method, specifically targeting the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any authentication.
*   **Basic Network Access:** An attacker only needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable server hosting the Gurur Portal application.
*   **Knowledge of SQL Syntax:** Some knowledge of SQL is required to formulate the injection payload.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided exploit example is as follows:
    ```
    site.com/path/uyeler2.php?id=-1%20union+select+0,kadi,2,id,sifre,5,6,7,8,9,10,11+from+uyeler
    ```
    This injects a SQL `UNION SELECT` statement that retrieves the `kadi`, `id`, and `sifre` fields from the `uyeler` table.
*   The reference suggests the vulnerability is present in the `uyeler2.php` script.

**CVSS:**

*   **Base Score:** 7.5/10
*   **Exploitability Subscore:** 10/10
*   **Impact Subscore:** 6.4/10
*   **Attack Complexity:** Low
*   **Authentication:** None
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** Partial
*   **Integrity Impact:** Partial
*   **Availability Impact:** Partial

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by "the dumenci".
*   The vulnerable software is Gurur Haber v2.0, but the exploit example references files from v1.3, this could be a potential typo.
