Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `rubrik.php` file of Webace-Linkscript version 1.3 SE.
- The script uses `mysql_fetch_array` to fetch a rubric name based on the 'id' parameter provided in the URL.
- The `id` parameter from `$HTTP_GET_VARS['id']` is directly used in the SQL query without proper sanitization or filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of proper input validation on the `id` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** An attacker can leverage SQL injection to retrieve sensitive data from the database. This is demonstrated in the Proof of Concept (POC) which shows how to extract usernames and passwords from the `wls_eintrag` table.
- **Potential for wider system compromise:** Depending on the database user permissions and the database setup, the attacker could also potentially modify or delete data, or even gain access to the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication or prior knowledge is required.
- The attacker can be in any network position that allows communication to the server (remote).

**Technical Details (from exploit-db):**

- **Vulnerable File:** `/go/rubrik.php`
- **Vulnerable Code Snippet:** `$rubrikname = mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query('SELECT name FROM wls_rubriken WHERE id='.$HTTP_GET_VARS['id']));`
- **Proof of Concept (POC) Example:**
    `http://localhost/wls_v1.3se/start.php?go=rubrik&id=-1/**/union/**/select/**/null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,login,passwort,null,null,null,null,null/**/from/**/wls_eintrag/*`
    This POC demonstrates how to use a union-based SQL injection to extract the `login` and `passwort` fields from the `wls_eintrag` table.
