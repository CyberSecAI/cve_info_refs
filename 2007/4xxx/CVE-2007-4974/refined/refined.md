{
  "CVE-2007-4974": {
    "description": "Robert Buchholz discovered that libsndfile did not correctly validate the size of its memory buffers. If a user were tricked into playing a specially crafted FLAC file, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges.",
    "root_cause": "libsndfile did not correctly validate the size of its memory buffers when processing FLAC files, specifically in the `flac_buffer_copy()` function, allowing a heap overflow.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient size validation when handling FLAC streams with variable block sizes."
      ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user playing a specially crafted FLAC file or network stream.",
    "attack_vectors": "A user must be tricked into opening a specially crafted FLAC file or network stream.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious FLAC file and entice a user to open it with an application using the vulnerable libsndfile library. This means an attacker needs to deliver the malicious file to the victim, possibly through phishing, a compromised website or other social engineering techniques."
