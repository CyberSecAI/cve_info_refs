Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `xGB.php` script of xGB version 2.0. It appears to lack proper access control, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication and directly access administrative functions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is an **authentication bypass**. The script does not properly verify user permissions before allowing access to the edit functionality.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can **edit all messages** within the xGB guestbook. This could include:
*   Modifying or deleting legitimate user messages
*   Injecting malicious content
*   Defacing the guestbook

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a **direct HTTP request** to the vulnerable `xGB.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to:
*   Know the path to the `xGB.php` script
*   Have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server

**More detail than the CVE description:**
The provided text gives the exact vulnerable script (`xGB.php`), the vulnerable parameter (`act=admin&do=edit`), and a Google dork to find potentially vulnerable instances of the software, thus it provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description.
