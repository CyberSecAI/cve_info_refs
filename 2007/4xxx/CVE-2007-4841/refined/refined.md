  "CVE-2007-4841": {
    "Description": "On Windows XP with Internet Explorer 7 installed, several web-related URI schemes do not launch the registered protocol-handler if the URI contains an invalid %-encoded sequence. This could cause unexpected file handlers to be launched. The affected schemes are http, https, ftp, file, gopher, telnet, mailto, news, snews, nttp, wais, mk. This vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user into clicking on a malicious URI, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause is that on Windows XP with IE7, the ShellExecute function incorrectly handles URIs with invalid %-encoding. Instead of launching the registered protocol handler for the URI, it may launch a different application associated with an extension found in the URI string.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of URI schemes on Windows",
      "Windows ShellExecute function mishandling of URI schemes",
      "Failure to sanitize URI input strings"
    ],
    "Impact": "Exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution through the launching of an unexpected application. This could be achieved by tricking a user into clicking a specially crafted malicious link. ",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Malicious URIs embedded in web pages or emails",
      "User interaction required (clicking a malicious URI)"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to craft malicious URIs",
      "Ability to deliver crafted URI to user through web pages or emails"
    ],
   "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is specific to Windows XP with Internet Explorer 7 installed, and is related to the way the Windows ShellExecute API handles URIs with invalid percent-encoding. Firefox and other browsers were vulnerable due to using the Windows API to handle URIs. Mitigation was implemented in Firefox to use `SHParseDisplayName` API to detect and prevent the incorrect file-handling programs from launching which left some risk. A patch has been applied to Firefox that detects when Windows would mishandle these URIs so that the wrong program does not get launched."
