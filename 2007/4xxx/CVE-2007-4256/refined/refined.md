{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `showpage.cgi` script in YNP Portal System 2.2.0 is vulnerable to directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `p` parameter in the `showpage.cgi` script is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to use directory traversal sequences such as `../` to access files outside of the intended directory.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially disclosing sensitive information like configuration files or system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is accessed through the HTTP GET request to `showpage.cgi` with a crafted `p` parameter containing directory traversal sequences.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. There are no apparent authentication requirements."
