How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package: reprepro
Version: 1.3.0-1
Severity: serious
Tags: etch security patch

This bug is just to document that the bug closed in 2.2.4 is still open in etch:

Version 1.3.0 included the change from libgpgme6 to libgpgme11. But a
part of this patch got lost, and thus reprepro only checks for
signatures with requested keys to be valid when updating a repository
from a remote one with the "update" command and does not complain if
there is no signature with a requested key at all. (Thus accepting
anything signed with only a unknown key for example).

Version prior to 1.3.0 and since 2.2.4 are not affected. Only updating
is affected. Checking keys when including packages by hand or via an
incoming dir is not affected.

I've sent a mail with the attached files to team@security.debian.org
at August 20th, but got no reply since then. Thus attaching them here
again.

Hochachtungsvoll,
	Bernhard R. Link

Thank you for your work, I've reviewed it and I'm wondering about why you made
this change specifically:

-		if( kl < fl && strncmp(fingerprint+fl-kl,keypart,kl) == 0 )
+		if( kl < fl && strncasecmp(fingerprint+fl-kl,keypart,kl) == 0 )

Can you clarify?

Thanks!

Thijs

libgpgme always returns the fingerprints in upper case, and if cases
mismatches reprepro will just print that none of the requested keys were
found. (because no key with lower case fingerprint was found, as there
can't be some with libgpgme).
As humans often tend to use lower case, this could lead to some confusion when
upgrading (as it looks like it worked before and then suddenly claims
there is no known key while there is, just with the wrong key).

Hochachtungsvoll,

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : reprepro
Vulnerability  : authentication bypass
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: yes
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-4739
Debian Bug     : 440535

It was discovered that reprepro, a tool to create a repository of Debian
packages, when updating from a remote site only checks for the validity of
known signatures, and thus does not reject packages with only unknown
signatures. This allows an attacker to bypass this authentication
mechanism.

The oldstable distribution (sarge) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.1+1-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your reprepro package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
