Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4773:

**CVE Description:**
The provided text indicates that CVE-2007-4773 relates to a vulnerability fixed in Systrace version 1.6e. The vulnerability was reported by Tavis Ormandy.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability was a potential escape of socket aliases and a double free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Socket alias escape: This suggests a flaw in how Systrace was handling or tracking socket aliases, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of sockets.
- Double free: A double free condition occurs when memory is freed twice, which can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: The double free could corrupt memory.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: A combination of the two flaws could lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the affected system.
- Unauthorized socket manipulation: The socket alias escape could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate network connections in unintended ways.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector would likely involve crafted system calls or sequences of operations that trigger the socket alias escape and/or the double free condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would likely need to be able to execute code that makes use of the vulnerable system calls or sequences. They would also need to be able to trigger specific conditions to exploit the memory corruption/double free issue.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description by identifying the specific vulnerability types and their potential impact.
- The content explicitly mentions the vulnerability was fixed in version 1.6e of Systrace, and it was reported by Tavis Ormandy.
