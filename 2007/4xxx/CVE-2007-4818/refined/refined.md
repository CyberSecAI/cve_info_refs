The provided content contains information about CVE-2007-4818.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper definition for the `$doc_root` variable in several PHP files within the Txx CMS application. This allows an attacker to manipulate the include path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to remote file inclusion due to the missing definition of `$doc_root`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can include malicious remote files into the vulnerable application.
- This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the `doc_root` parameter in the HTTP request to include a malicious file from a remote server, such as:  `http://site.com/modules/addons/plugin.php?doc_root=[vuln]`.
- Affected files include `modules/addons/plugin.php`, `modules/addons/sidebar.php`, `modules/mail/index.php`, and `modules/mail/mailbox.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to control a server hosting a malicious file.
