{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A defect in the reseeding code of the random driver leads to a reduction in entropy.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient entropy generation"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could potentially weaken the randomness of generated data, which might affect security-sensitive operations that rely on unpredictable random numbers.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is located in the kernel's random driver, which is used by the operating system and applications to generate random numbers.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are mentioned, but the attacker would need some mechanism to cause reseeding of the random number generator, which is a normal function within the OS."
