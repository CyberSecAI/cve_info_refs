Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4668:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Firebird handles database attach/create calls. Specifically, the password validation process occurs late in the connection sequence, after the server has already attempted to access the file specified in the connection string. This behavior allows an attacker to distinguish between valid and invalid resources based on the different error messages returned by the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure: The vulnerability leaks information about the existence of files on the server by returning different error messages when attempting to connect to a valid or invalid file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is information disclosure, enabling a remote attacker to determine if specific files exist on the target system. This can be a stepping stone for further, more targeted attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending specially crafted connection requests to the Firebird server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to initiate a connection to the Firebird server. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the vulnerability is triggered before authentication. The attacker only needs network access to the service.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Firebird versions up to 2.0.1.
- The fix was implemented in Firebird 2.0.2.
- The vulnerability was reported by David Calligaris.
- The Debian Security Advisory DSA-1529-1 references this CVE, indicating it was addressed in the updated Firebird packages.
- The issue is also tracked in the Firebird bug tracker as CORE1312 and issue #1731 in Github.
