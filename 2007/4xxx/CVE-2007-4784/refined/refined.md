{
  "CVE-2007-4784": {
    "Description": "The setlocale() function in PHP before 5.2.4 is vulnerable to a denial of service.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `setlocale()` function does not properly handle excessively long strings, leading to a crash due to a segmentation fault.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS)",
      "Improper Input Handling"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by providing an overly long string to the setlocale() function. This can lead to the PHP process crashing and the web application becoming unavailable.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a request to a PHP application that uses the `setlocale()` function with a very long string parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a PHP web server and be able to influence parameters passed to the `setlocale()` function. No authentication is needed."
