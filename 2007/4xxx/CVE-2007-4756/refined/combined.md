Total Commander not affected by vulnerability in log4j **December 15, 2021:** We currently get a lot of questions whether Total Commander is affected by the [log4j Java vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046)](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/ "Opens in new window"):  Total Commander for Windows is not based on Java, and is not using log4j, so it is not directly affected.  There are some very old 32-bit java-based third party plugins from 2007, but they use an older, not vulnerable version of log4j: The included log4j-1.2.8.jar is not vulnerable, because the vulnerable JNDI lookup functions were only added in log4j 2.0.0. These plugins use the [Java Plugin Interface](http://totalcmd.net/plugring/tc_java.html). You may want to search for tc\_javaplugin.ini to check if you have any of them installed.  Total Commander for Android is based on Java, but neither it nor any of the plugins uses log4j.

Secure FTP client (FTP over SSL/TLS) broken by recent Windows update **October 13, 2019:** Unfortunately a recent security update in Windows 7/8/8.1/10 has broken the sChannel (Secur32.dll) Windows library used for secure FTP connections in Total Commander: The connection fails downloading the directory listing if the server requires SSL session re-use.

If you get the error: **OFFLINE3, error=0** when trying to connect to an FTP server, please [**download the OpenSSL dlls here**](openssl).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
