the ServerProtect home directory. To roll back, just rename the
backup files and use them to replace the current files.
3. After the rollback, run the following commands to start the
ServerProtect services:
net start spntsvc
net start earthagent
net start "TrendMicro Infrastructure"

## Trend Micro ServerProtect Integer Overflow Vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#959400

Original Release Date: 2007-08-23 | Last Revised: 2007-08-23

---

### Overview

Trend Micro ServerProtect contains an integer overflow vulnerability that may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| Trend Micro [ServerProtect](http://us.trendmicro.com/us/products/enterprise/serverprotect-for-microsoft-windows/index.html) is an anti-virus application designed to run on Microsoft Windows servers. The application provides administrators with centralized management of multiple servers. The ServerProtect architecture includes a management console, information server, and the server which has ServerProtect installed.  The ServerProtect executable that runs on the server being protected by the anti-virus engine is called SpntSvc.exe. This executable uses the StRpcSrv.dll library to handle RPC requests on 5168/tcp. The ServerProtect component contains an integer overflow vulnerability within the RPC function RPCFN\_SYNC\_TASK. A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to trigger the overflow by sending malformed RPC request to a vulnerable system. |
