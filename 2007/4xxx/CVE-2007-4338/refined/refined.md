Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4338:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is related to the way Family Connections (FCMS) handles session information. Specifically, the `index.php` script uses the value of the `fcms_login_id` cookie to set the `login_id` session variable:
```php
if (isset($_COOKIE['fcms_login_id'])) {
    $_SESSION['login_id'] = $_COOKIE['fcms_login_id'];
}
```

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Session Handling:** The primary weakness is that the `login_id` session variable is directly set from a user-controlled cookie (`fcms_login_id`) without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the cookie and potentially inject malicious values into the session.
*   **Potential SQL Injection:** The analysis of `index.php` mentions a `mysql_query()` call, which could be vulnerable to SQL injection if user-supplied data is used to construct the query without proper sanitization. However, this is not the focus of the discussion around CVE-2007-4338.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The primary impact of successful exploitation is remote command execution:

*   **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands by manipulating the session, exploiting the vulnerability. While the exact mechanism for command execution is not explicitly described in the provided text, it suggests that the injected session data is used in such a manner.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the manipulation of the `fcms_login_id` cookie:
1.  **Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious value for the `fcms_login_id` cookie.
2.  **Session Hijacking/Poisoning:** When the user loads `index.php`, the server sets the session variable `login_id` to the malicious value provided by the crafted cookie.
3.  **Exploitation via Session:** The manipulated session is then leveraged to achieve remote command execution. The details of how exactly this session is used to execute commands are not provided.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Manipulate Cookies:** The attacker needs the ability to manipulate cookies sent to the victim's browser or be able to inject the cookie value directly to the application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the Family Connections application via a network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content mentions a dispute about the origin of the exploit, suggesting that the exploit may have been copied without proper credit from another product's exploit.
*   The vulnerability was resolved in Family Connections version 0.9, according to the vendor's email.
*   The content refers to a bug report and a SecurityFocus archive related to the issue.

In summary, CVE-2007-4338 describes a vulnerability in Family Connections (FCMS) where insecure handling of session variables derived from user-controlled cookies leads to potential remote command execution.
