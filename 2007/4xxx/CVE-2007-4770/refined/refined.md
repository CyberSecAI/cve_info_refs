Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4770:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of `\0` characters within regular expressions by the libicu library. Specifically, when compiling regular expressions, illegal backreferences might refer to a non-existent capture group '0', which leads to corrupted `REStackFrames`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** libicu fails to properly validate backreferences in regular expressions, specifically allowing references to the non-existent capture group '0'.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The corrupted `REStackFrames` resulting from the improper backreference handling leads to out-of-bounds reads or writes during later execution of the regular expression.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running an application linked against libicu. This is because the out-of-bounds memory access can be manipulated to overwrite critical data or jump to attacker-controlled code.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not the primary issue for this CVE, the content notes that a related CVE-2007-4771 involves an incomplete interval handling, which can cause a denial-of-service due to resource exhaustion via a crafted regex.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Regular Expressions:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially crafted regular expressions that include illegal backreferences to capture group '0'.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Input:** An attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted regular expression to an application that utilizes the vulnerable libicu library. This could be through a file, network input, or any other method by which the target application takes input that includes regular expressions.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Will Drewry of Google Security.
*   The issue was resolved in libicu versions 3.8.1-r1 or later, and revision 3.6-r2 or later
*   Several vendors like Ubuntu, Red Hat, Gentoo, and SUSE, issued security advisories and provided patches to address the vulnerability within their systems.
*   OpenOffice.org was specifically identified as one application potentially vulnerable through its use of libicu.
