## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

* [icu](/security/cves?package=icu) -

## Details

Will Drewry discovered that libicu did not properly handle '\0' when

processing regular expressions. If an application linked against libicu

processed a crafted regular expression, an attacker could execute

arbitrary code with privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2007-4770](/security/CVE-2007-4770))

Will Drewry discovered that libicu did not properly limit its

backtracking stack size. If an application linked against libicu

processed a crafted regular expression, an attacker could cause a denial

of service via resource exhaustion. ([CVE-2007-4771](/security/CVE-2007-4771))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [libicu36](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/icu)
  -
  [3.6-3ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/icu/3.6-3ubuntu0.1)

##### Ubuntu 7.04

* [libicu36](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/icu)
  -
  [3.6-2ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/icu/3.6-2ubuntu0.1)

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* [libicu34](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/icu)
  -
  [3.4.1a-1ubuntu1.6.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/icu/3.4.1a-1ubuntu1.6.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* [libicu34](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/icu)
  -
  [3.4.1a-1ubuntu1.6.06.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/icu/3.4.1a-1ubuntu1.6.06.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart applications linked

against libicu, such as OpenOffice.org, to effect the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# OpenOffice.org: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200805-16**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in OpenOffice.org, possibly
allowing for user-assisted execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-office/openoffice** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.4.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.4.0** |

| Package | **app-office/openoffice-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.4.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.4.0** |

### Background

OpenOffice.org is an open source office productivity suite, including
word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, drawing, data charting,
formula editing, and file conversion facilities.

### Description

iDefense Labs reported multiple vulnerabilities in OpenOffice.org:

* multiple heap-based buffer overflows when parsing the "Attribute" and
  "Font" Description records of Quattro Pro (QPRO) files
  (CVE-2007-5745),
* an integer overflow when parsing the EMR\_STRETCHBLT record of an EMF
  file, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2007-5746),
* an integer underflow when parsing Quattro Pro (QPRO) files, resulting
  in an excessive loop and a stack-based buffer overflow
  (CVE-2007-5747),
* and a heap-based buffer overflow when parsing the
  "DocumentSummaryInformation" stream in an OLE file (CVE-2008-0320).

Furthermore, Will Drewry (Google Security) reported vulnerabilities in
the memory management of the International Components for Unicode
(CVE-2007-4770, CVE-2007-4771), which was resolved with GLSA 200803-20.
However, the binary version of OpenOffice.org uses an internal copy of
said library.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
document, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenOffice.org users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-2.4.0"
```

All OpenOffice.org binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-2.4.0"
```

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0090)

## Topic

Updated icu packages that fix two security issues are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The International Components for Unicode (ICU) library provides robust and
full-featured Unicode services.

Will Drewry reported multiple flaws in the way libicu processed certain
malformed regular expressions. If an application linked against ICU, such
as OpenOffice.org, processed a carefully crafted regular expression, it may
be possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running the application.
(CVE-2007-4770, CVE-2007-4771)

All users of icu should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- Acroread wrapper script minor /tmp race
Adobe Acrobat Reader 8.1.2 contained a /tmp race in its "acroread"
wrapper script in the SSL certificate handling. (CVE-2008-0883)
This problem is not triggered by just starting acrobat reader,
but only on certificate handling.
Furthermore Acrobat Reader contained several duplicated copies of
system libraries, which have been removed by this update to make sure
they are up-to-date security wise by using the system provided ones.
Also on x86-64 platforms, the Mozilla embedding detection did not
work and was fixed, so the Splashscreen and Help are again displayed.
Updates have been released on SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10,
SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
Updates for version 7 for Novell Linux Desktop 9 and SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server 9 are still pending.
- Asterisk security issues
A security update was released for the PBX Asterisk, fixing following
security issues:
CVE-2007-6430: Attackers could bypass host based authentication by
using a valid user name.
CVE-2007-6170: Attackers could inject SQL commands under certain
circumstances if 'cdr\_pgsql' was used.
Asterisk was updated on SUSE Linux 10.1 and openSUSE 10.2.
- cacti various vulnerabilities
The following vulnerabilities were fixed in cacti:
- CVE-2008-0783: multiple XSS vulnerabilities
- CVE-2008-0784: path disclosure
- CVE-2008-0785: multiple SQL injections
- CVE-2008-0786: HTTP response splitting on very old PHP instances
Cacti is included in SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 and
was fixed there.
- compat-openssl097g security fixes
This update of compat-openssl097g fixes a off-by-one buffer overflow
in function SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers(). This vulnerability potentially
allows remote code execution; depending on memory layout of the
process. (CVE-2007-5135)
We released updates for openssl already, but an update for the compat
0.9.7g openssl libraries was missing and is provided with this patch.
Released for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE Linux 10.1 and openSUSE
10.2, 10.3.
- icu regular expression problems
Certain regular expressions could crash the ICU library
(CVE-2007-4770, CVE-2007-4771).
Updated icu packages have been released for all distributions.
- libcdio buffer overflow
A security bug was fixed in libcdio. Long file names in ISO file
systems with Joliet extension could cause a buffer overflow in
libcdio (CVE-2007-6613).
libcdio fixes were released for all SUSE Linux products.
- wireshark/ethereal security problems
The network analyzer wireshark (formerly known as ethereal) was
updated to fix the following security bugs:
- CVE-2008-1070: The SCTP dissector could crash on reception of bad packets
- CVE-2008-1071: The SNMP dissector could crash on reception of bad packets
- CVE-2008-1072: The TFTP dissector could crash Wireshark (maybe
a bug in the Cairo library on specific platforms)
- Jakarta Tomcat security problems
Various security issues in Jakarta Tomcat have been fixed:
- CVE-2006-7196: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
example JSP applications
- CVE-2007-3382: Handling of cookies containing a ' character
- CVE-2007-3385: Handling of \" in cookies
- CVE-2007-5461: tomcat path traversal / information leak
- CVE-2007-1860: directory traversal
- CVE-2008-0128: tomcat https information disclosure
- CVE-2005-2090: tomcat HTTP Request Smuggling
Updates have been released for all distributions.
- perl-Tk GIF security problem
Specially crafted GIF files could crash perl-Tk (CVE-2006-4484).
Fixed packages have been released for all distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command

- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

He reports:      On regular expression compilation, illegal backreferences may refer to the     non-existent capture group '0'.  When these are builts, they will result     in corrupt REStackFrames which will be used at a later point.  Crashes may     result in out of band reads or writes depending on the regular expression     being executed.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=429023#c3)  Caolan McNamara    2008-01-17 09:20:08 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 291973](attachment.cgi?id=291973 "An example of icu pattern matching in OOo") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=291973&action=edit "An example of icu pattern matching in OOo") An example of icu pattern matching in OOo  I figured out how to get OOo to match patterns with the icu regexp stuff.

He reports:      On regular expression compilation, illegal backreferences may refer to the     non-existent capture group '0'.  When these are builts, they will result     in corrupt REStackFrames which will be used at a later point.  Crashes may     result in out of band reads or writes depending on the regular expression     being executed.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=429023#c3)  Caolan McNamara    2008-01-17 09:20:08 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 291973](attachment.cgi?id=291973 "An example of icu pattern matching in OOo") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=291973&action=edit "An example of icu pattern matching in OOo") An example of icu pattern matching in OOo  I figured out how to get OOo to match patterns with the icu regexp stuff.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=429025#c0)  Josh Bressers    2008-01-16 21:08:57 UTC  ``` Will Drewry reported a flaw in the way libicu processes certain regular expressions.  He reports:      In the function doInterval, regexcmp.cpp:976, there isno check to ensure     than the upper interval is not -1.  This is intentional as unbounded upper     limits are allowed, however the remainder of the code does not gracefully     handle this case.  For instance, a heap overflow is possible due to the     doubling of memory as RegexMatcher::StateSave continues to backtrack.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=429025#c5)  Josh Bressers    2008-01-25 13:11:27 UTC  ``` This is now public: <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=d03a2ffb0801221538x68825e42xb4a4aaf0fcccecbd%40mail.gmail.com>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=429025#c7)  Fedora Update System    2008-01-27 07:13:11 UTC  ``` icu-3.8-5.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.

Package        : libicu
Vulnerability  : various
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : 2007-4770 2007-4771
Debian Bug     : 463688

Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in libicu,
International Components for Unicode, The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-4770
  libicu in International Components for Unicode (ICU) 3.8.1 and earlier
  attempts to process backreferences to the nonexistent capture group
  zero (aka \0), which might allow context-dependent attackers to read
  from, or write to, out-of-bounds memory locations, related to
  corruption of REStackFrames.

CVE-2007-4771
  Heap-based buffer overflow in the doInterval function in regexcmp.cpp
  in libicu in International Components for Unicode (ICU) 3.8.1 and
  earlier allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
  service (memory consumption) and possibly have unspecified other
  impact via a regular expression that writes a large amount of data to
  the backtracking stack.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6-2etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.8-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your libicu package.

This Privacy Policy clarifies the nature, scope and purpose of the processing of personal data
(hereinafter referred to as âDataâ) within our online offering and the related websites, features
and content, as well as external online presence, e.g. our social media profiles on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and similar sites
(collectively referred to as âonline presenceâ).

## 2. Collection and storage of personal data and the nature and purpose of their use

### a) When visiting the website

#### Log files

When you visit our websites ([full list of domains](/policies/asf-domains.html)) or one of our subdomains,
the browser on your device automatically sends information to the server of our website.
This information is temporarily stored in a log file.
The following information is being collected without your intervention and stored until automated deletion:

* The IP address of the requesting computer
* The date and time of access
* The name and URL of the retrieved file
* The website from which access is made (referrer URL)
* Geo information of the location from which access is made
* The browser used and, if applicable, the operating system of your computer and the name of your access provider

The data mentioned are processed by us for the following purposes:

* Ensuring connectivity of our website
* Ensuring a use of our website, of which we think is comfortable for you
* Evaluation of system security and stability
* Other administrative purposes

The retention time for this data is 90 days.

The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f GDPR.
Our legitimate interest follows from the data collection purposes listed above.
In no case do we use the collected data for the purpose of drawing conclusions about you.
In addition, we use cookies and analysis services when you visit our website.
Further details can be found under no. 4 and 5 of this privacy policy.

#### Matomo

In addition to log files, some of our websites use Matomo to understand what parts of the
website are important to our users, what features are most frequently accessed,
where users get lost in the documentation, etc.
This data allows us to better understand how users use the system, the website,
and the docs and where to focus improvements next.

The collected information consists of the following:

* The IP address from which you access the website
* The type of browser and operating system you use to access our site
* The date and time you access our site
* The pages you visit
* If you click on any of the file download links on our website
* The addresses of pages from where you followed a link to our site
* The addresses of pages you go to from our site
* The search terms you use on the website

This information is gathered and stored using the open source software Matomo. We donât
use any cookies to collect this information. An IP address is anonymized by removing
the last two octets from the IP address. That means that if your IP is 192.168.100.50,
we store it as 192.168.0.0.

Matomo is self-hosted on a virtual machine provided by the Apache Software Foundation.
It can only be accessed by members of the Apache Privacy committee. The data can be
viewed by anyone by visiting https://analytics.apache.org/.

Matomo respects any Do Not Track setting in your browser. You can also opt-out
from all Matomo tracking below.

### b) When registering for our newsletter and mailing lists

If, pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, you have expressly consented,
we use your e-mail address to periodically send you our newsletter.
For the receipt of the newsletter the indication of an e-mail address is sufficient.

We inform our visitors at regular intervals through newsletters about news and offers from The Apache Software Foundation.

The newsletter of our Foundation can only be received if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers for the newsletter.
For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by an affected person before the first time of sending the newsletter, using the double-opt-in procedure.
This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address is the person who authorized the receipt of the newsletter.

When you subscribe to the newsletter, we store the date and time of registration and the email address.
The collection of this data is necessary for us to understand the (possible) misuse of an affected personâs e-mail address at a later date and therefore serves as legal safeguards for the controller.

The personal data collected in the context of registering for the newsletter is used exclusively to send our newsletter.

Subscribers may also be notified by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or registration, as might be the case in the event of changes to the newsletter/mailing list or technical changes.

There will be no transfer to third parties of the personal data collected as part of the newsletter service.

Subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the person concerned at any time.
Consent to the storage of personal data that the person has given us for the newsletter dispatch can be revoked at any time.
For the purpose of revoking the consent, instructions are given by the end of each newsletter email.

### c) When registering for our mailing lists

If, pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, you have expressly consented, we use your e-mail address to send you messages arriving at our mailing lists.
For the receipt of the mailing list message the indication of an e-mail address is sufficient.

Visitors may communicate with us through our mailing lists.

The mailing list messages of our organisation can only be received if (1) the person concerned has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers for the mailing list.
For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by an affected person for the first time using the double-opt-in procedure.
This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address authorized the receipt of the mailing list messages.

When you subscribe to a mailing list, we store the date and time of registration and the email address.
The collection of this data is necessary for us to understand the (possible) misuse of an affected personâs e-mail address at a later date and therefore serves as legal safeguards for the controller.
When a mailing list is archived, the log file will be deleted.

The personal data collected in the context of registering for a mailing list will be used exclusively to send messages arriving at that mailing list.

Subscribers may also be notified by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the mailing list service or registration, as might be the case in the event of changes to the mailing list or other technical changes.

We will not actively transfer to third parties any personal data as part of the mailing list service.
However, almost all of our mailing lists are of a public nature.

This means, your name and email may be exposed to the public.
Also, all information you send to a mailing list will be exposed to the public.
Third parties may collect this information and process it separately.
The sender of messages is responsible if they expose their personal data to the public.

All content sent to mailing lists is archived indefinitely.
By using our mailing list service, you agree that any content is archived in that way.

Subscription to our mailing lists may be terminated by the person concerned at any time.
The consent to the storage of personal data that a person has given us for the mailing list dispatch can be revoked at any time.
For the purpose of revoking the consent, instructions are given by the end of every email.

## 3. Disclosure of data

Transfer of your personal data to third parties for purposes other than those listed below does not take place.
We only share your personal information with third parties if:

* You, in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a GDPR, have given express consent to this.
* Disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR is required to assert, exercise or defend legal claims and there is no reason to assume that you have a predominantly legitimate interest in not disclosing your data.
* Disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR is a legal obligation.
* As permitted by law and according to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR, disclosure is required for the settlement of contractual relationships with you.

## 4. External service providers

The Apache Software Foundation uses the following external service providers who help to optimize its services.
Insofar as these service providers process data on behalf of The Apache Software Foundation, agreements have been concluded with them which set the European data protection standards as binding and, in particular, prohibit the use of the data for other purposes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## CVE-2007-4770/4771

### Manipulated ODF text documents containing XForms can lead to heap overflows and arbitrary code execution

* **Synopsis:**Manipulated ODF text documents containing
  XForms can lead to heap overflows and arbitrary code execution
* **State:** Resolved

#### 1. Impact

A security vulnerability with the way OpenOffice.org 2 processes ODF
text documents with XForms, using the 3rd party library ICU, may allow a
remote unprivileged user who provides a OpenOffice.org document that is
opened by a local user to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the
privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org. No working exploit is known
right now.

#### 2. Affected releases

All versions prior to OpenOffice.org 2.4

#### 3. Symptoms

There are no predictable symptoms that would indicate this issue has
occurred

#### 4. Relief/Workaround

There is no workaround. See "Resolution" below.

#### 5. Resolution

This issue is addressed in the following release:

**OpenOffice.org 2.4**

# International Components for Unicode: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200803-20**

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in the International Components
for Unicode, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code
or a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/icu** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.8.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.8.1-r1**revision >= **3.6-r2** |

### Background

International Components for Unicode is a set of C/C++ and Java
libraries providing Unicode and Globalization support for software
applications.

### Description

Will Drewry (Google Security) reported a vulnerability in the regular
expression engine when using back references to capture \0 characters
(CVE-2007-4770). He also found that the backtracking stack size is not
limited, possibly allowing for a heap-based buffer overflow
(CVE-2007-4771).

### Impact

A remote attacker could submit specially crafted regular expressions to
an application using the library, possibly resulting in the remote
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application or a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All International Components for Unicode users should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/icu-3.8.1-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
