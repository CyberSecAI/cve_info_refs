---------------------------------------------------
| Vendor | Nullsoft's Winamp (Lite) |
| URL | http://www.winamp.com/ |
| Version | <= 5.35 |
| Risk | Low (Denial Of Service) |
---------------------------------------------------
o Description:
=============
Winamp is a proprietary media player for Windows systems. Visit
http://www.winamp.com/ for detailed information.
o Denial Of Service:
===================
The M3U file format allows it to include local and remote files by
simply specifing the path to the desired file. Furthermore Winamp does
not check if the M3U file to include is the currently processed M3U
file wherefore it's possible to force Winamp to recursively read a
certain M3U file. Winamp allocates memory by each iteration which
leads to a stack overflow exception (0xc00000fd).
You are able to simply test this bug yourself by creating a file named
'a.m3u' with the content 'a.m3u'. If you are using the standard version
of Winamp (not the Lite version) you just have to add the M3U file to
Winamp by for example simply dragging the file into the playlist.
The lite version catches the exception and exits if you add the
malformed M3U file to the playlist. If you use the "Enqueue in Winamp"
option (if configured you'll find it in the context menu) Winamp Lite
does not catch the exception and crashes too.
It's also possible to add a remote file to the playlist by clicking
on Add -> Add URL and inserting a URL like:
http://morph3us.org/security/pen-testing/winamp/a.m3u
These are the register values and the ASM dump at the time of the stack
overflow exception:

> How would you name it? "Winamp 5.35 (Infinite) M3U File Inclusion Stack
> Overflow Exception"?
I actually agree with the original poster. A stack overflow in a client side
program such as winamp could hardly be labeled 'denial of service'. A user
program is in general not 'a service'. With your definition every segfault
could be labeled 'denial of service'.
In any case, I liked your new title much better because it is more accurate
and does not sound as threatening to server administrators as your original
one :)
With kind regards,
