  "CVE-2007-4425": {
    "details": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Live for Speed <= 0.5X10, including:\n\n*   **A] Nickname buffer overflow:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code handling client nicknames from packets with ID 3. By providing a nickname longer than 24 bytes, an attacker can overwrite subsequent fields within the packet.\n*   **B] Partial track buffer overflow:** A buffer overflow exists in packets with ID 10. While the return address is overwritten with a fixed string, this can still cause a crash. This occurs when a user requests a track not available on the host.\n*   **C] NULL pointer access:** S1/S2 servers running in internet or hidden mode are vulnerable to a crash due to a NULL pointer access. This is triggered by sending a packet with a byte 0x00 at data offset 23 in a pre-login packet with ID 3. Demo and LAN servers are not affected.\n*   **D] memcpy() NULL pointer:** S1/S2 servers running in internet or hidden mode can crash due to a `memcpy()` call with a NULL source. This is caused by the absence of certain strings in a pre-login packet with ID 5. Demo and LAN servers are not affected.",
