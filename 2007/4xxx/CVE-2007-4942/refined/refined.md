  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `CategoryBreakdownTime.php` and `StudentFieldBreakdown.php` files. These files include another PHP script based on a user-controlled parameter called `FocusPath` without proper sanitization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
        "Lack of Input Validation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include an arbitrary PHP file from a remote server controlled by them, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request with the `FocusPath` parameter set to a malicious PHP file URL."
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They need to host a malicious PHP file on a server accessible to the vulnerable application."
