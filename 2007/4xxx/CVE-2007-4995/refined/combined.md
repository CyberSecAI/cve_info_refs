DTLS is a datagram variant of TLS specified in RFC 4347 first supported in OpenSSL version 0.9.8. Note that the vulnerabilities do not affect SSL and TLS so only clients and servers explicitly using DTLS are affected.  We believe this flaw will permit remote code execution.  This vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2007-4995.  Versions Affected - -----------------  All releases of 0.9.8 prior to 0.9.8f.  Recommendation - --------------  Either  a) Upgrade to the latest version of OpenSSL (0.9.8f) and rebuild all packages using OpenSSL for DTLS.  or,  b) Disable DTLS.  Vulnerability B - ---------------  Moritz Jodeit found an off-by-one error in SSL_get_shared_ciphers(), a function that should normally only be used for logging or debugging.  The impact of this overflow is unclear.  This vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2007-5135.  Versions Affected - -----------------  All releases of 0.9.8 prior to 0.9.8f. All releases of 0.9.7 prior to 0.9.7m.  (Note that versions prior to 0.9.8d and 0.9.7l actually had a worse problem in the same function).  Recommendation - --------------  a) Don't use SSL_get_shared_ciphers().  OR  b) Upgrade to 0.9.8f.  - -- <http://www.apache-ssl.org/ben.html>           <http://www.links.org/>  "There is no limit to what a man can do or how far he can go if he doesn't mind who gets the credit." - Robert Woodruff -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.2.5 (MingW32) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - <http://enigmail.mozdev.org>  iQCVAwUBRw9VDBsIDEUnGa81AQEgFAP+MBSAb2CYGHXe0eicqsn3CRVE3R384PoC 01odYyJIdzjXrmgUxKZ0zaKst2Ud2BbNZff1WUDj3oymjc5wbylE2tQLK7KsetRv hpfFwKmwbiLmhYtei+CVXOQiO+inOPeS9KbDbOqE40wrD9yMShJfpJXE7OG/Mf5t 8+l8pKLYag0= =mVOD -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2007-10-13 02:36:23 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 195674](show_bug.cgi?id=195674 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - dev-libs/openssl: OpenSSL DTLS Implementation Vulnerability") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-13 12:08:15 UTC  ``` CVE-2007-5135 was adressed with GLSA 200710-06.

# OpenSSL: Remote execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200710-30**

OpenSSL contains a vulnerability allowing execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.8f** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.8f** |

### Background

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general
purpose cryptography library.

### Description

Andy Polyakov reported a vulnerability in the OpenSSL toolkit, that is
caused due to an unspecified off-by-one error within the DTLS
implementation.

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code or
cause a Denial of Service. Only clients and servers explicitly using
DTLS are affected, systems using SSL and TLS are not.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8f"
```

#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

Package        : openssl
Vulnerability  : predictable random number generator
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: yes
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-0166

Luciano Bello discovered that the random number generator in Debian's
openssl package is predictable.  This is caused by an incorrect
Debian-specific change to the openssl package (CVE-2008-0166).  As a
result, cryptographic key material may be guessable.

This is a Debian-specific vulnerability which does not affect other
operating systems which are not based on Debian.  However, other systems
can be indirectly affected if weak keys are imported into them.

It is strongly recommended that all cryptographic key material which has
been generated by OpenSSL versions starting with 0.9.8c-1 on Debian
systems is recreated from scratch.  Furthermore, all DSA keys ever used
on affected Debian systems for signing or authentication purposes should
be considered compromised; the Digital Signature Algorithm relies on a
secret random value used during signature generation.

The first vulnerable version, 0.9.8c-1, was uploaded to the unstable
distribution on 2006-09-17, and has since propagated to the testing and
current stable (etch) distributions.  The old stable distribution
(sarge) is not affected.

Affected keys include SSH keys, OpenVPN keys, DNSSEC keys, and key
material for use in X.509 certificates and session keys used in SSL/TLS
connections.  Keys generated with GnuPG or GNUTLS are not affected,
though.

A detector for known weak key material will be published at:

  <<http://security.debian.org/project/extra/dowkd/dowkd.pl.gz>>
  <<http://security.debian.org/project/extra/dowkd/dowkd.pl.gz.asc>>
    (OpenPGP signature)

Instructions how to implement key rollover for various packages will be
published at:

  <<http://www.debian.org/security/key-rollover/>>

This web site will be continously updated to reflect new and updated
instructions on key rollovers for packages using SSL certificates.
Popular packages not affected will also be listed.

In addition to this critical change, two other vulnerabilities have been
fixed in the openssl package which were originally scheduled for release
with the next etch point release: OpenSSL's DTLS (Datagram TLS,
basically "SSL over UDP") implementation did not actually implement the
DTLS specification, but a potentially much weaker protocol, and
contained a vulnerability permitting arbitrary code execution
(CVE-2007-4995).  A side channel attack in the integer multiplication
routines is also addressed (CVE-2007-3108).

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.8c-4etch3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution
(lenny), these problems have been fixed in version 0.9.8g-9.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl package and subsequently
regenerate any cryptographic material, as outlined above.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Linux Terminal Server Project: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200805-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in components shipped with
LTSP which allow remote attackers to compromise terminal clients.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/ltsp** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.0** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

The Linux Terminal Server Project adds thin-client support to Linux
servers.

### Description

LTSP version 4.2, ships prebuilt copies of programs such as the Linux
Kernel, the X.org X11 server (GLSA 200705-06, GLSA 200710-16, GLSA
200801-09), libpng (GLSA 200705-24, GLSA 200711-08), Freetype (GLSA
200705-02, GLSA 200705-22) and OpenSSL (GLSA 200710-06, GLSA 200710-30)
which were subject to multiple security vulnerabilities since 2006.
Please note that the given list of vulnerabilities might not be
exhaustive.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly exploit vulnerabilities in the
aforementioned programs and execute arbitrary code, disclose sensitive
data or cause a Denial of Service within LTSP 4.2 clients.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

LTSP 4.2 is not maintained upstream in favor of version 5. Since
version 5 is not yet available in Gentoo, the package has been masked.
We recommend that users unmerge LTSP:

```
 # emerge --unmerge net-misc/ltsp
```

If you have a requirement for Linux Terminal Servers, please either set
up a terminal server by hand or use one of the distributions that
already migrated to LTSP 5. If you want to contribute to the
integration of LTSP 5 in Gentoo, or want to follow its development,
find details in bug 177580.

SUSE Security Summary Report
Announcement ID: SUSE-SR:2007:021
Date: Fri, 19 Oct 2007 17:00:00 +0000
Cross-References: CVE-2006-1861, CVE-2006-3467, CVE-2007-4074
CVE-2007-4224, CVE-2007-4569, CVE-2007-4924

- hplip command injection
- kdelibs3, kdebase3 security update
- NX security update for PCF handling
- festival daemon command injection
- opal denial of service problem
- openssl DTLS problem
2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds:

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- hplip command injection
The daemon 'hpssd' could be exploited by users to execute arbitrary
commands as root. hpssd only runs on systems that have HP all-in-one
devices configured. In the default configuration the problem is
not remotely exploitable as hpssd only listens on local interfaces
(CVE-2007-5208).
This issue has been fixed for SUSE Linux 10.0-10.3, and SUSE Linux
Enterprise Desktop 10.
- kdelibs3, kdebase3 security update
kdebase3 and kdelibs3 were updated on all affected SUSE Linux
products to fix the following problems:
- Users could log in as root without having to enter the password
if auto login was enabled and if kdm was configured to require
the root password to shutdown the system (CVE-2007-4569).
- Javascript code could modify the URL in the address bar to make
the currently displayed web site appear to come from a different
site (CVE-2007-4224).
- NX security update for PCF handling
The XFree code contained in NX was prone to integer overflows
(CVE-2006-1861) and insufficiently protected against specially
crafted PCF files (CVE-2006-3467).
NX has been updated on SUSE Linux 10.0-10.3, it is not contained
on other distributions.
- festival daemon command injection
The festival daemon runs as root (if started). The default config
doesn't have a password set. A local attacker could therefore connect
to the daemon to have commands executed as root (CVE-2007-4074).
festival has been updated on all affected products.
- opal denial of service problem
The opal library contained a bug in the SIP protocol handler that
could be exploited by attackers to crash applications using opal
(CVE-2007-4924).
Opal has been updated on openSUSE 10.2, 10.3 and SUSE Linux
Desktop 10.
- openssl DTLS problem
A buffer overflow in the DTLS implementation of openssl could
be exploited by attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2007-4995).
openssl has been updated on all distributions that contain DTLS
support.
It is questionable if the DTLS support even worked before or used
by applications at all, so we were likely not affected.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

### [amd64 – Advanced choices](#amd64-advanced)

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

The *amd64* architecture is intended for use on AMD 64-bit CPUs as well as 64-bit **Intel Pentium/Core/Xeon** processors.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
