Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The SAXON news publishing system has flaws in its scripts that lead to PHP warnings and fatal errors, which expose the server's internal file paths. Specifically, the use of undefined functions (like `quotesmart()`) and improper handling of input (passing an array to `mysql_real_escape_string()`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Disclosure:** The application displays the full server path of the script in error messages when encountering issues. This occurs due to a combination of not handling errors gracefully, and not sanitizing input.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** The code doesn't properly validate and sanitize input, which results in errors when an unexpected type of input (e.g., array instead of a string) is provided.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain sensitive information about the server's file system structure, including the installation path of the SAXON application. This can aid in further reconnaissance or exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploitable through crafted HTTP requests to the `news.php` and `admin/edit-item.php` scripts. Specific examples are provided in the content, including triggering undefined function errors and passing array types to functions expecting strings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content gives more detail than the typical CVE description, including examples of how to trigger the path disclosure through specific HTTP requests.
*   The vulnerability is in SAXON version 5.4, and the vendor released version 5.41 to address it.
*   The advisory provides several workarounds, including disabling error messages in PHP, turning off `register_globals` and updating critical files with MySQL error reporting removed.
*   The CVSS v2 score for this vulnerability is 5.0 (Medium), with an exploitability subscore of 10 (High) and impact score of 2.9.
