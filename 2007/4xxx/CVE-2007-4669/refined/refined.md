Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4669:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that ordinary users could access the server log through the services API. This access control issue allowed unauthorized viewing of sensitive information contained within the log files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access controls for the services API, which allows ordinary users to access server logs.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The exposure of server logs can reveal sensitive information about the database server's operations, potential vulnerabilities, and configuration details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain access to potentially sensitive information contained in the server logs. This could include details about database operations, errors, configuration, and possibly user information depending on the logging level.
*   **Security Risk:** While the issue is considered a "minor security problem", information gleaned from the logs could assist an attacker in planning further attacks or identifying other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Services API:** An attacker could exploit the services API by using a standard database connection with ordinary user privileges to request the server logs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Database User:** An attacker needs to have a valid user account on the Firebird database instance, though it does not require administrator privileges.
*   **Database Connection:** An attacker needs the ability to connect to the database using the Firebird services API.

**Additional Notes**

*   The issue was identified as CORE1148 internally within the Firebird project.
*   The vulnerability was present in Firebird versions 1.5.0, 2.0.0 and 2.1 Alpha 1.
*   The issue was fixed in Firebird version 2.0.2 and 2.1 Alpha 1.
*   The Debian security advisory DSA-1529-1 mentioned CVE-2007-4669 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in the updated firebird2.0 packages.
*   The fix was implemented through commits [0d7eb34](https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/0d7eb3423165b9773dc578a8fe777c92dc24cad0) and [60e06d5](https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/60e06d5c99d22c272e8cece9a50a21084fc8cf6f).
