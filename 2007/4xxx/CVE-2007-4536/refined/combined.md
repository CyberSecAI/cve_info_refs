How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# [VIM] uh-oh: local file inclusion from insecure permissions

Ref: CONFIRM:<http://www.torrenttrader.org/index.php?showtopic=5843>

(CVE pending)

The ACK says "We have been made aware of a hole in the script that can
be exploited. Please CHMOD your .txt files in the root back to 644 to
disable write access (you can edit them via FTP still) ...
disclaimer.txt ... sponsors.txt ... banners.txt ... we are working to
address this issue ...."

Source inspection of 1.07, as downloaded on 20070824, shows that these
files have 640 permissions, at least as extracted from the tarball.

So, we were asking ourselves... why is modifying these files a
security issue, and what's the attack vector?  Maybe local symlink
following, but then I'd think they'd say change the directory
permissions too.

Ah, grep, you wondrous workhorse of post-disclosure analysis:

>  grep banners.txt *.php

  admin.php:      include("banners.txt");
  ....
  check.php:$banners = chmod($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . "/banners.txt", 0666);
  check.php:      if(!$banners){ echo "banners.txt - Error setting
       permissions<br>"; } else { echo "banners.txt - Success! CHMOD
       CHANGED<br>"; }
  check.php:If you see "Unwriteable" you need to change the permissions
       on the file or directory to 777 or 666 so that  TorrentTrader to write
       to it.

So... a text file is given world-writable permissions, but it's used
in an include statement.  So, at least, we have a locally exploitable
"file inclusion" issue thanks to insecure permissions.

We see similar things for sponsors.txt and disclaimer.txt, but grep
also yields this tidbit:

  index.php:echo file_get_contents("disclaimer.txt") ;

So, this is a way to do local "file inclusion" for any visitor to the
site.

I didn't investigate whether there were remote attack vectors.

I bet there's a TON of these kinds of "writable-LFI" issues out
there...

- Steve
