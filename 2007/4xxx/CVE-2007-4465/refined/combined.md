# Apache: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200711-06**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apache, possibly resulting
in a Denial of Service or the disclosure of sensitive information.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.6** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **2.0.59-r5**>= **2.2.6** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP server is one of the most popular web servers on the
Internet.

### Description

Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been discovered in
mod\_status and mod\_autoindex (CVE-2006-5752, CVE-2007-4465). An error
has been discovered in the recall\_headers() function in mod\_mem\_cache
(CVE-2007-1862). The mod\_cache module does not properly sanitize
requests before processing them (CVE-2007-1863). The Prefork module
does not properly check PID values before sending signals
(CVE-2007-3304). The mod\_proxy module does not correctly check headers
before processing them (CVE-2007-3847).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit one of these vulnerabilities to inject
arbitrary script or HTML content, obtain sensitive information or cause
a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.59-r5"
```

enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

\* You can avoid this vulnerability by the coping in "3-3. Workaround" below.

(note) These patches only address "Problem 2" shown in "1. Description". Therefore please apply the workaround shown in "3-3. Workaround" for "Problem 1".

Note: Determining the affected product

To check the software version, refer to the "FUJITSU SOFTWARE RELEASE GUIDE" supplied with the product.

### 3-3. Workaround

* Problem 1)

  To avoid the problem, edit the environment definition file (httpd.conf) in one of the following ways. After the file is edited, Interstage HTTP Server must be restarted.
  + 1-1)

    If "Indexes" has been set in Options directive, the automatic directory list generation function is disabled by deleting "Indexes".
  + 1-2)

    Avoid the problem by setting the explicit contents character set.

    Example:

    If the contents type is text/plain or text/html and the character set of the contents is UTF-8, set utf-8 in the AddDefaultCharset directive.

    Specification example: AddDefaultCharset utf-8

    Note:

    In environments in which multiple contents character sets are mixed together, characters may be garbled. In this case, avoid the problem by following the procedure in 1-1).
* Problem 2)

  Avoid the problem by editing the environment definition file (httpd.conf) with the following method and setting the error message of the status code 413 to a text message. After editing the file, Interstage HTTP Server must be restarted.
  + For [a] products:

    Specify the text message after double quotation marks (").

    Specification example: ErrorDocument 413 "413 Request Entity Too Large
  + For [b] products:

    Enclose the text message in double quotation marks (").

    Specification example: ErrorDocument 413 "413 Request Entity Too Large"

## 4. Related information

* CVE-2007-4465

  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in mod\_autoindex.c in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.2.6, when the charset on a server-generated page is not defined, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the P parameter using the UTF-7 charset. NOTE: it could be argued that this issue is due to a design limitation of browsers that attempt to perform automatic content type detection.

  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4465>
* CVE-2007-6203

  Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x and 2.2.x does not sanitize the HTTP Method specifier header from an HTTP request when it is reflected back in a "413 Request Entity Too Large" error message, which might allow cross-site scripting (XSS) style attacks using web client components that can send arbitrary headers in requests, as demonstrated via an HTTP request containing an invalid Content-length value, a similar issue to CVE-2006-3918.

  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6203>

# USN-575-1: Apache vulnerabilities

4 February 2008

Apache vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [apache2](/security/cves?package=apache2) -

## Details

It was discovered that Apache did not sanitize the Expect header from

an HTTP request when it is reflected back in an error message, which

could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting

attacks when processing the output. With cross-site scripting

vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output

during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this

to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords),

within the same domain. This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 6.06.

([CVE-2006-3918](/security/CVE-2006-3918))

It was discovered that when configured as a proxy server and using a

threaded MPM, Apache did not properly sanitize its input. A remote

attacker could send Apache crafted date headers and cause a denial of

service via application crash. By default, mod\_proxy is disabled in

Ubuntu. ([CVE-2007-3847](/security/CVE-2007-3847))

It was discovered that mod\_autoindex did not force a character set,

which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site

scripting attacks when processing the output. ([CVE-2007-4465](/security/CVE-2007-4465))

It was discovered that mod\_imap/mod\_imagemap did not force a

character set, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable

to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output. By

default, mod\_imap/mod\_imagemap is disabled in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2007-5000](/security/CVE-2007-5000))

It was discovered that mod\_status when status pages were available,

allowed for cross-site scripting attacks. By default, mod\_status is

disabled in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2007-6388](/security/CVE-2007-6388))

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_balancer did not sanitize its input,

which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site

scripting attacks when processing the output. By default,

mod\_proxy\_balancer is disabled in Ubuntu. This was only vulnerable

in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-6421](/security/CVE-2007-6421))

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_balancer could be made to

dereference a NULL pointer. A remote attacker could send a crafted

request and cause a denial of service via application crash. By

default, mod\_proxy\_balancer is disabled in Ubuntu. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-6422](/security/CVE-2007-6422))

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ftp did not force a character set,

which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site

scripting attacks when processing the output. By default,

mod\_proxy\_ftp is disabled in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2008-0005](/security/CVE-2008-0005))

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
