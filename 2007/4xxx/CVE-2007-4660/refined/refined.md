```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `chunk_split` function in PHP did not correctly handle long strings, leading to an integer overflow during size calculation.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Integer overflow.
- Impact of exploitation: Remote attackers could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with application privileges.
- Attack vectors: A remote attacker could send a specially crafted string to a PHP application that utilizes the `chunk_split` function.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send data to a vulnerable PHP application that makes use of the vulnerable function.
