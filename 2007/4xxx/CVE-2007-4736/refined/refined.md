Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Blind SQL Injection** found in the `category.php` file of the CKGold Shopping Cart version 2.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The `category.php` script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `manufacturer_id` and `category_id` parameters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query executed by the script.
*   The blind nature of the SQL injection implies that the attacker does not see the direct output of their queries. Instead, they must rely on timing or other side-channel effects (in this case, the presence of the `<th>Products</th>` string in the response) to infer information about the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database by using SQL injection queries, as demonstrated by the provided exploit code that targets the `admin_password` from the `tbl_system` table.
*   The attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the application by obtaining credentials and further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a web request to the vulnerable `category.php` script.
*   Specifically, the attacker crafts a malicious URL with modified `manufacturer_id` and `category_id` parameters containing the SQL injection payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the vulnerability is present in a publicly accessible page.
*   The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL to craft the injection queries, as well as knowledge of the vulnerable applicationâ€™s schema in order to target the right tables and columns.

**Additional Details from Exploit Code:**

*   The provided exploit code is a Perl script that automates the extraction of the admin password using a character-by-character approach.
*   The script uses a boolean-based blind SQL injection technique, where the injected query uses the `SUBSTRING` function and character code comparison to extract the password character-by-character, verifying its correctness based on the presence of `<th>Products</th>` in the response.
*   The script can optionally use a proxy, and it allows specification of the manufacturer and category IDs as well as the table name.

**More Detail Than CVE:**

The provided content gives more detail than the CVE description by:

*   Identifying the specific vulnerable file: `category.php`.
*   Providing a working exploit script and describing the exploitation technique used, which is a blind SQL injection based on the presence of a certain string.
*   Describing the specific table (`tbl_system`) and column (`admin_password`) targeted by the exploit.
*   Specifying that the vulnerability exists within the user-supplied parameters `manufacturer_id` and `category_id`
