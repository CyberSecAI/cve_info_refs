    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a crafted image file (e.g., DCM, DIB, XBM, XCF, XWD, etc).",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick a user or automated system into processing the malicious image file. No specific user interaction is required other than opening the file using the vulnerable application.",
     "additional_notes": "The vulnerability resides in how ImageMagick processes image files, specifically due to an off-by-one error when reading a blob string and writing a null terminator. This could cause a write of \\0 byte outside the allocated buffer."
