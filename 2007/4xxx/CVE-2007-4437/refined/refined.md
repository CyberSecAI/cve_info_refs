*   **Session Fixation:** An attacker can steal a user's session and gain unauthorized access to the application with the privileges of the compromised user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Sending malicious input through the "match" parameter in `albums.php`.
*   **Session Fixation:** Crafting a special link and tricking a user into logging in through it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*  **Session Fixation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and trick a user into clicking on it and logging in.
