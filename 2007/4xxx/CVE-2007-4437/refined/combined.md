| [Description](#c0)  Matt Fleming (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-08-20 15:45:35 UTC  ``` Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Ampache, which can be exploited by malicious users to conduct SQL injection attacks and by malicious people to conduct session fixation attacks.  1) Input passed to the "match" parameter in albums.php is not properly sanitised before being used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.  2) An error in the session handling code can be exploited to hijack another user's session by tricking the user into logging in after following a specially crafted link.  The vulnerabilities are reported in versions prior to 3.3.3.5. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Matt Fleming (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-08-20 15:47:49 UTC  ``` CC'ing maintainers and setting whiteboard status. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-08-31 10:11:39 UTC  ``` web-apps, version 3.3.3.5 is in the tree, is it ready for going stable? please advise. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Gunnar Wrobel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-03 06:56:18 UTC  ``` Yes, it is ready.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

### Description

LT discovered that the "match" parameter in albums.php is not properly
sanitized before being processed. The Ampache development team also
reported an error when handling user sessions.

### Impact

A remote attacker could provide malicious input to the application,
possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary SQL code. He could
also entice a user to open a specially crafted link to steal the user's
session.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Ampache users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/ampache-3.3.3.5"
```
