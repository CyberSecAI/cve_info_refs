```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Improper sanitization of the 'ip' parameter in the tracking.php script.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML, potentially leading to malicious actions on the user's browser when they visit a page where the vulnerable script is executed.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to tracking.php with the 'ip' parameter containing malicious JavaScript code.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required.
