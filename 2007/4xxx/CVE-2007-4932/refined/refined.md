    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-4932",
      "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the configuration appearance page allows for arbitrary PHP code injection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient input validation",
        "Code injection vulnerability"
      ],
       "impact": "Remote command execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by injecting malicious code into the configuration file.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the admin.php page with malicious PHP code in the productscount, colscount, and darkcolor parameters. This injected code will then be written to the configuration file and executed when the index.php page is accessed with a 'cmd' parameter.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have access to the Shop-Script FREE application and be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server where the application is installed. No authentication is needed because the authentication check can be bypassed."
