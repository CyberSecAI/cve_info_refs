Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a defect in InterSystems Cache' that allows a malicious user to potentially make data changes on the server. This defect is related to how user-passed parameter values via CSP (Cache Server Pages) are handled, specifically when encoded by login page redirection logic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of user-supplied parameters in CSP applications.
- Vulnerability exists in the login page redirection logic which results in improper encoding of user-supplied parameter values.
- The system management portal, being a CSP application, is also vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Malicious users could make unauthorized data changes on the server.
- The system management portal in Cache' is vulnerable meaning administrative functions may be exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User-passed parameters via CSP.
- Exploiting the login page redirection logic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the CSP application and manipulate parameters.
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the login page and trigger the vulnerable redirection logic.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in Cache' versions 2007.1.0.369.0 and 2007.1.1.420.0. Versions prior to Cache' 2007.1 are not affected.
- The specific details of how to reproduce the vulnerability are not provided for security reasons.
- A patch (MAK2116) is available to correct the vulnerability either as a hotfix or in the latest release.
