Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Type:** Arbitrary File Upload and Local File Inclusion
*   **Affected Software:** Pakupaku CMS 0.4

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from two issues within the Pakupaku CMS 0.4 application.
    1.  **Arbitrary File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files without proper validation or sanitization, enabling the upload of malicious files (e.g., PHP shells). Specifically the `index.php?page=Uploads` page is vulnerable.
    2.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application is vulnerable to local file inclusion by manipulating the `page` parameter. By injecting the path to a log file using null byte termination, an attacker can include malicious code embedded in the log file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure File Upload:** Lack of proper checks on uploaded files allows for arbitrary file uploads.
*   **Local File Inclusion:** The `page` parameter in `index.php` is vulnerable to local file inclusion through path traversal and null byte injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a PHP shell and then executing it via either a direct request to the uploads folder or through the LFI, an attacker can gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Compromised System:** Successful exploitation can lead to full system compromise, allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, install backdoors, and gain complete control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Arbitrary File Upload:**
    *   The attacker accesses the upload functionality of the application, typically through a URL like `[Path_Script]/index.php?page=Uploads`.
    *   The attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a PHP shell) with an executable extension.
    *   The attacker then accesses the uploaded shell in the `/uploads/` directory, directly or through the LFI.

2.  **Local File Inclusion:**
    *   The attacker identifies a web server log file accessible via LFI using a null byte injection with `index.php?page=[path_to_log_file]%00`.
    *  The attacker injects malicious code into an HTTP request to have it written in web server logs.
    *   The attacker triggers the malicious code embedded in the log file by including the log file in the vulnerable page via LFI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the application's file upload functionality.
*   For Local File Inclusion, the attacker needs to be able to access a vulnerable file through a known path on the server's filesystem (log files are typical targets)

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The provided exploit code includes a list of common Apache log file locations for the LFI vulnerability.
*   The exploit leverages the PHP `system()` function to execute commands, controlled via the `cmd` parameter in the HTTP request.
*   The exploit uses a null byte injection (`%00`) to truncate the file path during the LFI attempt to bypass any file extension checks.

The exploit also covers some common web server log file paths, increasing the chance of successful exploitation.
