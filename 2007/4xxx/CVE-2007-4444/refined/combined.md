How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Bentley Continental GT3 dancing in the rain - rFactor 2 GT3 Pack

## rFactor

Presenting rFactor, the racing simulation series from Image Space Incorporated and now Studio 397. After successfully creating over a dozen products in the previous ten years, including the Formula One and NASCAR franchise games for EA Sports, Image Space took the next logical step in creating a completely new technology base and development process. This new isiMotor 2.0 environment became the foundation on which many exciting products were built for years to come.

The newest creation, rFactor 2, creates a dynamic racing environment that for the first time put you the driver into a racing simulator, instead of just a physics simulator. Changing tires, track surfaces, grip, weather and lighting make rFactor 2 a true challenge to any sim racer.

#### Which rFactor is right for me?

If you're looking for up-to-date visuals, advanced physics, first-party Studio 397-produced content, and licensed vehicles from major manufacturers and racing series, then [**rFactor 2**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/365960/rFactor_2/) is for you. Want access to a massive amount of third-party mods including dirt racing and drag racing, all working on the open rFactor modding platform? [**rFactor**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/339790/rFactor/) is what you should be looking at.

Both rFactor and rFactor 2 can be found on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=rfactor) (an online digital download games library).

Callaway Corvette C7 GT3-R - rFactor 2 GT3 Pack

## eSports

The 2017 Formula E Visa Vegas eRace had a $1,000,000 prize pool, and used rFactor 2 as their simulator. The event and $200,000 1st-place prize was won by Bono Huis, a five time rFactor Formula Sim Racing Champion.

McLaren's World's Fastest Gamer contest promised a role with the Formula 1 team as one of its official simulator drivers, and they used rFactor 2 for their opening and final rounds. The event and role at McLaren was won by Rudy van Buren, a qualifier from the rFactor 2 opening round.

While sim racing eSports are still an emerging field, it's obvious from the results so far that the rFactor 2 simulation platform gives the flexibility in content and features required. This is the simulator you need to take part in events like those above, or upcoming events organized by Studio 397 in a competitive competition structure now in-development.

## Support/Questions

rFactor support is handled by [ISI](http://imagespaceinc.com). rFactor 2 support is handled by [Studio 397](https://www.studio-397.com). Please try to select the correct address below:

rFactor: support@rfactor.net
rFactor 2: support@studio-397.com

**Frequently Asked Questions**

- Where can I purchase rFactor and rFactor 2?

Both titles are available on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=rfactor).

- Where do I download/install rFactor and rFactor 2?

Both titles are downloaded through the [Steam client](http://store.steampowered.com/about/) after you own them there. You need to install their software, select rFactor or rFactor 2 in your library and follow on-screen instructions to install it.

- I already purchased rFactor or rFactor 2 from ISI, can I transfer to Steam?

In most cases, yes. Please complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDJRK5xwh8GA70E6Ck-OyrjzpM1JRWeQfoANgznayNLjYYBw/viewform) once for each product you need a key for. Your purchase will be manually verified and we'll either send you a key or ask for more information from you as needed.

- I purchased an rFactor DVD, can I transfer to Steam?

It's unlikely. Please email support@rfactor.net and we will check what version you have.

- I purchased an rFactor DVD and it says 'insert correct DVD'?

Your DVD is being run on a version of Windows it was never designed for. Return it to the store.

- Can I get a refund for my purchase on Steam?

Refunds are handled by Steam, and in accordance with [their policy](http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/).

- Can the Steam version of rFactor be installed multiple times?

rFactor 2 does not need this. With rFactor, the easiest way to avoid mod conflicts in doing this is to install rFactor to a new Steam library folder, and make a backup of that steamapps/common/rfactor folder. Install your mod(s) and then you can move rFactor folders in and out of that location to activate or deactivate them. However it should be noted that some mods do include unnecessary files that WILL break your installation entirely, forcing you to reinstall. Nothing we can do about that. If you can contact the mod creator and inform them, perhaps they can remove the problematic files.

- I installed a mod and now rFactor says it needs to activate?

The mod replaced Steam files with non-Steam files and broke your installation. You'll have to remove that mod. We no longer even have a non-Steam version.

- How do I install mods?

With rFactor 2, use the Steam workshop where possible and just click subscribe on the item. With rFactor, we use loose files and a manual process where you simply drop the correct files into the correct folder. Most mods have a readme.txt file to help you with that.

- How do I create mods?

With rFactor 2 download and see guides on the [Studio 397 Web site](http://studio-397.com). With rFactor, you can download some of the tools here: [MAS Tool](downloads/mas_203.zip), [AIWCAM Editor](downloads/rFactorAIWCAMEditor1255.zip), [3DSMax Plugins](downloads/MaxPlugins.zip), [Older Tools](downloads/rFToolsPublicV2.zip). A 3D object creator is required along with a painting tool capable of DDS creation.

- Can I paint my cars?

Yes. We use DDS format, which requires the plugin for Photoshop from NVIDIA. [Download templates](downloads/templates.zip).

- rFactor doesn't detect my wheel?

You may have to manually bind controls for a wheel where they are not detected. Click an action in the settings, do the action with your controller.

- rFactor / rFactor 2 doesn't launch?

Either you have a bad mod (usually rF1 issue only), bad plugin, bad UI (rF1), are out of RAM, or are missing runtimes our software requires in order to run.

With rFactor 2, wherever you installed Steam look at the following paths for the files and install them all: steam/steamapps/common/rfactor 2/\_CommonRedist/

- Is the rFactor ISI matchmaker down?

rFactor is now Steam-only. Server listings are available in the Steam client. Hosts need to be using the Steam version for it to show there. IP direct connection is always available, and most leagues use that.

- How do I find the Steam server listings?

Open the Steam software. Go to the VIEW menu, then servers. Filter by game: rFactor.

- How do I launch the Steam dedicated server?

Open the Steam software. Right-click rFactor in your games library list and you will see a dedicated server option.

- Why are Studio 397 developing rFactor 2 instead of ISI?

ISI were beginning to wind down development on rF2 to focus on other projects. Studio 397 was formed to specifically give it back that focus and push it forwards.

- Can I use rFactor or rFactor 2 commercially?

Not without permission or commercial licensing. Contact ISI or Studio 397 to make sure you're operating legally.

- Is rFactor Pro available to retail customers?

No. Never has been. Pro is a controlled product for auto manufacturers, race car engineers and racing teams.

- Can I extract data (standings, telemetry, etc) from rFactor?

Yes. Our Internals Plugin system does this. [Download](downloads/InternalsPluginsV3.zip) (version 3). [Instructions PDF](downloads/rFactorInternalsPlugin.pdf), [Plugin example](downloads/rFactorExamplePlugin.zip).

1) Introduction
===============
rFactor is a racing game deeply focused on simulation.
It's developed by Image Space Incorporated
(http://www.imagespaceinc.com) and has been released in August 2005.
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
The game server listens on 3 ports:
- UDP 34247 used for queries
- UDP 34347 used for game packets
- TCP 34447 used for login, messages, race and other informations
Anyway the last two ports are very similar not only because they use
the same game protocol but just because they seem to work with the same
functions too, in fact all the bugs below can be exploited versus both
with the possibility of spoofing the source IP address in case of the
UDP port.
Another important thing is that the vulnerabilities can be exploited
without joining the server, so no password or banning limitations.
------------------
A] buffer-overflow
------------------
This bug is not only the most dangerous of those I have found but it's
also the most interesting.
A buffer-overflow vulnerability is located in the function which
handles the packets with ID 0x80 or 0x88 but no return address is
overwritten, in fact the bug allows the modification of some buffers in
the server included the one containing its version.
For exploting the bug we need to query the server (UDP port 34297)
where will happen a second buffer-overflow caused by the creation of a
reply using the too long server's version set by the attacker.
This is the moment in which the return address will be overwritten.
--------------------------
B] "Connection lost" crash
--------------------------
A packet with ID 0x30 or 0x38 causes the crash of the server (read of
memory at offset 0x00000004) after the visualization of the error
message "Connection lost".
--------------------------------
C] crash/possible code execution
--------------------------------
Unfortunately I wasn't able to retrieve more details about this bug so
for the moment I prefer to classify it only as a Denial of Service.
Anyway through packets with ID 0x60 and 0x68 which contain data about
the player (like his nickname, his car and so on) is possible to
specify a 13 bit number (max 0x1ffb) which is used by the server to
copy this amount of bytes from the received packet into another buffer.
If this amount is too big we will crash the server due to the read
access to the unallocated memory after the packet, while if we use a
lower amount the server will close (crash silenty) without no warnings.
In my opinion this second effect could be caused by the overwriting of
the return address but in this moment I don't have proofs for
confirming it.
---------------------
D] port 34397 blocked
---------------------
Packets with ID 0x20 and 0x28 instead leads to a strange and unusual
effect on the server, in short after having received this packet its
UDP port 34397 seems to become blocked and so nobody can join and play
on the server.

FPS in the spinner is low, and after exiting a session the FPS drops dramatically. Hmm, I'm not sure I like this patch at all. I hope it doesn't require a patch for each mod |

What is a .7z file? | | --- |  Google is your friend. All you had to do was look this up via any search engine. .7z is another archiving program like Winzip or Winrar. Most likely either Winzip or Winrar will extract a .7z archive IF you have one of the newer versions of those two programs.  And before people ask 'Why do they keep re-inventing the same type of programs?' Remember, if folks didn't keep trying to improve things...we'd still all be driving Model T Fords or using 640k of system ram with a 386 Intel cpu. Progress often means re-inventing the wheel.  dave henrie   \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ That Darn Dragon! RUSH R30 |

You also should be used to backing up your Trymedia License file...  If you had done this you wouldnt need to us an activation for the reinstall back to 1250.  Hell I havnt had to use an activation for MONTHS by backinng that file up....and it will be the first thing I do before trying this one as well.  Personally I have NO problems with this method....hell of a lot easier than Steam or Starforce. |
