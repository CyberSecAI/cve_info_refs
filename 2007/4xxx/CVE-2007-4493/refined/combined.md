### What is a Digital Experience Platform (DXP) and how does it differ from a Content Management System (CMS)?

"Designed to provide better customer experiences, Digital Experience Platforms (DXPs) are the natural evolution of your good old (or not so old) CMS, simply with much more functionality and seamless integrations giving you a new perspective in a world that has now fully pivoted to be customer-centric on all fronts."

[How a DXP is different from a CMS](https://www.ibexa.co/blog/what-is-a-digital-experience-platform-dxp-compared-to-a-content-management-system-cms)

### Where's eZ Platform?

Many of our visitors may be wondering [what is Ibexa DXP](/what-is-ibexa-dxp) and where is [eZ Platform](/ez-platform)?

The first iteration of [Ibexa DXP was released on October 26th 2020](https://www.ibexa.co/blog/product-launch-introducing-ibexa-dxp-3.2). The Ibexa DXP name essentially replaces the eZ Platform name. Going forward our products will be known by a different name, but this does not mean or change any commitments we have regarding product support.

For previous generation (eZ Platform) and legacy (eZ Publish) product documentation, please refer to: [eZ Platform 2.5](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/master/releases/ez_platform_v2.5/), [eZ Publish 5.x](https://doc.ez.no/display/EZP/eZ%2BPublish%2B5.x%2BDeveloper%2BDocumentation), [eZ Publish 4.](https://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
