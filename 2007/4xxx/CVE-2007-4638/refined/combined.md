Security Advisory
http://blog.hispasec.com/lab/
Name : Blizzard StarCraft Brood War Remote DoS
Class : Remote/Local DoS
Threat level : MED
Discovered : 2007-08-08
Published : 2007-08-29
Credit : Gynvael Coldwind
Vulnerable : StarCraft Brood War 1.15.1 and prior
StarCraft 1.15.1 and prior may also be affected
== Abstract ==
StarCraft is a real-time strategy game by Blizzard Entertainment.
StarCraft fails to handle exceptional conditions when generating a
minimap preview of a malformed map. Additionally, since StarCraft
includes a map distribution mechanizm (allowing players that do not
own a map to download it when entering a game) it is possible to send
a malformed map to a player that enters the game, and so, remotlly DoS
his application.
== Details ==
When a player enter a StarCraft Brood War game (local, lan game or an
Internet Battle.net game) a preview of the map is generated. If the
map was malformed StarCraft tries to read an area which is no
allocated. This leads to a Denial of Service condition, since
StarCraft generates a Access Volation (READ) exception which is not
handled.
Additionally, if a player enters a multiplayer game, and he does not
own a map that the game is taking place on, StarCraft download the map
from other players (not just the creator of the game). If StarCrafts
download a malformed map from a remote player, it will try to generate
a minimap and enter the DoS condition (this has been confirmed in
testing).
Since StarCraft is a full screen DirectX application a DoS may cause a
need to reboot the whole system on older Windows systems.

Memory patcher disabling minimap preview generation:
http://blog.hispasec.com/lab/files/SC\_Patch.c
http://blog.hispasec.com/lab/files/SC\_Patch.exe (compiled binary)
== Vendor status and solution ==
The vendor has been informed but has not yet released a proper patch
(a fix for this issue was not included in the 1.15.1 patch).
The sollution is to becareful when joining games on unknown maps.
See SC\_Patch.c and SC\_Patch.exe (links in the Details section) for a
memory patcher that disables minimap preview generation in the running
StarCraft application.
