# DenyHosts: Denial of service — GLSA **200710-14**

DenyHosts does not correctly parse log entries, potentially causing a
remote Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/denyhosts** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.6-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.6-r1** |

### Background

DenyHosts is designed to monitor SSH servers for repeated failed login
attempts.

### Description

Daniel B. Cid discovered that DenyHosts used an incomplete regular
expression to parse failed login attempts, a different issue than GLSA
200701-01.

### Impact

A remote unauthenticated attacker can add arbitrary hosts into the
blacklist, including the "all" keyword, by submitting specially crafted
version identification strings to the SSH server banner. An attacker
may use this to prevent legitimate users from accessing a host
remotely.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All DenyHosts users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/denyhosts-2.6-r1"
```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=244943#c0)  Jonathan Underwood    2007-06-19 23:42:56 UTC  ``` Description of problem: See this:  <http://www.ossec.net/en/attacking-loganalysis.html#denyhosts>  which details a DOS vulnerability in the current version of Denyhosts (2.6).  In particular this part details the problem and the fix:  " FAILED_ENTRY_REGEX5 = re.compile(r"""User (?P.*) .*from (?P.*) not allowed because none of user's groups are listed in AllowGroups""")  It is basically looking for "User from .." anywhere in the log, not checking if it is in the middle of the "bad protocol version" log. How do we fix that? Just make the regex more robust (an "$" at the end would solve it)!  You may think it is not a big deal but what if instead of one IP address I pass all? -- all on hosts.deny means block every IP. Would it block the whole internet out of the box? Yes, it would! "   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=244943#c1)  Jonathan Underwood    2007-06-19 23:48:27 UTC  ```  A perhaps clearer description of the fix:  We spoke with DenyHosts author, Phil Schwartz, but no official patch is available yet. However, by changing the FAILED_ENTRY_REGEX5 (at regex.py) to the following, fixes the problem:  FAILED_ENTRY_REGEX5 = re.compile(r"""User (?P.*) .*from (?P.*) not allowed because none of user's groups are listed in AllowGroups$""")    ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=244943#c2)  Jonathan Underwood    2007-06-19 23:53:35 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 157433](attachment.cgi?id=157433&action=diff "Fix DOS vulnerability in REGEX5") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=157433&action=edit "Fix DOS vulnerability in REGEX5") Fix DOS vulnerability in REGEX5  Trivial patch - thought it might save you a few mins :)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=244943#c3)  Jason Tibbitts    2007-06-19 23:54:59 UTC  ``` Actually I've already applied a fix and a build is in progress.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=244943#c4)  Jonathan Underwood    2007-06-19 23:57:22 UTC  ``` Oh, ok, sorry for the noise.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=244943#c5)  Jason Tibbitts    2007-06-20 00:04:28 UTC  ``` Builds:  <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=9311> (f8) <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=9312> (f7)  I will push the f7 package to updates-testing as soon as it's finished.  Testing would be appreciated.  I'll push it to release tomorrow if there are no issues.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=244943#c6)  Jonathan Underwood    2007-06-20 00:12:25 UTC  ``` OK, I just pulled the F7 build from Koji and installed it.

From my perspective this is an upstream issue.

Now I'm not sure what best shall we do, stabilize or mask. Taking short look at forums I'd say that users use it and it's better to keep. But personally I do not use this tool so I'd like somebody else to take this decision.  ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-24 16:22:31 UTC  ``` I think we should mask this one. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-24 18:08:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=181213#c7)) > I think we should mask this one.  Why? Masking doesn't make anything easier for us than stabling this.  It should be the maintainer's decision to Last-Rite and not that of Security once a security issue is fixed. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-24 18:18:36 UTC  ``` @rbu It was just my personal opinion.  Arches please test and mark stable. Target keywords are:  denyhosts-2.6-r1.ebuild:KEYWORDS="alpha amd64 hppa ~ppc sparc x86" ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Christian Faulhammer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-24 18:25:49 UTC  ``` x86 stable ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Jeroen Roovers (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-25 00:26:06 UTC  ``` Stable for HPPA. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Raúl Porcel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-25 14:28:27 UTC  ``` alpha/sparc stable ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Philippe Chaintreuil    2007-09-26 17:11:31 UTC  ``` By the way, I just wanted to throw in my two cents as a user of this package.  I find it a helpful and useful program, and would be very sad if it was removed from the tree.  It is a little sad that UPSTREAM seems to be losing interest in this program.  He's getting slower and slower about fixing/improving things.  But I'd rather have this program than not have it.  Additionally I appreciate the maintainers of this ebuild for keeping it patched & working when it matters -- especially when UPSTREAM is slow/appears dead.   > local users can still attack it with logger.  I trust my local users -- that's why they have accounts.  I don't trust people trying to break into my machine from the internet -- that's why I use this program.  <rant> I know, I know.... layers of security ... an onion....  But that's hog-wash if I don't have a defense from random people running scripts against my box from all over the world at all hours of the day.  At least if a local user starts doing something strange, I know where they live and can go smack them upside the head.  Plane tickets to China are too expensive. </rant> ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-29 00:59:20 UTC  ``` This is CVE-2007-4323. ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Steve Dibb (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-29 02:19:03 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-29 09:00:19 UTC  ``` B3 -> [glsa?]  Please vote. ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-02 21:21:21 UTC  ``` it can block SSH connections from everywhere.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
