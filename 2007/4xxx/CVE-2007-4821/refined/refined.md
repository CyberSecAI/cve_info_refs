- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `HttpDownloadFileToTempDir` method of the EDraw Office Viewer Component ActiveX control.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `HttpDownloadFileToTempDir` method does not properly validate the length of the input buffer, leading to a buffer overflow when a large string is passed to it. Specifically, the vulnerable component is identified as officeviewer.ocx v. 5.2.218.1

- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, and potentially allow an attacker to overwrite the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) chain and gain control of the execution flow, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's system. The provided proof of concept demonstrates the ability to crash the application by overflowing the buffer with a large string of "A" characters.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a malicious website containing the vulnerable ActiveX control. An attacker can craft a webpage that leverages the ActiveX control and calls the vulnerable `HttpDownloadFileToTempDir` method with a buffer of excessive length.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host or inject a malicious webpage containing the ActiveX exploit. The victim needs to use a vulnerable version of the EDraw Office Viewer Component and visit the malicious page in Internet Explorer or any software that uses the vulnerable ocx control. The proof of concept was tested on Windows XP Professional SP2 with Internet Explorer 7. The ActiveX is marked as Safe for Script, Init, and implements IObjectSafety, IDisp Safe and IPStorage Safe, making it easier to exploit.
