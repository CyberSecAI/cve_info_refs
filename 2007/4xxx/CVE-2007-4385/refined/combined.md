Bypassing servlet input validation filters (OWASP Stinger + Struts example)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~
0. ORIGINAL ADVISORY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
http://o0o.nu/~meder/o0o\_bypassing\_servlet\_input\_validation\_filters.txt
I. BACKGROUND
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NOTE: This advisory will use OWASP's Stinger and Struts framework to
illustrate the concept, however this technique should be applicable to
other input validation servlet filters that do not handle multipart
requests properly and frameworks that automatically parse multipart
requests.
Java Servlets provide a filter component which can dynamically intercept
requests and responses to transform information contained in the
requests or responses[1]. Servlet filters are often recommended as an
effective way to perform input validation in Java web applications due
to the centralized nature and little modifications required to the
application's code.
Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has developed Stinger,
which aims to provide a centralized input validation component which can
be easily applied to existing or developmental applications[4].
There is a vulnerability in servlet filters, such as the Stinger filter,
which under certain conditions will allow attacker to bypass input
validation routines of the filter thus supplying unvalidated input to
the application, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities, such as XSS or
SQL injection.
II. DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OWASP Stinger is built with the assumption that content of requests passing
through it are always form-urlencoded. This assumption is harmless in a
simple J2EE web application setup as both Stinger and application will
use the same methods to access HTTP parameters (i.e. Request.getParameter()
or Request.getParameterNames()[3]). However, in an application that uses
frameworks that abstract HTTP protocol and provide automatic request
handling/parsing, this assumption can result in the ability to bypass
Stinger filtering while still delivering inputs to the target application.
The following Stinger code snippet illustrates the problem (Stinger.java):
private int checkMalformedParameters(...) {
...
e = request.getParameterNames();
while(e.hasMoreElements()) {
...
}
...
}
If HTTP request content was form-urlencoded then request.getParameterNames()
will return Enumeration of all HTTP parameters names. However, if the request
is multipart encoded, Enumeration that is returned will be empty and
e.hasMoreElements() will return false, which in turn will result in
Stinger not performing any input validation on the multipart encoded HTTP
requests. It should be noted that standard servlet API doesn't provide a
convenient way of handling multipart requests.
If the target application is a plain vanilla servlet application,
multipart encoded HTTP parameters will not be returned by the
Request.getParameter() call and thus input will not be honored by the
target application. However, frameworks like Struts abstract HTTP
details from the application and perform automatic parsing of HTTP
requests, including multipart encoded requests. The framework will then
pass the input parameters supplied in a multipart request to the
application, which will be unaware whether parameters came in through a
multipart request or a regular form-urlencoded request. And as Stinger
did not perform any validation on the multipart request, unescaped and
unvalidated data will be supplied to the application, which in turn may
result in a security vulnerability such as XSS or SQL injection being
exploited.
III. Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Following WebScarab beanshell script can be used test existing servlet
filter implementations:
http://o0o.nu/~meder/toolz/Multipartify.txt
IV. RECOMMENDATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Servlet filters should handle multipart requests and perform input
validation on the multipart encoded content.
Additionally, following the multi-layered security approach,
applications should not rely on the filter to provide input validation
and be the only line of defense. Most of the frameworks today provide
a way to perform input validation within the application [5,6].
Also, if multipart requests are not required by the application (e.g.
no file uploads are performed) automatic handling of multipart requests
should be disabled in the framework and servlet filter could be
configured to drop multipart requests.
V. VENDOR STATUS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OWASP Stinger 2.5 contains a quick fix to drop non-urlencoded requests.
VI. DISCLOSURE TIMELINE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
18/07/2007 - Vulnerability details sent to the maintainer
23/07/2007 - Vulnerability details resent
26/07/2007 - Initial vendor response (delay due to spam filters)
05/08/2007 - Quick-fix implemented dropping multipart requests in
Stinger 2.5

Williams for helping to get in contact with maintainer. Eric Sheridan

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
