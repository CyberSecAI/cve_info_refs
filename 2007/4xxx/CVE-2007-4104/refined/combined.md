How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Plugin WP-FeedStats in neuer Version

##### Die Zeiten ändern sich.

Dieser Beitrag scheint älter als 17 Jahre zu sein – eine lange Zeit im Internet. Der Inhalt ist vielleicht veraltet.

Das Plugin [WP-FeedStats](https://bueltge.de/wp-feedstats-de-plugin/171/) hatte wohl eine Sicherheitslücke, die ich allerdings nicht nachvollziehen kann. Auf meinen Testservern kann ich keine Scripte injizieren. Ich habe nun alle Ausgaben des Plugins mit der Funktion *htmlspecialchars* versehen, so dass es theoretisch nicht mehr möglich ist, Zeichen für Code zu übergeben.

Ich habe mehrere Tests gefahren – ohne Erfolg. Vielleicht ist ein Leser unter euch, der sich wesentlich besser mit dem injizieren von Webseiten auskennt. Schön wäre es, wenn sich einige Tester finden und mir mal eine Information zukommen lassen. Ebenso habe ich Blogsecurity eine Version zukommen lassen, bisher leider unbeantwortet – aber ich denke, David wird sich nochmal zu einem Test hinreisen lassen.

Für die Nicht-XSS-Leser, die aber auch mal testen wollen, folgende Möglichkeit:

Die URL zum Feed aufrufen und auf den folgenden Syntax erweitern, zum Beispiel wie der folgende Syntax. Ist das Blog unsicher, so wird ein Popup erzeugt.

```
http://deinblog/_wp1/?feed=rss2&<script>alert(1)</script>
```

**Update**

Nun habe ich doch noch einen Fehler im Plugin gefunden - bitte die aktuelle [Version 2.4](https://bueltge.de/wp-feedstats-de-plugin/171/) aufspielen. Ich hoffe, dass nun Schluss mit den möglichen Lücken ist.

**Update 2**

David von [Blogsecurity](http://blogsecurity.net/news/news-130707/) hat sich nun die neue Version nochmal vorgenommen und kann keinerlei Sicherheitslücke finden, er ist mit dem Resultat sehr zu frieden und nutzt das Plugin wieder.

   Seit dem Update sieht mein Eintrag im Tellerand so aus:

   > Gesamt: 581 (Letzten 20 Tage)

   > Maximum: 60 (attribute\_escape()

   > Durchschnitt: 29

   Kann es sein, dass sich da irgendwo ein Fehler eingeschlichen hat?

    Was mich immernoch stört ist, wenn man das Plugin in ein Unterverzeichnis z.B. /feedstats wegen besserer Übersichtlichkeit legt, stimmen sämliche Pfadangaben nicht mehr. Ich muss die erst jedes Mal in der wp-feedstats.php anpassen. Liegt das an mir bzw. meinen Server oder ist das ein allgemeines Problem?

## WordPress Tipps & Tricks, Entwicklung

All mein Wissen und Können, ob als WordPress Experte bezeichnet oder nicht, steht Ihnen damit zur Verfügung. WordPress ist seit Jahren ein Begleiter von mir und spielt eine umfassende Rolle beim Entwickeln von Erweiterungen, Designs und Gesamtlösungen. Viele Inhalte und Nachweise meines Wissens bekommen Sie frei auf dieser Website, alternativ für einen recht geringen Preis in Buchform oder das Basiswissen in einem Video-Training. Entscheiden Sie, mit welchem Dienst Sie Ihre Zeit verbringen möchten oder ob Sie meine Erfahrung und Wissen persönlich nutzen wollen. WordPress ist meine Spezialität im Rahmen der Webentwicklung – Plugins, Dropins und Themes stammen aus meiner Feder. Sprechen Sie mich an, wenn Sie Hilfe brauchen, eine Lösung suchen oder eine Änderung an bestehenden Erweiterungen brauchen.
