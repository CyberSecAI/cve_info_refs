Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2007-4104:

**Summary:**

The provided content details a security vulnerability found in the WordPress plugin WP-FeedStats.  The vulnerability is an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) issue that could be exploited by injecting malicious code through the plugin's feed output. The author of the plugin addressed the issue by using `htmlspecialchars` on the plugin outputs, and later found another bug which was fixed in version 2.4.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The initial vulnerability was due to the plugin not properly sanitizing user-controlled data before displaying it in the RSS feed, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.
*   The second bug was related to an unescaped single quote in an attribute.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability was XSS, where an attacker could inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of a user's browser when they view the feed.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute malicious JavaScript code in the browsers of users visiting the blog's feed. This could potentially be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker could inject the malicious script by appending a `<script>` tag to the feed URL, as shown in the example `http://deinblog/_wp1/?feed=rss2&<script>alert(1)</script>`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload and get a user to access it, typically by having a user view the crafted feed URL through a link.
