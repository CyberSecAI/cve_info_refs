| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=336101#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2007-10-17 13:12:16 UTC  ``` The ricci daemon will accept a maximum of 10 active connections. If the connection limit is reached, new connections will be dropped. ricci only updates its connection count (after freeing all stale connections) when poll(2) returns 0. If an attacker fills the connection queue, and either keeps sending data or keeps connecting (or does anything else that'd cause poll() to return non-zero), ricci will be unable to accept new connections.  This was found during a code audit chasing down a memory leak bug..  initial triage, assigning CVE name and metadata CVSS medium 4.7 (AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=336101#c2)  Mark J. Cox    2007-10-31 12:29:46 UTC  ``` removing embargo   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=336101#c3)  Red Hat Product Security    2008-01-11 17:21:31 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in:  Red Hat Cluster Suite:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0983.html>  Red Hat Enterprise Linux:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0640.html>   ``` |  |

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0640)

## Topic

Updated conga packages that correct a security flaw and provide bug fixes
and add enhancements are now available.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Conga package is a web-based administration tool for remote cluster and
storage management.

A flaw was found in ricci during a code audit. A remote attacker who is
able to connect to ricci could cause ricci to temporarily refuse additional
connections, a denial of service (CVE-2007-4136).

Fixes in this updated package include:

* The nodename is now set for manual fencing.
* The node log no longer displays in random order.
* A bug that prevented a node from responding when a cluster was deleted is

now fixed.

* A PAM configuration that incorrectly called the deprecated module

pam\_stack was removed.

* A bug that prevented some quorum disk configurations from being accepted

is now fixed.

* Setting multicast addresses now works properly.
* rpm -V on luci no longer fails.
* The user interface rendering time for storage interface is now faster.
* An error message that incorrectly appeared when rebooting nodes during

cluster creation was removed.

* Cluster snaps configuration (an unsupported feature) has been removed

altogether to prevent user confusion.

* A user permission bug resulting from a luci code error is now fixed.
* luci and ricci init script return codes are now LSB-compliant.
* VG creation on cluster nodes now defaults to "clustered".
* An SELinux AVC bug that prevented users from setting up shared storage on

nodes is now fixed.

* An access error that occurred when attempting to access a cluster node

after its cluster was deleted is now fixed.

* IP addresses can now be used to create clusters.
* Attempting to configure a fence device no longer results in an

AttributeError.

* Attempting to create a new fence device to a valid cluster no longer

results in a KeyError.

* Several minor user interface validation errors have been fixed, such as

enforcing cluster name length and fence port, etc.

* A browser lock-up that could occur during storage configuration has been

fixed.

* Virtual service creation now works without error.
* The fence\_xvm tag is no longer misspelled in the cluster.conf file.
* Luci failover forms are complete and working.
* Rebooting a fresh cluster install no longer generates an error message.
* A bug that prevented failed cluster services from being started is now

fixed.

* A bug that caused some cluster operations (e.g., node delete) to fail on

clusters with mixed-cased cluster names is now fixed.

* Global cluster resources can be reused when constructing cluster

services.

Enhancements in this updated package include:

* Users can now access Conga through Internet Explorer 6.
* Dead nodes can now be evicted from a cluster.
* Shared storage on new clusters is now enabled by default.
* The fence user-interface flow is now simpler.
* A port number is now shown in ricci error messages.
* The kmod-gfs-xen kernel module is now installed when creating a cluster.
* Cluster creation status is now shown visually.
* User names are now sorted for display.
* The fence\_xvmd tag can now be added from the dom0 cluster nodes.
* The ampersand character (&) can now be used in fence names.
* All packaged files are now installed with proper owners and permissions.
* New cluster node members are now properly initialized.
* Storage operations can now be completed even if an LVM snapshot is present.
* Users are now informed via dialog when nodes are rebooted as part of a

cluster operation.

* Failover domains are now properly listed for virtual services and

traditional clustered services.

* Luci can now create and distribute keys for fence\_xvmd.

All Conga users are advised to upgrade to this update, which applies these
fixes and enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=336101#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2007-10-17 13:12:16 UTC  ``` The ricci daemon will accept a maximum of 10 active connections. If the connection limit is reached, new connections will be dropped. ricci only updates its connection count (after freeing all stale connections) when poll(2) returns 0. If an attacker fills the connection queue, and either keeps sending data or keeps connecting (or does anything else that'd cause poll() to return non-zero), ricci will be unable to accept new connections.  This was found during a code audit chasing down a memory leak bug..  initial triage, assigning CVE name and metadata CVSS medium 4.7 (AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=336101#c2)  Mark J. Cox    2007-10-31 12:29:46 UTC  ``` removing embargo   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=336101#c3)  Red Hat Product Security    2008-01-11 17:21:31 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in:  Red Hat Cluster Suite:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0983.html>  Red Hat Enterprise Linux:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0640.html>   ``` |  |
