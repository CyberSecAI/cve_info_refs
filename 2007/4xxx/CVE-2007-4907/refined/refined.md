Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the way X-Cart handles the `xcart_dir` parameter in several PHP files. It allows for the inclusion of a remote file by manipulating this parameter.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include remote files, which could be arbitrary, by exploiting the lack of proper validation of the `xcart_dir` parameter.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code on the server. This may lead to complete compromise of the web server and the data stored on the server, as well as the ability to further attack internal networks through the compromised system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests, manipulating the `xcart_dir` parameter in several vulnerable PHP files. The listed vulnerable files are: `config.php`, `prepare.php`, `smarty.php`, `customer/product.php`, `provider/auth.php` and `admin/auth.php`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable X-Cart installation and must have a server under their control where they can host the malicious files which are to be included remotely.
