```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the 'cat' parameter in the `directory.php` file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers can bypass authentication, extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords for both administrators and regular users.
- Attack vectors: By manipulating the 'cat' parameter in the `directory.php` URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
