Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `$query` variable in `search.php` is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query, allowing for SQL injection.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `query` parameter in `search.php` is vulnerable.

*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches (e.g., obtaining usernames and passwords), data manipulation, or denial of service. In this specific example, the exploit demonstrates retrieving usernames and passwords.

*   **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector is through the `search.php` page using an HTTP POST request. The attacker injects SQL code within the `query` parameter.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable `search.php` page with a manipulated `query` parameter. No special privileges are needed.

The provided exploit shows how to use `UNION SELECT` to retrieve usernames and passwords. The exploit is straightforward, needing only to inject the following SQL injection payload within the search field:
`')/**/union/**/select/**/0,0,0,username,0,0,0,0,0,password,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0/**/from/**/getmyown_user/*`
