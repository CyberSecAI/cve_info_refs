Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4777:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The provided content indicates that there are multiple security vulnerabilities present in Joomla 1.5 RC1, including a SQL injection vulnerability, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, and full path disclosure vulnerabilities. Specifically, the full path disclosure vulnerabilities are caused by direct access to ".../tmpl/...php" files, which expose the full installation path. However, the specific details of CVE-2007-4777 aren't available within the provided content, except that it is one of multiple vulnerabilities identified in the report.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** Direct access to certain php files reveals the server's full installation path.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain knowledge of the full server path, which can be useful in further attacks, such as directory traversal.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Direct Access:** Attackers can directly access vulnerable PHP files, particularly those located within the `/tmpl/` directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote Access:** Attackers need to be able to send requests to the vulnerable web server and directly access the vulnerable files.

**Additional Information:**

*   The content mentions that there is an SQL injection and an XSS vulnerability within Joomla 1.5 RC 1, but these are explicitly associated with CVE-2007-4780 and CVE-2007-4779, respectively.
*   The advisory states that Joomla has released a new version (Joomla 1.5 RC 2), which presumably addresses these issues.
*   The specific details and exploit of the identified SQL injection vulnerability are not published in this advisory, as it was sent to the Joomla developers.
