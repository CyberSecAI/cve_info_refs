```
  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `download.php` script of Chupix CMS 0.2.3, where user-supplied input from the `repertoire` and `fichier` GET parameters is directly concatenated into a file path without sufficient sanitization.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Path traversal vulnerability in `download.php` which allows attackers to access arbitrary files on the server.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can disclose sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to further compromise of the system.",
    "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `repertoire` and `fichier` parameters in the URL with path traversal sequences such as `../`, an attacker can force the script to read any file accessible by the web server user.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web server and manipulate URL parameters."
