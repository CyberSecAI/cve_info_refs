| Description | The IAX2 channel driver in Asterisk is vulnerable to a |
| | Denial of Service attack when configured to allow |
| | unauthenticated calls. An attacker can send a flood of |
| | NEW packets for valid extensions to the server to |
| | initiate calls as the unauthenticated user. This will |
| | cause resources on the Asterisk system to get allocated |
| | that will never go away. Furthermore, the IAX2 channel |
| | driver will be stuck trying to reschedule |
| | retransmissions for each of these fake calls forever. |
| | This can very quickly bring down a system and the only |
| | way to recover is to restart Asterisk. |
| | |
| | Detailed Explanation: |
| | |
| | Within the last few months, we made some changes to |
| | chan\_iax2 to combat the abuse of this module for traffic |
| | amplification attacks. Unfortunately, this has caused an |
| | unintended side effect. |
| | |
| | The summary of the change to combat traffic |
| | amplification is this. Once you start the PBX on the |
| | Asterisk channel, it will begin receiving frames to be |
| | sent back out to the network. We delayed this from |
| | happening until a 3-way handshake has occurred to help |
| | ensure that we are talking to the IP address the |
| | messages appear to be coming from. |
| | |
| | When chan\_iax2 accepts an unauthenticated call, it |
| | immediately creates the ast\_channel for the call. |
| | However, since the 3-way handshake has not been |
| | completed, the PBX is not started on this channel. |
| | |
| | Later, when the maximum number of retries have been |
| | exceeded on responses to this NEW, the code tries to |
| | hang up the call. Now, it has 2 ways to do this, |
| | depending on if there is an ast\_channel related to this |
| | IAX2 session or not. If there is no channel, then it can |
| | just destroy the iax2 private structure and move on. If |
| | there is a channel, it queues a HANGUP frame, and |
| | expects that to make the ast\_channel get torn down, |
| | which would then cause the pvt struct to get destroyed |
| | afterwords. |
| | |
| | However, since there was no PBX started on this channel, |
| | there is nothing servicing the channel to receive the |
| | HANGUP frame. Therefore, the call never gets destroyed. |
| | To make things worse, there is some code continuously |
| | rescheduling PINGs and LAGRQs to be sent for the active |
| | IAX2 call, which will always fail. |
| | |
| | In summary, sending a bunch of NEW frames to request |
| | unauthenticated calls can make a server unusable within |
| | a matter of seconds. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-+
| Resolution | The default configuration that is distributed with |
| | Asterisk includes a guest account that allows |
| | unauthenticated calls. If this account and any other |
| | account without a password is disabled for IAX2, then the |
| | system is not vulnerable to this problem. |
| | |
| | For systems that continue to allow unauthenticated IAX2 |
| | calls, they must be updated to one of the versions listed |
| | as including the fix below. |

These releases contain fixes for four critical security vulnerabilities.  One of these vulnerabilities is a remotely exploitable stack buffer overflow, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine.

# Asterisk: Multiple vulnerabilities â GLSA **200802-11**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Asterisk.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/asterisk** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.21.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **1.2.17-r1**>= **1.2.21.1-r1** |

### Background

Asterisk is an open source telephony engine and tool kit.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Asterisk:

* Russel Bryant reported a stack buffer overflow in the IAX2 channel
  driver (chan\_iax2) when bridging calls between chan\_iax2 and any
  channel driver that uses RTP for media (CVE-2007-3762).
* Chris
  Clark and Zane Lackey (iSEC Partners) reported a NULL pointer
  dereference in the IAX2 channel driver (chan\_iax2)
  (CVE-2007-3763).
* Will Drewry (Google Security) reported a
  vulnerability in the Skinny channel driver (chan\_skinny), resulting in
  an overly large memcpy (CVE-2007-3764).
* Will Drewry (Google
  Security) reported a vulnerability in the IAX2 channel driver
  (chan\_iax2), that does not correctly handle unauthenticated
  transactions using a 3-way handshake (CVE-2007-4103).

### Impact

By sending a long voice or video RTP frame, a remote attacker could
possibly execute arbitrary code on the target machine. Sending
specially crafted LAGRQ or LAGRP frames containing information elements
of IAX frames, or a certain data length value in a crafted packet, or
performing a flood of calls not completing a 3-way handshake, could
result in a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Asterisk users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/asterisk-1.2.17-r1"
```
