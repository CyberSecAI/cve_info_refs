```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to the use of an unsanitized variable ($format_menue) in an include statement within the 'admin/inc/change_action.php' file.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server on the vulnerable server. This can lead to complete compromise of the affected system.
  - Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious URL with a modified 'format_menue' parameter, the attacker can point the vulnerable server to a remote file containing malicious code.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP request to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication is necessary for this exploit.
