## Details

It was discovered that arbitrary Java methods were not filtered out when

opening databases in OpenOffice.org. If a user were tricked into running

a specially crafted query, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary

Java with user privileges. ([CVE-2007-4575](/security/CVE-2007-4575))

Multiple memory overflow flaws were discovered in OpenOffice.org's

handling of Quattro Pro, EMF, and OLE files. If a user were tricked

into opening a specially crafted document, a remote attacker might be

able to execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2007-5745](/security/CVE-2007-5745),

[CVE-2007-5746](/security/CVE-2007-5746), [CVE-2007-5747](/security/CVE-2007-5747), [CVE-2008-0320](/security/CVE-2008-0320))

Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!

## Available documentation

To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the [Documentation topic](#Documentation_topics) links provided below.

Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a *Handbook:* or *Project:* prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective *Discussion* pages.

Find something to add or edit? The [*Getting started*](#Getting_started) section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.

Most importantly, the **Gentoo Handbook** is among the best documents found on the wiki:

 [Gentoo Handbook (Official installation documentation)](/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page "Handbook:Main Page")

 **Important**
Due to usability issues the [visual editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVisualEditor "wikipedia:Wikipedia:VisualEditor") has been temporarily disabled. See [bug #910279](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910279) for more details.
#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# OpenOffice.org: User-assisted arbitrary code execution — GLSA **200712-25**

An unspecified vulnerability has been reported in OpenOffice.org, possibly
allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-office/openoffice** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.3.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.3.1** |

| Package | **app-office/openoffice-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.3.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.3.1** |

| Package | **dev-db/hsqldb** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.8.0.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.8.0.9** |

### Background

OpenOffice.org is an open source office productivity suite, including
word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, drawing, data charting,
formula editing, and file conversion facilities.

### Description

The HSQLDB engine, as used in Openoffice.org, does not properly enforce
restrictions to SQL statements.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
document, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary Java
code with the privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenOffice.org users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-2.3.1"
```

All OpenOffice.org binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-2.3.1"
```

All HSQLDB users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/hsqldb-1.8.0.9"
```

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

PowerPC CPUs can operate in two modes: *big-endian* and *little-endian*.

* The **ppc** and **ppc64** stages are *big-endian* stages and can be used with *any PowerPC* CPU, including some old Apple™ hardware.
* The **ppc64le** stages are *little-endian* stages and are created for running on *POWER8 and newer* CPUs.
* The **power9le** stages are *little-endian* stages optimized exclusively for *POWER9* CPUs.

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
OpenOffice\_org was updated to add restrictions to SQL statements of
Java-based databases to avoid the execution of native Java code by
creating procedures. (CVE-2007-4575)
OpenOffice\_org packages for SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 and
openSUSE 10.3 were released last Thursday, packages for SUSE Linux
10.0, 10.1 and openSUSE 10.2 were released just today due to some
build issues.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of OpenOffice after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-09 20:46:45 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #200771](show_bug.cgi?id=200771 "RESOLVED FIXED - app-office/openoffice(-bin) < 2.3.1 HSQLDB database Java code execution (CVE-2007-4575)") +++  Thomas Biege:   A security vulnerability in HSQLDB, the default database engine shipped   with OpenOffice.org, may allow a remote unprivileged user who provides a   StarOffice database document that is opened by a local user to execute   arbitrary Java code on the system with the privileges of the user   running OpenOffice.org.  This probably also affects our independent ebuild, too. See [bug 111960](show_bug.cgi?id=111960 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - version bump: dev-db/hsqldb 1.8.0.7") and java overlay for new ebuilds. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Vlastimil Babka (Caster) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-19 21:59:56 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 111960](show_bug.cgi?id=111960 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - version bump: dev-db/hsqldb 1.8.0.7") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Vlastimil Babka (Caster) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-19 22:01:56 UTC  ``` Arches, please stabilize the just added dev-db/hsqldb-1.8.0.9 ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Markus Meier   gentoo-dev  2007-12-20 13:53:15 UTC  ``` x86 stable ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-20 15:25:06 UTC  ``` Enhancing prioriy, this one should be stabled ASAP so that we can send the OpenOffice draft. Thanks. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Tobias Scherbaum (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-21 12:51:56 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Peter Weller (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-26 08:36:41 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Tom Gall (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-30 18:00:10 UTC  ``` stable on ppc64 ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-30 18:31:27 UTC  ``` GLSA 200712-25, thanks everyone. ``` |  |

\*\* This privacy policy is currently being adopted and may not yet be fully implemented at all websites \*\*

This Privacy Policy clarifies the nature, scope and purpose of the processing of personal data
(hereinafter referred to as âDataâ) within our online offering and the related websites, features
and content, as well as external online presence, e.g. our social media profiles on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and similar sites
(collectively referred to as âonline presenceâ).
With regard to the terminology we use, e.g. âProcessingâ or âResponsibleâ,
we refer to the definitions in Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## 1. Name and contact details of the controller and the company data protection officer

This privacy policy applies to data processing by:

Responsible:

The Apache Software Foundation

V. P. Data Privacy

1000 N West Street, Suite 1200

Wilmington, DE 19801

U.S.A.

E-Mail: vp-privacy@apache.org

## 2. Collection and storage of personal data and the nature and purpose of their use

### a) When visiting the website

#### Log files

When you visit our websites ([full list of domains](/policies/asf-domains.html)) or one of our subdomains,
the browser on your device automatically sends information to the server of our website.
This information is temporarily stored in a log file.
The following information is being collected without your intervention and stored until automated deletion:

* The IP address of the requesting computer
* The date and time of access
* The name and URL of the retrieved file
* The website from which access is made (referrer URL)
* Geo information of the location from which access is made
* The browser used and, if applicable, the operating system of your computer and the name of your access provider

The data mentioned are processed by us for the following purposes:

* Ensuring connectivity of our website
* Ensuring a use of our website, of which we think is comfortable for you
* Evaluation of system security and stability
* Other administrative purposes

The retention time for this data is 90 days.

The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f GDPR.
Our legitimate interest follows from the data collection purposes listed above.
In no case do we use the collected data for the purpose of drawing conclusions about you.
In addition, we use cookies and analysis services when you visit our website.
Further details can be found under no. 4 and 5 of this privacy policy.

#### Matomo

In addition to log files, some of our websites use Matomo to understand what parts of the
website are important to our users, what features are most frequently accessed,
where users get lost in the documentation, etc.
This data allows us to better understand how users use the system, the website,
and the docs and where to focus improvements next.

The collected information consists of the following:

* The IP address from which you access the website
* The type of browser and operating system you use to access our site
* The date and time you access our site
* The pages you visit
* If you click on any of the file download links on our website
* The addresses of pages from where you followed a link to our site
* The addresses of pages you go to from our site
* The search terms you use on the website

This information is gathered and stored using the open source software Matomo. We donât
use any cookies to collect this information. An IP address is anonymized by removing
the last two octets from the IP address. That means that if your IP is 192.168.100.50,
we store it as 192.168.0.0.

Matomo is self-hosted on a virtual machine provided by the Apache Software Foundation.
It can only be accessed by members of the Apache Privacy committee. The data can be
viewed by anyone by visiting https://analytics.apache.org/.

Matomo respects any Do Not Track setting in your browser. You can also opt-out
from all Matomo tracking below.

### b) When registering for our newsletter and mailing lists

If, pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, you have expressly consented,
we use your e-mail address to periodically send you our newsletter.
For the receipt of the newsletter the indication of an e-mail address is sufficient.

We inform our visitors at regular intervals through newsletters about news and offers from The Apache Software Foundation.

The newsletter of our Foundation can only be received if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers for the newsletter.
For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by an affected person before the first time of sending the newsletter, using the double-opt-in procedure.
This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address is the person who authorized the receipt of the newsletter.

When you subscribe to the newsletter, we store the date and time of registration and the email address.
The collection of this data is necessary for us to understand the (possible) misuse of an affected personâs e-mail address at a later date and therefore serves as legal safeguards for the controller.

The personal data collected in the context of registering for the newsletter is used exclusively to send our newsletter.

Subscribers may also be notified by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or registration, as might be the case in the event of changes to the newsletter/mailing list or technical changes.

There will be no transfer to third parties of the personal data collected as part of the newsletter service.

Subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the person concerned at any time.
Consent to the storage of personal data that the person has given us for the newsletter dispatch can be revoked at any time.
For the purpose of revoking the consent, instructions are given by the end of each newsletter email.

### c) When registering for our mailing lists

If, pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, you have expressly consented, we use your e-mail address to send you messages arriving at our mailing lists.
For the receipt of the mailing list message the indication of an e-mail address is sufficient.

Visitors may communicate with us through our mailing lists.

The mailing list messages of our organisation can only be received if (1) the person concerned has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers for the mailing list.
For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by an affected person for the first time using the double-opt-in procedure.
This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address authorized the receipt of the mailing list messages.

When you subscribe to a mailing list, we store the date and time of registration and the email address.
The collection of this data is necessary for us to understand the (possible) misuse of an affected personâs e-mail address at a later date and therefore serves as legal safeguards for the controller.
When a mailing list is archived, the log file will be deleted.

The personal data collected in the context of registering for a mailing list will be used exclusively to send messages arriving at that mailing list.

Subscribers may also be notified by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the mailing list service or registration, as might be the case in the event of changes to the mailing list or other technical changes.

We will not actively transfer to third parties any personal data as part of the mailing list service.
However, almost all of our mailing lists are of a public nature.

This means, your name and email may be exposed to the public.
Also, all information you send to a mailing list will be exposed to the public.
Third parties may collect this information and process it separately.
The sender of messages is responsible if they expose their personal data to the public.

All content sent to mailing lists is archived indefinitely.
By using our mailing list service, you agree that any content is archived in that way.

Subscription to our mailing lists may be terminated by the person concerned at any time.
The consent to the storage of personal data that a person has given us for the mailing list dispatch can be revoked at any time.
For the purpose of revoking the consent, instructions are given by the end of every email.

## 3. Disclosure of data

Transfer of your personal data to third parties for purposes other than those listed below does not take place.
We only share your personal information with third parties if:

* You, in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a GDPR, have given express consent to this.
* Disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR is required to assert, exercise or defend legal claims and there is no reason to assume that you have a predominantly legitimate interest in not disclosing your data.
* Disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR is a legal obligation.
* As permitted by law and according to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR, disclosure is required for the settlement of contractual relationships with you.

## 4. External service providers

The Apache Software Foundation uses the following external service providers who help to optimize its services.
Insofar as these service providers process data on behalf of The Apache Software Foundation, agreements have been concluded with them which set the European data protection standards as binding and, in particular, prohibit the use of the data for other purposes.
If we commission third parties to process data on the basis of a so-called âcontract processing contractâ, this is done on the basis of Art. 28 GDPR.

## 5. Social Media Plug-ins

We rely on our website on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR social plug-ins from the social networks Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to make our company better known.
The underlying commercial purpose is to be regarded as a legitimate interest within the meaning of the GDPR.
Responsibility for operation compliant with data protection is to be guaranteed by the respective providers.
The integration of these plug-ins by us is done by means of the so-called two-click method to protect visitors to our website in the best possible way.

### a) YouTube

On our website we have integrated components from YouTube.
YouTube is an internet video portal that allows video publishers to freely watch video clips provided by other users for free viewing, rating and commenting.
YouTube allows the publication of all types of videos, so that both complete film and television broadcasts, music videos, trailers and user-made videos uploaded via the YouTube internet portal are available.

YouTubeâs operating company is YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.
YouTube, LLC is a subsidiary of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.

Each visit to one of the pages of this site operated by the controller and incorporating a YouTube component (YouTube video) will automatically cause the Internet browser on the subjectâs information technology system to download an illustration of the corresponding YouTube component from YouTube.
More information about YouTube can be found at https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/en/.
As part of this technical process, YouTube and Google are aware of the specific location of our site visited by the person concerned.
If the person visiting our site is logged in to YouTube at the same time, YouTube calls a sub-page containing a YouTube video for the person visiting our site.
This information is collected by YouTube and Google and associated with the individual YouTube account.

YouTube and Google will always receive information through the YouTube component that a person has visited our website if the person is logged into YouTube at the time of access to our website; this happens regardless of whether the person clicks on a YouTube video or not.
If such transmission of this information to YouTube and Google is not wanted by the person visiting our site, they can prevent the transmission by logging out of their YouTube account before visiting our website.

YouTubeâs privacy policy, available at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/, identifies the collection, processing, and use of personally identifiable information by YouTube and Google.

We also take appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or total loss, destruction or unauthorized access by third parties.
Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments.

## 10. Updating and changing this privacy policy

This privacy policy is currently valid and is valid as of 2025-01-16.

As a result of the further development of our website and offers thereof, or due to changed legal or official requirements, it may be necessary to change this privacy policy.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 1419-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
December 5th, 2007                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : openoffice.org, hsqldb
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-4575

A vulnerability has been discovered in HSQLDB, the default database
engine shipped with OpenOffice.org.  This could result in the
execution of arbitrary Java code embedded in a OpenOffice.org database
document with the user's privilege.  This update requires an update of
both openoffice.org and hsqldb.

The old stable distribution (sarge) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.4.dfsg.2-7etch4 of OpenOffice.org and in version
1.8.0.7-1etch1 of hsqldb.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.1-1 of OpenOffice.org and in version 1.8.0.9-2 of hsqldb.

For the experimental distribution this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.1~rc1-1 of OpenOffice.org and in version 1.8.0.9-1 of
hsqldb.

We recommend that you upgrade your OpenOffice.org and hsqldb packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given at the end of this advisory:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
