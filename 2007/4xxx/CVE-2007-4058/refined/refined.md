- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `StartProcess` method in `vielib.dll` does not properly validate the caller, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control, allowing invocation of sensitive functionality from untrusted sources.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application, potentially allowing full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can craft a malicious HTML page that leverages the vulnerable `StartProcess` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to open the crafted HTML file, typically through a web browser.
