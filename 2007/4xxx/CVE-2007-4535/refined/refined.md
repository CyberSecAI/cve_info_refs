Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Vavoom related to CVE-2007-4535:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **A] Say format string:**
    *   **Root Cause:** A format string vulnerability exists in the `Say` command handler within `sv_main.cpp`. When a user sends a chat message, the `BroadcastPrintf` function is called, passing the user's name and message directly as the format string, without proper sanitization or using it as an argument.
    *   **Weakness:**  The `BroadcastPrintf` function in `p_thinker.cpp` takes a format string as input, which is then used in `vsprintf` without proper validation.
    *   **Impact:** This allows a malicious user to inject format string specifiers (e.g., `%n`, `%s`) into their chat messages. This can lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting memory locations.

*   **B] BroadcastPrintf buffer-overflow:**
    *   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability is present in the `BroadcastPrintf` function itself (`p_thinker.cpp`).
    *   **Weakness:** The `BroadcastPrintf` function copies formatted output into a fixed-size buffer (`buf[1024]`) using `vsprintf`, without checking if the formatted string exceeds the buffer size.
    *  **Impact:** If the formatted string is longer than 1024 bytes, a buffer overflow occurs, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

*   **C] "NewLen >= 0" assertion failed:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  An assertion failure in the `VStr::Resize` function (`str.cpp`) can be triggered by providing a negative value for the `NewLen` parameter.
    *   **Weakness:** The `VStr::Resize` function checks if NewLen is greater or equal to 0, but this check can be bypassed with crafted input.
    *   **Impact:** This can cause the server to crash, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **A] & B]:** Remote, through sending crafted chat messages to a vulnerable Vavoom server.
*   **C]:** Remote, by sending a crafted UDP packet to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **A] & B]:** The attacker must be able to connect to a Vavoom server and send chat messages.
*   **C]:** The attacker must be able to send UDP packets to the server (port 26000).

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory states that the format string and buffer overflow vulnerabilities (A and B) could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   The provided advisory includes details of the code locations and how to exploit each bug.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry confirms these issues and states that they were addressed in version 1.24-3.fc7. It also categorizes the impact of the vulnerabilities as critical.
*   The exploit for "A]" is to send a chat message containing format string specifiers, such as %n%n%n%n%s.
*  The exploit for "B]" is to send a chat message with a long string of characters to cause a buffer overflow.
*   The exploit for "C]" involves sending a specific UDP packet with hex bytes `80 02 ff 00`.
