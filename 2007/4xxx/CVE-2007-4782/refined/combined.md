How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# PHP: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200710-02**

PHP contains several vulnerabilities including buffer and integer overflows
which could lead to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/php** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.2.4\_p20070914-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.2.4\_p20070914-r2** |

### Background

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

### Description

Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP. Mattias Bengtsson and Philip
Olausson reported integer overflows in the gdImageCreate() and
gdImageCreateTrueColor() functions of the GD library which can cause
heap-based buffer overflows (CVE-2007-3996). Gerhard Wagner discovered
an integer overflow in the chunk\_split() function that can lead to a
heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2007-2872). Its incomplete fix caused
incorrect buffer size calculation due to precision loss, also resulting
in a possible heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2007-4661 and
CVE-2007-4660). A buffer overflow in the sqlite\_decode\_binary() of the
SQLite extension found by Stefan Esser that was addressed in PHP 5.2.1
was not fixed correctly (CVE-2007-1887).

Stefan Esser discovered an error in the zend\_alter\_ini\_entry() function
handling a memory\_limit violation (CVE-2007-4659). Stefan Esser also
discovered a flaw when handling interruptions with userspace error
handlers that can be exploited to read arbitrary heap memory
(CVE-2007-1883). Disclosure of sensitive memory can also be triggered
due to insufficient boundary checks in the strspn() and strcspn()
functions, an issue discovered by Mattias Bengtsson and Philip Olausson
(CVE-2007-4657)

Stefan Esser reported incorrect validation in the FILTER\_VALIDATE\_EMAIL
filter of the Filter extension allowing arbitrary email header
injection (CVE-2007-1900). NOTE: This CVE was referenced, but not fixed
in GLSA 200705-19.

Stanislav Malyshev found an error with unknown impact in the
money\_format() function when processing "%i" and "%n" tokens
(CVE-2007-4658). zatanzlatan reported a buffer overflow in the
php\_openssl\_make\_REQ() function with unknown impact when providing a
manipulated SSL configuration file (CVE-2007-4662). Possible memory
corruption when trying to read EXIF data in exif\_read\_data() and
exif\_thumbnail() occurred with unknown impact.

Several vulnerabilities that allow bypassing of open\_basedir and other
restrictions were reported, including the glob() function
(CVE-2007-4663), the session\_save\_path(), ini\_set(), and error\_log()
functions which can allow local command execution (CVE-2007-3378),
involving the readfile() function (CVE-2007-3007), via the Session
extension (CVE-2007-4652), via the MySQL extension (CVE-2007-3997) and
in the dl() function which allows loading extensions outside of the
specified directory (CVE-2007-4825).

Multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities were discovered, including a
long "library" parameter in the dl() function (CVE-2007-4887), in
several iconv and xmlrpc functions (CVE-2007-4840 and CVE-2007-4783),
in the setlocale() function (CVE-2007-4784), in the glob() and
fnmatch() function (CVE-2007-4782 and CVE-2007-3806), a floating point
exception in the wordwrap() function (CVE-2007-3998), a stack
exhaustion via deeply nested arrays (CVE-2007-4670), an infinite loop
caused by a specially crafted PNG image in the png\_read\_info() function
of libpng (CVE-2007-2756) and several issues related to array
conversion.

### Impact

Remote attackers might be able to exploit these issues in PHP
applications making use of the affected functions, potentially
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code, Denial of Service,
execution of scripted contents in the context of the affected site,
security bypass or information leak.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PHP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/php-5.2.4_p20070914-r2"
```

## Details

It was discovered that PHP did not properly check the length of the

string parameter to the fnmatch function. An attacker could cause a

denial of service in the PHP interpreter if a script passed untrusted

input to the fnmatch function. ([CVE-2007-4782](/security/CVE-2007-4782))

Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered a flaw in the cURL library that

allowed safe\_mode and open\_basedir restrictions to be bypassed. If a

PHP application were tricked into processing a bad file:// request,

an attacker could read arbitrary files. ([CVE-2007-4850](/security/CVE-2007-4850))

Rasmus Lerdorf discovered that the htmlentities and htmlspecialchars

functions did not correctly stop when handling partial multibyte

sequences. A remote attacker could exploit this to read certain areas

of memory, possibly gaining access to sensitive information. This

issue affects Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, and an updated fix is included for

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-5898](/security/CVE-2007-5898))

It was discovered that the output\_add\_rewrite\_var function would

sometimes leak session id information to forms targeting remote URLs.

Malicious remote sites could use this information to gain access to a

PHP application user's login credentials. This issue only affects

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2007-5899](/security/CVE-2007-5899))

It was discovered that PHP did not properly calculate the length of

PATH\_TRANSLATED. If a PHP application were tricked into processing

a malicious URI, and attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code

with application privileges. ([CVE-2008-0599](/security/CVE-2008-0599))

An integer overflow was discovered in the php\_sprintf\_appendstring

function. Attackers could exploit this to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2008-1384](/security/CVE-2008-1384))

Andrei Nigmatulin discovered stack-based overflows in the FastCGI SAPI

of PHP. An attacker may be able to leverage this issue to perform

attacks against PHP applications. ([CVE-2008-2050](/security/CVE-2008-2050))

It was discovered that the escapeshellcmd did not properly process

multibyte characters. An attacker may be able to bypass quoting

restrictions and possibly execute arbitrary code with application

privileges. ([CVE-2008-2051](/security/CVE-2008-2051))

It was discovered that the GENERATE\_SEED macro produced a predictable

seed under certain circumstances. Attackers may by able to easily

predict the results of the rand and mt\_rand functions.

([CVE-2008-2107](/security/CVE-2008-2107), [CVE-2008-2108](/security/CVE-2008-2108))

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the PCRE library did not correctly

handle certain in-pattern options. An attacker could cause PHP

applications using pcre to crash, leading to a denial of service.

USN-624-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the pcre3 library. This update

provides the corresponding update for PHP. ([CVE-2008-2371](/security/CVE-2008-2371))

It was discovered that php\_imap used obsolete API calls. If a PHP

application were tricked into processing a malicious IMAP request,

an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute code

with application privileges. ([CVE-2008-2829](/security/CVE-2008-2829))

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
php5 was updated to version 5.2.5 to fix several security
vulnerabilities. For php4 on SLES9 the patches were backported.
- php4 on SLES9 and php5 on SLES10/10.1 contained a copy of the pcre
library which was vulnerable to several security issues. On SLES9
the included library was patched. SLES10/10.1 now uses the system
pcre library. 10.2 and 10.3 already used the system pcre library
before.

2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of the apache web
server after the update if you use mod\_php.
Note that due to the version upgrade on 10.2 some defaults in
/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini changed. Especially the change of the
default value of the 'short\_open\_tag' setting could cause problems
with some applications. Please check that setting if you run into
problems.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.
