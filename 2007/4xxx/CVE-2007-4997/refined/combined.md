How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Packages

* [linux-source-2.6.15](/security/cves?package=linux-source-2.6.15) -

## Details

The minix filesystem did not properly validate certain filesystem

values. If a local attacker could trick the system into attempting

to mount a corrupted minix filesystem, the kernel could be made to

hang for long periods of time, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2006-6058](/security/CVE-2006-6058))

Alexander Schulze discovered that the skge driver does not properly

use the spin\_lock and spin\_unlock functions. Remote attackers could

exploit this by sending a flood of network traffic and cause a denial

of service (crash). ([CVE-2006-7229](/security/CVE-2006-7229))

Hugh Dickins discovered that hugetlbfs performed certain prio\_tree

calculations using HPAGE\_SIZE instead of PAGE\_SIZE. A local user

could exploit this and cause a denial of service via kernel panic.

([CVE-2007-4133](/security/CVE-2007-4133))

Chris Evans discovered an issue with certain drivers that use the

ieee80211\_rx function. Remote attackers could send a crafted 802.11

frame and cause a denial of service via crash. ([CVE-2007-4997](/security/CVE-2007-4997))

Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam

devices. A local user with physical access to the system could remove

the device while a userspace application had it open and cause the USB

subsystem to block. ([CVE-2007-5093](/security/CVE-2007-5093))

Scott James Remnant discovered a coding error in ptrace. Local users

could exploit this and cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop.

([CVE-2007-5500](/security/CVE-2007-5500))

Venustech AD-LAB discovered a buffer overflow in the isdn net

subsystem. This issue is exploitable by local users via crafted input

to the isdn\_ioctl function. ([CVE-2007-6063](/security/CVE-2007-6063))

It was discovered that the isdn subsystem did not properly check for

NULL termination when performing ioctl handling. A local user could

exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-6151](/security/CVE-2007-6151))

Blake Frantz discovered that when a root process overwrote an existing

core file, the resulting core file retained the previous core file's

ownership. Local users could exploit this to gain access to sensitive

information. ([CVE-2007-6206](/security/CVE-2007-6206))

Hugh Dickins discovered the when using the tmpfs filesystem, under

rare circumstances, a kernel page may be improperly cleared. A local

user may be able to exploit this and read sensitive kernel data or

cause a denial of service via crash. ([CVE-2007-6417](/security/CVE-2007-6417))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-386,

linux-powerpc, linux-amd64-generic), a standard system upgrade will

automatically perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

The minix filesystem did not properly validate certain filesystem

values. If a local attacker could trick the system into attempting

to mount a corrupted minix filesystem, the kernel could be made to

hang for long periods of time, resulting in a denial of service.

This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2006-6058](/security/CVE-2006-6058))

The signal handling on PowerPC systems using HTX allowed local users

to cause a denial of service via floating point corruption. This was

only vulnerable in Ubuntu 6.10 and 7.04. ([CVE-2007-3107](/security/CVE-2007-3107))

The Linux kernel did not properly validate the hop-by-hop IPv6

extended header. Remote attackers could send a crafted IPv6 packet

and cause a denial of service via kernel panic. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04. ([CVE-2007-4567](/security/CVE-2007-4567))

The JFFS2 filesystem with ACL support enabled did not properly store

permissions during inode creation and ACL setting. Local users could

possibly access restricted files after a remount. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-4849](/security/CVE-2007-4849))

Chris Evans discovered an issue with certain drivers that use the

ieee80211\_rx function. Remote attackers could send a crafted 802.11

frame and cause a denial of service via crash. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-4997](/security/CVE-2007-4997))

Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam

devices. A local user with physical access to the system could remove

the device while a userspace application had it open and cause the USB

subsystem to block. This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04.

([CVE-2007-5093](/security/CVE-2007-5093))

Scott James Remnant discovered a coding error in ptrace. Local users

could exploit this and cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop.

This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-5500](/security/CVE-2007-5500))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel could dereference a NULL

pointer when processing certain IPv4 TCP packets. A remote attacker

could send a crafted TCP ACK response and cause a denial of service

via crash. This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.10. ([CVE-2007-5501](/security/CVE-2007-5501))

Warren Togami discovered that the hrtimer subsystem did not properly

check for large relative timeouts. A local user could exploit this and

cause a denial of service via soft lockup. ([CVE-2007-5966](/security/CVE-2007-5966))

Venustech AD-LAB discovered a buffer overflow in the isdn net

subsystem. This issue is exploitable by local users via crafted input

to the isdn\_ioctl function. ([CVE-2007-6063](/security/CVE-2007-6063))

It was discovered that the isdn subsystem did not properly check for

NULL termination when performing ioctl handling. A local user could

exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-6151](/security/CVE-2007-6151))

Blake Frantz discovered that when a root process overwrote an existing

core file, the resulting core file retained the previous core file's

ownership. Local users could exploit this to gain access to sensitive

information. ([CVE-2007-6206](/security/CVE-2007-6206))

Hugh Dickins discovered the when using the tmpfs filesystem, under

rare circumstances, a kernel page may be improperly cleared. A local

user may be able to exploit this and read sensitive kernel data or

cause a denial of service via crash. ([CVE-2007-6417](/security/CVE-2007-6417))

Bill Roman discovered that the VFS subsystem did not properly check

access modes. A local user may be able to gain removal privileges on

directories. ([CVE-2008-0001](/security/CVE-2008-0001))

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This kernel update fixes the following security problems:
- CVE-2007-3104: The sysfs\_readdir function in the Linux kernel 2.6
allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel OOPS)
by dereferencing a null pointer to an inode in a dentry.
- CVE-2007-4997: A 2 byte buffer underflow in the ieee80211 stack
was fixed, which might be used by attackers in the local WLAN reach
to crash the machine.
- CVE-2007-3740: The CIFS filesystem, when Unix extension support is
enabled, did not honor the umask of a process, which allowed local
users to gain privileges.
- CVE-2007-4573: It was possible for local user to become root by
exploiting a bug in the IA32 system call emulation. This problem
affects the x86\_64 platform only, on all distributions.
This problem was fixed for regular kernels, but had not been fixed
for the XEN kernels. This update fixes the problem also for the
XEN kernels.
- CVE-2007-4308: The (1) aac\_cfg\_open and (2) aac\_compat\_ioctl
functions in the SCSI layer ioctl path in aacraid did not check
permissions for ioctls, which might have allowed local users to
cause a denial of service or gain privileges.
- CVE-2007-3843: The Linux kernel checked the wrong global variable
for the CIFS sec mount option, which might allow remote attackers to
spoof CIFS network traffic that the client configured for security
signatures, as demonstrated by lack of signing despite sec=ntlmv2i
in a SetupAndX request.
- CVE-2007-5904: Multiple buffer overflows in CIFS VFS in the Linux
kernel allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
and possibly execute arbitrary code via long SMB responses that
trigger the overflows in the SendReceive function.
This requires the attacker to mis-present / replace a CIFS server
the client machine is connected to.
Also the exploitability of this problem is not known.
- CVE-2007-6063: Buffer overflow in the isdn\_net\_setcfg function in
isdn\_net.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to have an
unknown impact via a crafted argument to the isdn\_ioctl function.

2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

The minix filesystem did not properly validate certain filesystem values.

If a local attacker could trick the system into attempting to mount a

corrupted minix filesystem, the kernel could be made to hang for long

periods of time, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2006-6058](/security/CVE-2006-6058))

Certain calculations in the hugetlb code were not correct. A local

attacker could exploit this to cause a kernel panic, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2007-4133](/security/CVE-2007-4133))

Eric Sesterhenn and Victor Julien discovered that the hop-by-hop IPv6

extended header was not correctly validated. If a system was configured

for IPv6, a remote attacker could send a specially crafted IPv6 packet

and cause the kernel to panic, leading to a denial of service. This

was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04. ([CVE-2007-4567](/security/CVE-2007-4567))

Permissions were not correctly stored on JFFS2 ACLs. For systems using

ACLs on JFFS2, a local attacker may gain access to private files.

([CVE-2007-4849](/security/CVE-2007-4849))

Chris Evans discovered that the 802.11 network stack did not correctly

handle certain QOS frames. A remote attacker on the local wireless network

could send specially crafted packets that would panic the kernel, resulting

in a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-4997](/security/CVE-2007-4997))

The Philips USB Webcam driver did not correctly handle disconnects.

If a local attacker tricked another user into disconnecting a webcam

unsafely, the kernel could hang or consume CPU resources, leading to

a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-5093](/security/CVE-2007-5093))

Scott James Remnant discovered that the waitid function could be made

to hang the system. A local attacker could execute a specially crafted

program which would leave the system unresponsive, resulting in a denial

of service. ([CVE-2007-5500](/security/CVE-2007-5500))

Ilpo Järvinen discovered that it might be possible for the TCP stack

to panic the kernel when receiving a crafted ACK response. Only Ubuntu

7.10 contained the vulnerable code, and it is believed not to have

been exploitable. ([CVE-2007-5501](/security/CVE-2007-5501))

When mounting the same remote NFS share to separate local locations, the

first location's mount options would apply to all subsequent mounts of the

same NFS share. In some configurations, this could lead to incorrectly

configured permissions, allowing local users to gain additional access

to the mounted share. (<https://launchpad.net/bugs/164231>)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Linux kernel contained various security problems for which we
released updates.
This round of updates covers kernels for following product families:
- SUSE Linux Enterprise 10
- SUSE Linux 10.1
- openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
This kernel update fixes the following security problems:
CVE-2008-0007: Insufficient range checks in certain fault handlers
could be used by local attackers to potentially read or write kernel
memory. (all)
CVE-2008-0001: Incorrect access mode checks could be used by local
attackers to corrupt directory contents and so cause denial of service
attacks or potentially execute code. (all) Please note that this
problem does not affect SLES 9 or SLES 8.
CVE-2007-5966: Integer overflow in the hrtimer\_start function in
kernel/hrtimer.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.23.10 allows local
users to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (panic)
via a large relative timeout value. (all)
CVE-2007-3843: The Linux kernel checked the wrong global variable
for the CIFS sec mount option, which might allow remote attackers to
spoof CIFS network traffic that the client configured for security
signatures, as demonstrated by lack of signing despite sec=ntlmv2i
in a SetupAndX request. (openSUSE 10.2, 10.3)
CVE-2007-2242: The IPv6 protocol allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service via crafted IPv6 type 0 route headers
(IPV6\_RTHDR\_TYPE\_0) that create network amplification between two
routers. A non-kABI breaking patch has now been applied to all
product trees.
CVE-2007-6417: The shmem\_getpage function (mm/shmem.c) in Linux kernel
2.6.11 through 2.6.23 does not properly clear allocated memory in some
rare circumstances, which might allow local users to read sensitive
kernel data or cause a denial of service (crash). (all)
CVE-2007-4308: The (1) aac\_cfg\_open and (2) aac\_compat\_ioctl functions
in the SCSI layer ioctl path in aacraid in the Linux kernel did not
check permissions for ioctls, which might have allowed local users
to cause a denial of service or gain privileges. (openSUSE 10.2)
CVE-2007-3740: The CIFS filesystem, when Unix extension support is
enabled, does not honor the umask of a process, which allows local
users to gain privileges. (openSUSE 10.2)
CVE-2007-3848: The Linux kernel allowed local users to send
arbitrary signals to a child process that is running at higher
privileges by causing a setuid-root parent process to die, which
delivers an attacker-controlled parent process death signal
(PR\_SET\_PDEATHSIG). (openSUSE 10.2)
CVE-2007-4997: Integer underflow in the ieee80211\_rx function in
net/ieee80211/ieee80211\_rx.c in the Linux kernel allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted SKB length
value in a runt IEEE 802.11 frame when the IEEE80211\_STYPE\_QOS\_DATA
flag is set, aka an "off-by-two error." (openSUSE 10.2)
CVE-2007-6063: Buffer overflow in the isdn\_net\_setcfg function in
isdn\_net.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to have an unknown
impact via a crafted argument to the isdn\_ioctl function. (openSUSE
10.2)
A failed AppArmor change\_hat system call can result in an apparmored
task becoming unconfined (326546). (openSUSE 10.2)
Also quite a number of non-security bugs were fixed.
The openSUSE 10.3 kernel update was reissued twice, the second time
to fix a regression with CPU Frequency handling on Laptops.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Reboot the machine after the update was installed.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
