  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-4546",
      "root_cause": "The application fails to properly validate user-supplied input when processing ZIP and RAR archives.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Directory traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input validation of filenames within ZIP and RAR archives.",
        "Filename spoofing vulnerability due to discrepancies between the displayed filename and the actual filename used during extraction in ZIP archives."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can create malicious ZIP/RAR archives that, when extracted by Unreal Commander, can overwrite system files or place malware in arbitrary locations on the file system, leading to full system compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Maliciously crafted ZIP archives containing directory traversal sequences in the central directory file names.",
         "Maliciously crafted RAR archives containing directory traversal sequences in the file names.",
        "Maliciously crafted ZIP archives with discrepancies between filenames in local headers and central directories."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malformed ZIP or RAR archive. The user needs to be tricked into extracting it using Unreal Commander.",
      "additional_details": [
        "The directory traversal vulnerability is present in both ZIP and RAR archive processing.",
         "The ZIP name spoofing vulnerability could trick users into extracting dangerous file types, such as .ani files."
