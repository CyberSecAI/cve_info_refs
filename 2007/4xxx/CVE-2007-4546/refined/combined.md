Security Advisory
http://blog.hispasec.com/lab/
Name : X-Diesel Unreal Commander v0.92 (build 573) multiple
vulnerabilities
Class : Local/Remote multiple directory traversal (Input
Validation Error)
Threat level : HIGH
Discovered : 2007-08-09
Published : 2007-08-23
Credit : Gynvael Coldwind
Vulnerable : 0.92 (build 573), 0.92 (build 565), prior also may be affected
== Abstract ==
Unreal Commander is an award winning freeware file manager for Windows
98/ME/2000/XP/2003/Vista. The application support multiple archive
formats, has a built-in ftp client, and other features.
Unreal Commander fails to check user-supplied input while processing
ZIP and RAR archives. A malformed ZIP or RAR file can be used to
perform a directory traversal attack and place malware files in a
location selected by the attacker. Successful exploitation can lead to
a full compromitation of the system.
== Details ==
1. ZIP directory traversal
The file name in a ZIP archive in the central directory can be
malformed so that it contains upwards directory traversal, for
example:
Something/../../../../../../Program Files/Something/ws2\_32.dll
If the user upacks such an archive, the Unreal Commander will create
the file ws2\_32.dll in the specified directory, instead of the
directory where the user wants to extract it. This may lead to system
compromitation, especially if the user executes Unreal Commander with
admin privileges.
PoC: http://blog.hispasec.com/lab/files/UnrealCommander\_PoC\_traversal.zip
2. ZIP name spoofing
A ZIP archive contains two places where a file's name is written:
Local file header and Central Directory. Unreal Commander displays the
file name according to the Central Directory, but extracts the file
with the name from the Local File Header. This is may misinform the
user about the files contained in the archive. This can help an
attacker to trick the user into extracting a dangerous file (for
example, an .ani file on an unpacked Windows).
PoC: http://blog.hispasec.com/lab/files/UnrealCommander\_PoC\_spoof.zip
3. ZIP file size heap information leak
If the ZIP has a malformed file size in the file header, then Unreal
Commander writes to the file data from the heap. This could allow
potential information leak (ftp passwords ?), but this has not been
confirmed.
4. RAR directory traversal
Like point 1, but regarding to RAR format.
== Vendor status and solution ==
The vendor has been informed, but has not yet released a proper patch.
The solution is to check if a RAR or ZIP file contains ".." in the
names of the files in the archives. It is also advised not to run
Unreal Commander with administrative privileges.
