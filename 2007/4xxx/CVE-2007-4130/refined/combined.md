| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=179665#c0)  Doug Chapman    2006-02-01 22:56:01 UTC  ``` From Bugzilla Helper: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4  Description of problem: The following simple reproducer causes a panic on ia64 when run as any user.  Due to this I am considering this a security sensitive problem.  This is another situation where bad arguments to set_mempolicy causes a system panic.  I have verified this on ia64 running the latest kernel however it is likey not a recent regression.  I have not had a chance to dig into the code to narrow down the issue but it is easily reproducable (on ia64 at least, would be interested in seeing if it can be hit elsewhere).

I tried this on the latest upstream kernel (2.6.16-rc1) and did not see the panic.     ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=179665#c4)  Doug Chapman    2006-02-10 18:40:23 UTC  ``` Did some investigation of the code:  During the page fault a new page is in the process of being allocated but this fails and returns NULL way down in alloc_pages_current when it calls zonelist_policy because current->policy->v.zonelist[0] == NULL  This is set when we do the set_mempolicy because we are sending it a NULL mask (as we have seen with other set_mempoilcy bugs other invalid masks are likely to do break as well).  sys_set_mempolicy calls mpol_new which calls bind_zonelist  In bind_zonelist since it doesn't find any bits set in the "nodes" bitmask sets zl->zones[num] = NULL; (where num is 0 since we made no iterations of the for loop).  There is a check in mpol_new for the MPOL_BIND case where it checks that policy->v.zonelist is not null after calling bind_zonelist.  Perhaps we should return EINVAL if policy->v.zonelist[0] is NULL here as well.     ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=179665#c5)  Ernie Petrides    2006-08-14 23:44:53 UTC  ``` Neither of the two reproducers above cause any harm on x86_64.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=179665#c6)  Doug Chapman    2006-08-31 19:55:52 UTC  ``` I am still able to reproduce this in RHEL4 U4 kernel-2.6.9-42.EL    ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=179665#c7)  Luming Yu    2007-08-13 06:57:53 UTC  ``` I still can see the problem with the most recent rhel 4 kernel.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=179665#c0)  Doug Chapman    2006-02-01 22:56:01 UTC  ``` From Bugzilla Helper: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4  Description of problem: The following simple reproducer causes a panic on ia64 when run as any user.  Due to this I am considering this a security sensitive problem.  This is another situation where bad arguments to set_mempolicy causes a system panic.  I have verified this on ia64 running the latest kernel however it is likey not a recent regression.  I have not had a chance to dig into the code to narrow down the issue but it is easily reproducable (on ia64 at least, would be interested in seeing if it can be hit elsewhere).

Additional info:   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=179665#c3)  Doug Chapman    2006-02-01 23:08:08 UTC  ``` One important point I neglected to mention.  I tried this on the latest upstream kernel (2.6.16-rc1) and did not see the panic.     ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=179665#c4)  Doug Chapman    2006-02-10 18:40:23 UTC  ``` Did some investigation of the code:  During the page fault a new page is in the process of being allocated but this fails and returns NULL way down in alloc_pages_current when it calls zonelist_policy because current->policy->v.zonelist[0] == NULL  This is set when we do the set_mempolicy because we are sending it a NULL mask (as we have seen with other set_mempoilcy bugs other invalid masks are likely to do break as well).  sys_set_mempolicy calls mpol_new which calls bind_zonelist  In bind_zonelist since it doesn't find any bits set in the "nodes" bitmask sets zl->zones[num] = NULL; (where num is 0 since we made no iterations of the for loop).  There is a check in mpol_new for the MPOL_BIND case where it checks that policy->v.zonelist is not null after calling bind_zonelist.  Perhaps we should return EINVAL if policy->v.zonelist[0] is NULL here as well.     ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=179665#c5)  Ernie Petrides    2006-08-14 23:44:53 UTC  ``` Neither of the two reproducers above cause any harm on x86_64.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=179665#c6)  Doug Chapman    2006-08-31 19:55:52 UTC  ``` I am still able to reproduce this in RHEL4 U4 kernel-2.6.9-42.EL    ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=179665#c7)  Luming Yu    2007-08-13 06:57:53 UTC  ``` I still can see the problem with the most recent rhel 4 kernel.

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues and a bug in the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 kernel are now available.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

These updated kernel packages fix the following security issues:

A flaw was found in the virtual filesystem (VFS). A local unprivileged
user could truncate directories to which they had write permission; this
could render the contents of the directory inaccessible. (CVE-2008-0001,
Important)

A flaw was found in the implementation of ptrace. A local unprivileged user
could trigger this flaw and possibly cause a denial of service (system
hang). (CVE-2007-5500, Important)

A flaw was found in the way the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 kernel handled
page faults when a CPU used the NUMA method for accessing memory on Itanium
architectures. A local unprivileged user could trigger this flaw and cause
a denial of service (system panic). (CVE-2007-4130, Important)

A possible NULL pointer dereference was found in the chrp\_show\_cpuinfo
function when using the PowerPC architecture. This may have allowed a local
unprivileged user to cause a denial of service (crash).
(CVE-2007-6694, Moderate)

A flaw was found in the way core dump files were created. If a local user
can get a root-owned process to dump a core file into a directory, which
the user has write access to, they could gain read access to that core
file. This could potentially grant unauthorized access to sensitive
information. (CVE-2007-6206, Moderate)

Two buffer overflow flaws were found in the Linux kernel ISDN subsystem. A
local unprivileged user could use these flaws to cause a denial of
service. (CVE-2007-6063, CVE-2007-6151, Moderate)

As well, these updated packages fix the following bug:

* when moving volumes that contain multiple segments, and a mirror segment

is not the first in the mapping table, running the "pvmove /dev/[device]
/dev/[device]" command caused a kernel panic. A "kernel: Unable to handle
kernel paging request at virtual address [address]" error was logged by
syslog.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=382161#c2)  Mark J. Cox    2007-11-14 11:29:26 UTC  ``` Roland said:  Vanilla 2.6.9 is not affected, but RHEL4 probably is.  It has backported the relevant changes from the later upstream code so it probably behaves like the vanilla upstream kernel does now.  RHEL5 is probably not affected.  It has the ptrace subsystem replaced such that I think this code path no longer involved in the cases that can trigger the problem.    ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=382161#c5)  Mark J. Cox    2007-11-14 11:38:25 UTC  ``` Roland wrote:  ....The original "if (p->state > TASK_STOPPED)" line predated the introduction of TASK_TRACED.  When written, it was a correct test for what we now write as "if (p->exit_state)".  The patch below is the minimal necessary change to restore the original sense of the test intended and correct the pathological behavior of this test case.  This seems like the right thing to put in right away.  (I tested it with the case you forwarded.)  That covers the "security" problem, such as it is.  (It doesn't seem really exploitable to me, since if you kill all the traced processes it still dies, no permanent leaks or anything.)  Later we can get into what the check is there for at all and clean that up right.....  --- [PATCH] wait_task_stopped: Check p->exit_state instead of TASK_TRACED  The original meaning of the old test (p->state > TASK_STOPPED) was "not dead", since it was before TASK_TRACED existed and before the state/exit_state split.  It was a wrong correction in commit 14bf01bb0599c89fc7f426d20353b76e12555308 to make this test for TASK_TRACED instead.  It should have been changed when TASK_TRACED was introducted and again when exit_state was introduced.

"The spin occurs inside sys_waitid (1696..1729) when called with the WNOWAIT option and a signal from a ptraced process to be waited upon; the syscall never exits, so depending on the kernel state, the effect can be anything from a process spinning to a full system hang."   ``` |  |
