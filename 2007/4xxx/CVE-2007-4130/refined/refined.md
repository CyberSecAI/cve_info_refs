{
  "CVE-2007-4130": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the way the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 kernel handled page faults when a CPU used the NUMA method for accessing memory on Itanium architectures. Specifically, a NULL mask was being passed to `set_mempolicy` during page allocation which resulted in a NULL pointer dereference.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the kernel when handling page faults in NUMA environments on Itanium architectures.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A local unprivileged user can trigger a denial of service (system panic).",
      "Attack vectors": "Local unprivileged users can exploit the vulnerability.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a local user on the affected system."
