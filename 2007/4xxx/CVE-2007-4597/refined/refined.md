Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `search` script of SunShop Shopping Cart 4.0 RC 6, specifically in the `s[cid]` parameter. This parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not directly reveal the results of the SQL injection. Instead, the attacker must infer the results based on the application's behavior (in this case, whether a specific string "Add To Cart" appears in the response).
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The `s[cid]` parameter doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected and executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and potentially other data. The provided exploit specifically targets the `admins` table.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The exploit uses a crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `index.php` with specific parameters including the vulnerable `s[cid]` parameter.
*   **URL Parameter Injection:** The SQL injection is performed by injecting malicious SQL code into the `s[cid]` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker needs to know the base URL of the application, along with the ID of the admin user to extract their data. Knowledge of the admin table name is also helpful but the script defaults to `admins`.
*   **Basic Programming Skills:** A basic understanding of scripting and SQL is needed to formulate the exploit.
*   **Use of Exploit Tools:**  The provided exploit script can be used directly or modified.

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit uses a blind SQL injection technique, which requires multiple requests to extract information.
* The exploit script provides options to target different columns (`username` or `password`), and modify the table name.
* The vulnerability can be fixed by upgrading to version 4.0.1 of SunShop.

This vulnerability is a classic example of a blind SQL injection vulnerability, which can lead to the complete compromise of a web application if exploited successfully.
