# 2.20.4, 2.22.2, and 3.0 Security Advisory

Thursday, Aug 23rd, 2007
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* A possible cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when filing bugs
  using the guided form.

* When using email_in.pl, insufficiently escaped data may be passed to
  sendmail.

* Users using the WebService interface may access Bugzilla's time-tracking
  fields even if they normally cannot see them.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.17.1 and above
Description: Bugzilla does not properly escape the 'buildid' field in
             the guided form when filing bugs. From 2.17.1 till 2.23.3,
             this field was based exclusively on the User-Agent string
             returned by your web browser. Since 2.23.4, this parameter
             can be defined in the URL passed to enter_bug.cgi, overwriting
             the User-Agent string and may lead to cross-site scripting.
             The guided form is not usually used by Bugzilla installations,
             as it is shipped only as an example to be modified for their
             own use.

Class:       Command Injection
Affected:    2.23.4 and above
Description: Bugzilla 2.23.4 and newer use the Email:: modules instead
             of the Mail:: and MIME:: ones. The argument passed to the -f
             option of Email::Send::Sendmail() is insufficiently escaped
             and may lead to limited command injection when called from
             email_in.pl, a script which was also introduced in 2.23.4.

Class:       Information Leak
Affected:    2.23.3 and above
Description: Bugzilla's WebService (XML-RPC) interface allows you to access
             the time-tracking fields (such as Deadline, Estimated Time, etc.)
             on all bugs, even if you normally cannot access time-tracking
             fields.

Vulnerability Solutions
=======================

The fix for these issues is included in the
releases. Upgrading to a release with the relevant fix will
protect your installation from possible exploits of these issues.

If you are unable to upgrade but would like to patch just the security
vulnerability, there are patches available for the issues at the
"References" URL.

Full release downloads, patches to upgrade Bugzilla from previous
versions, and git upgrade instructions are available at:

  https://www.bugzilla.org/download/

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Bugzilla: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200709-18**

Bugzilla contains several vulnerabilities, some of them possibly leading to
the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/bugzilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.0.1** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **2.20.5**revision >= **2.22.3**>= **3.0.1**revision >= **2.22.5**revision >= **2.20.6** |

### Background

Bugzilla is a web application designed to help with managing software
development.

### Description

Masahiro Yamada found that from the 2.17.1 version, Bugzilla does not
properly sanitize the content of the "buildid" parameter when filing
bugs (CVE-2007-4543). The next two vulnerabilities only affect Bugzilla
2.23.3 or later, hence the stable Gentoo Portage tree does not contain
these two vulnerabilities: Loic Minier reported that the
"Email::Send::Sendmail()" function does not properly sanitise "from"
email information before sending it to the "-f" parameter of
/usr/sbin/sendmail (CVE-2007-4538), and Frederic Buclin discovered that
the XML-RPC interface does not correctly check permissions in the
time-tracking fields (CVE-2007-4539).

### Impact

A remote attacker could trigger the "buildid" vulnerability by sending
a specially crafted form to Bugzilla, leading to a persistent XSS, thus
allowing for theft of credentials. With Bugzilla 2.23.3 or later, an
attacker could also execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the
web server by injecting a specially crafted "from" email address and
gain access to normally restricted time-tracking information through
the XML-RPC service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Bugzilla users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose www-apps/bugzilla
```

While playing with contrib/bz\_webservice\_demo.pl, I realized that time related data are available even if you are logged out or logged in but not in the timetracking group. So it allows me to bypass some sec checks.Flags: blocking3.0.1?

since we have multiple places retrieving such data nowadays, shouldn't the perl modules (Bugzilla::Bug, etc) enforce this kind of stuff by not returning such data if the logged in user doesn't have access? I suppose there are places that need to be able to get at it anyway, so perhaps some sort of override flag for when you really want it, but that way it makes it obvious you're overriding the privs, too.

I think that's actually a good idea. But it'd be the kind of change that can't go into a branch. So we'd have to have a basic fix for the branch, and a comprehensive fix for upstream.

Hrm...yeah, this \*probably\* won't regress anything, but it's hard to tell.
Eventually we'll have to do this for UPDATE\_COLUMNS as well.
I don't really like entirely removing the information from the bug object, because I'm just worried about what that will do, but I suppose if it works fine and you don't find any regressions anywhere, it's OK.
Although for the branches, I'd rather go with a more direct method of fixing the WebService call itself.

patch, v1
At first I thought this would break Bugzilla::Bug->update, but then I realized that it's going to be comparing against a "new Bugzilla::Bug" that \*also\* doesn't have these fields, so it won't update them.
I'd rather see a more direct approach for the branches--I'm not thrilled with the idea of committing this patch to a branch.

If you have another idea for the 3.0 branch, feel free to attach a patch here.

OK, this patch breaks at least process\_bug.cgi on tip (didn't check yet on 3.0.1):
invalid bug attribute remaining\_time at Bugzilla/Bug.pm line 2944
Bugzilla::Bug::AUTOLOAD('Bugzilla::Bug=HASH(0x8ceddc4)') called at Bugzilla/Bug.pm line 2051

We still need to access the remaining\_time field for unprivileged users in case we have to reset the remaining time. So we have to find something else.Flags: approval?Whiteboard: [ready for 3.1][patch needed for 3.0?]

This patch is by far much safer than my previous fix as it only affects WebService/Bug.pm. There is no risk to regress anything in the core Bugzilla code. I tested it on both 3.0.1 and 3.1.1.

Oh, nevermind. :-) That's fine.
I'd recommend just deleting the fields from the bug, because that would make more sense to the user (and be less confusing if he was trying to figure out why he couldn't see them). But this is OK as it is, too.
