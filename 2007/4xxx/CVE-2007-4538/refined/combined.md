# Bugzilla: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200709-18**

Bugzilla contains several vulnerabilities, some of them possibly leading to
the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/bugzilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.0.1** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **2.20.5**revision >= **2.22.3**>= **3.0.1**revision >= **2.22.5**revision >= **2.20.6** |

### Background

Bugzilla is a web application designed to help with managing software
development.

### Description

Masahiro Yamada found that from the 2.17.1 version, Bugzilla does not
properly sanitize the content of the "buildid" parameter when filing
bugs (CVE-2007-4543). The next two vulnerabilities only affect Bugzilla
2.23.3 or later, hence the stable Gentoo Portage tree does not contain
these two vulnerabilities: Loic Minier reported that the
"Email::Send::Sendmail()" function does not properly sanitise "from"
email information before sending it to the "-f" parameter of
/usr/sbin/sendmail (CVE-2007-4538), and Frederic Buclin discovered that
the XML-RPC interface does not correctly check permissions in the
time-tracking fields (CVE-2007-4539).

### Impact

A remote attacker could trigger the "buildid" vulnerability by sending
a specially crafted form to Bugzilla, leading to a persistent XSS, thus
allowing for theft of credentials. With Bugzilla 2.23.3 or later, an
attacker could also execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the
web server by injecting a specially crafted "from" email address and
gain access to normally restricted time-tracking information through
the XML-RPC service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Bugzilla users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose www-apps/bugzilla
```

Thursday, Aug 23rd, 2007
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* A possible cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when filing bugs
  using the guided form.

* When using email_in.pl, insufficiently escaped data may be passed to
  sendmail.

* Users using the WebService interface may access Bugzilla's time-tracking
  fields even if they normally cannot see them.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.17.1 and above
Description: Bugzilla does not properly escape the 'buildid' field in
             the guided form when filing bugs. From 2.17.1 till 2.23.3,
             this field was based exclusively on the User-Agent string
             returned by your web browser. Since 2.23.4, this parameter
             can be defined in the URL passed to enter_bug.cgi, overwriting
             the User-Agent string and may lead to cross-site scripting.
             The guided form is not usually used by Bugzilla installations,
             as it is shipped only as an example to be modified for their
             own use.

Class:       Command Injection
Affected:    2.23.4 and above
Description: Bugzilla 2.23.4 and newer use the Email:: modules instead
             of the Mail:: and MIME:: ones. The argument passed to the -f
             option of Email::Send::Sendmail() is insufficiently escaped
             and may lead to limited command injection when called from
             email_in.pl, a script which was also introduced in 2.23.4.

Class:       Information Leak
Affected:    2.23.3 and above
Description: Bugzilla's WebService (XML-RPC) interface allows you to access
             the time-tracking fields (such as Deadline, Estimated Time, etc.)
             on all bugs, even if you normally cannot access time-tracking
             fields.

Vulnerability Solutions
=======================

The fix for these issues is included in the
releases. Upgrading to a release with the relevant fix will
protect your installation from possible exploits of these issues.

If you are unable to upgrade but would like to patch just the security
vulnerability, there are patches available for the issues at the
"References" URL.

Full release downloads, patches to upgrade Bugzilla from previous
versions, and git upgrade instructions are available at:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

email\_reply.pl performs insufficient escaping of arguments passed to sh -c sendmail. This might be remotely exploitable; setting security flag.
Long story: After some hours battling, I could get email\_reply.pm to run, but when passed valid mail data, it would fail with:
sh: -c: line 0: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
sh: -c: line 0: `/usr/lib/sendmail -t -oi -i -f<submit@bugzilla.example.com>'
The mail data looks something like:

I worked around this problem by adding single quotes to:
push(@args, "-f'$from'") if $from;
in Bugzilla/Mailer.pm, around line 80.
This is with version 2.181 of Email::Send as found in Debian stable (etch) in the libemail-send-perl package.
Note: email\_reply.pl still fails for me afterwards with:
sendmail: fatal: No recipient addresses found in message header

Do you mean Email::Reply? Or email\_in.pl?
Email::Reply isn't maintained by us, it's a CPAN module.
email\_in.pl is the name of the Bugzilla script.

I meant email\_in.pl, sorry for the typo; the actual bug seems to be in Bugzilla/Mailer.pm though.

Normally this isn't as much of a problem, because the only source of the mailfrom parameter is Bugzilla itself. However, in a shared hosting environment that would still be a problem.
In email\_in.pl, though, Email::Reply uses the "To" address as the "From" address for replies. So that's user-submitted data, and could be a problem.
The solution here is to use Email::Address to parse the $from when setting -f for sendmail, and just include the email address.
We probably should also do some escaping of common shell characters, but that's a bit trickier, since I don't know of any function or module that will do that for us.Severity: normal → majorStatus: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: trueFlags: blocking3.1.1+Flags: blocking3.0.1+Priority: -- → P1Summary: Insufficient escaping in email\_in.pl / Bugzilla/Mailer.pm → Insufficient escaping of From address when using email\_in.pl / sending emailsTarget Milestone: --- → Bugzilla 3.0

Ack on the analysis; I wasn't versed enough to use one the dozen of Email:: and
Mail:: functions to properly extract the email address, but I think email
address can be quite complex if you honor all RFC 822/2822 trickiness, so
without solid shell escaping, it is very risky.
As an alternate resolution, I suggest using the configured mailfrom instead of
reading the To:.
Should I file a separate issue for the remaining problem I get afterwards? It
seems due to a malformed email message text, presumably CRLF/LF mismatch in
line-endings since I see:
From: <submit@bugzilla.example.com>
^MTo: =?UTF-8?Q?Lo=C3=AFc=20Minier=20?=<lool@dooz.org>
^MSubject: Re: Essai
^MIn-Reply-To: <20070704151958.GD9800@bee.dooz.org>
...
in mailer.testfile (note the first line without \r); this doesn't look like a
security issue though.

I want to preserve the "To" that people wrote, in the actual email, but use just the email address on the command line.

Those look like a possible problem in Email::Reply. Perhaps contact the author of that module.

If I pass an invalid string, $email\_obj is undefined and you cannot call address(). You should probably write: |$email\_obj || return| or something like that.

Okay, further testing shows that this is not exploitable on 2.22 or 2.20, because we use Mail::Send there and it uses the multiple-argument form of exec().
It \*is\* exploitable on 3.0, since 2.23.4. (Actually since [bug 353711](/show_bug.cgi?id=353711 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move to Email:: modules for email sending").)
We may want to mention this to rjbs (the maintainer of Email::Send) to put in the POD for Email::Send::Sendmail.Version: unspecified → 2.23.4

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
