- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Input passed to the "subaction" and "action" parameters in "index.php" is not properly sanitized before being returned to the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Additionally, the "action" parameter can disclose the full path.  The "id" parameter is also vulnerable to SQL injection, but this requires being logged in.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Arbitrary HTML and script code can be executed in a user's browser session in the context of an affected site. Path disclosure can also be achieved.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through the "index.php" file, by manipulating the "subaction" and "action" parameters via a web request. SQL injection via the "id" parameter requires authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application to exploit the XSS and path disclosure vulnerabilities. Exploiting the SQL Injection requires the attacker to be a logged in user.
