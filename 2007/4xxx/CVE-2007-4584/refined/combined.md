# BitchX-1.1 Final MODE Heap Overflow [0-day]
# By bannedit
# Discovered May 16th 2007
# - Yet another overflow which can overwrite GOT
#
# I found this vuln after modifying ilja's ircfuzz
# code. Currently this exploit attempts to
# overwrite the GOT with the ret address to the
# shellcode.
#
# The actually vulnerability appears to be a stack
# overflow in p_mode. Due to input size restrictions
# the overflow can't occur on the stack because we can
# only overflow so much data. Luckily though we
# overwrite a structure containing pointers to heap
# data. This allows us to overwrite the GOT.
#
# Reliability of this exploit in its current stage is
# limited. There appears to be several factors which
# restrict the reliability.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# BitchX: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200807-12**

Multiple vulnerabilities in BitchX may allow for the remote execution of
arbitrary code or symlink attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-irc/bitchx** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.1-r4** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

BitchX is an IRC client.

### Description

bannedit reported a boundary error when handling overly long IRC MODE
messages (CVE-2007-4584). Nico Golde reported an insecure creation of a
temporary file within the e\_hostname() function (CVE-2007-5839).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to connect to a malicious IRC
server, resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application. A local attacker could
perform symlink attacks to overwrite arbitrary files on the local
machine.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Since BitchX is no longer maintained, we recommend that users unmerge
the vulnerable package and switch to another IRC client:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "net-irc/bitchx"
```

Security issues and bugs have been reported, but upstream work seems to have stalled leaving bitchx in a state where there are known problems without official (or in some cases any) fixes.  The most secure course of action is to remove bitchx from the system and switch to using a supported IRC client.  We have not compiled a complete list of open issues in BitchX, but here are a few that we know about:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3360   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4584   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5839   Package removal instructions: +---------------------------+  Remove the package as root: # removepkg bitchx  Some admins may also want to add a symlink to another console IRC client such as irssi to help users migrate:  cd /usr/bin ln -sf irssi BitchX   +-----+  Slackware Linux Security Team http://slackware.com/gpg-key security@slackware.com  +------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | To leave the slackware-security mailing list:                          | +------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Send an email to majordomo@slackware.com with this text in the body of | | the email message:                                                     | |                                                                        | |   unsubscribe slackware-security                                       | |                                                                        | | You will get a confirmation message back containing instructions to    | | complete the process.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
