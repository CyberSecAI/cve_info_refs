# Doomsday: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200802-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Doomsday might allow remote execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **games-fps/doomsday** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.9.0\_beta52** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

The Doomsday Engine (deng) is a modern gaming engine for popular ID
games like Doom, Heretic and Hexen.

### Description

Luigi Auriemma discovered multiple buffer overflows in the
D\_NetPlayerEvent() function, the Msg\_Write() function and the
NetSv\_ReadCommands() function. He also discovered errors when handling
chat messages that are not NULL-terminated (CVE-2007-4642) or contain a
short data length, triggering an integer underflow (CVE-2007-4643).
Furthermore a format string vulnerability was discovered in the
Cl\_GetPackets() function when processing PSV\_CONSOLE\_TEXT messages
(CVE-2007-4644).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the Doomsday server
or cause a Denial of Service by sending specially crafted messages to
the server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

While some of these issues could be resolved in
"games-fps/doomsday-1.9.0-beta5.2", the format string vulnerability
(CVE-2007-4644) remains unfixed. We recommend that users unmerge
Doomsday:

```
 # emerge --unmerge games-fps/doomsday
```

| [Description](#c0)  Matt Fleming (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-08-31 00:25:12 UTC  ``` Luigi Auriemma has reported some vulnerabilities in Doomsday, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or potentially compromise a vulnerable system.  1) A boundary error exists within the "D_NetPlayerEvent()" function in d_net.c when processing chat messages. This can be exploited to overflow a global buffer by sending an overly long chat message to the affected server.  Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code on the game server and the connected clients.  2) A boundary error exists within the "Msg_Write()" function in net_msg.c when processing chat messages. This can be exploited to overflow a global buffer by sending an overly long chat message to the affected server.  3) An integer underflow error exists within the "Sv_HandlePacket()" in sv_main.c when processing chat messages. This can be exploited to trigger a failure to allocate required memory, which leads to a DoS.  4) A boundary error exists within the "NetSv_ReadCommands()" function in d_netsv.c when processing client commands. This can be exploited to overflow a static buffer by sending more than 30 commands to the affected server.  5) A format string error exists within the "Cl_GetPackets()" function when processing "PSV_CONSOLE_TEXT" messages sent by the server. This can potentially be exploited by a malicious server to execute arbitrary code on the affected clients by sending a specially crafted messages.  NOTE: An error in the processing of chat messages may leave a string without a NULL character at the end. This may trigger other vulnerabilities.  The vulnerabilities are reported in version 1.9.0-beta5.1 and prior. Other versions may also be affected. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Matt Fleming (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-08-31 00:27:04 UTC  ``` CC'ing herd and setting whiteboard status. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Mr. Bones.

Bones, what do you think about stabling > 5.2?  I suggest to *NOT* mark as stable this version, because it still contains several bugs, one of which has been reported in this [1] Gentoo Forums topic; see also the linked Doomsday bug report [2] (and IMHO this bug is quite annoying)  I've also the bad sensation that the future of the development of this engine wouldn't be so shiny...

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
