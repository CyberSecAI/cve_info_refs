Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-4644:

**Root Cause:**
*   A format string vulnerability exists in the `Cl_GetPackets()` function within the Doomsday Engine.

**Vulnerability:**
*   The `Cl_GetPackets()` function improperly handles `PSV_CONSOLE_TEXT` messages sent by the server. This function uses format string specifiers without sanitizing user-controlled input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A malicious server could exploit this vulnerability to potentially execute arbitrary code on the affected clients. It is noted that a DoS is also possible.

**Attack Vector:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious server sending specially crafted `PSV_CONSOLE_TEXT` messages to a client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to control a Doomsday game server.
*   The attacker can then send crafted packets to connected clients.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects versions of Doomsday Engine prior to the fix. Specifically, version 1.9.0-beta5.2 was found to be still vulnerable to CVE-2007-4644.
*   While arbitrary code execution is possible, one developer noted that they could only trigger a DoS with this specific vulnerability.
