Original Release Date: 2007-11-14 | Last Revised: 2007-11-15

### Overview

Apple Mac OS X CoreText contains an uninitialized pointer vulnerability, which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Apple Mac OS X CoreText is a framework for handling text on Mac OS X Tiger (10.4) and later. Mac OS X CoreText fails to properly initialize pointers, which can cause memory corruption. Any application that uses the CoreText framework for handling text may be vulnerable. |

### Impact
