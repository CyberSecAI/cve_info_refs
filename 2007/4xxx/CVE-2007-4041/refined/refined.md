  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2007-4041",
    "description": "Mozilla Firefox does not filter input when sending certain URIs to registered protocol handlers. This may allow a remote, authenticated attacker to use Firefox as a vector for executing commands on a vulnerable system.",
    "root_cause": "Mozilla Firefox does not filter data passed to certain URI protocol handlers, relying on the operating system to handle them. This allows specially crafted URIs containing null bytes (`%00`) or other invalid encodings to be interpreted by the OS as file paths instead of URLs when certain conditions are met, leading to the execution of arbitrary commands.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of URIs",
      "Reliance on the OS to handle URLs",
      "Incorrect handling of URI protocols",
      "Insufficient sanitization of special characters in URIs"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary commands, using Firefox as an attack vector.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can craft a malicious URI and trick a user into clicking it, triggering the vulnerability. This could be through a link in an email, a malicious website or other vectors.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create or modify URI strings, and convince a victim to use them via Firefox.",
	"additional_information": "The vulnerability is specific to Windows versions of Firefox, and public exploit code exists for `mailto`, `news`, `nntp`, `snews`, and `telnet` URI handlers."
