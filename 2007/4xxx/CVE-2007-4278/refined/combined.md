## ArcSDE 9.2 Service Pack 3 contains a number of new fixes as well as all the previous fixes released in Service Pack 1 and 2

* **[New issues addressed with Service Pack 3](#sp3)**
* **[Issues previously addressed with Service Pack 2, and included in Service Pack 3](#sp2)**
* **[Issues previously addressed with Service Pack 1, and included in Service Pack 3](#sp1)**

## New issues addressed with Service Pack 3

### SQL Server Specific

+ NIM007077 - sdesetup -o upgrade does not use DBTUNE storage parameters for SQL Server file groups correctly.
+ NIM008325 - sdelayer -o si\_stats does not return information (or correct information) when run against SQL Server databases.
+ NIM009399 - Beginning with ArcGISÂ® 9.2, SQL Server geodatabase identifiers, such as feature class or table names, cannot be case sensitive. This means the contents of the ArcSDEÂ® and geodatabase repository tables (SDE\_ and GDB\_ tables) cannot be created and stored using a case-sensitive collation. Your database collation must be case insensitive, however individual character data columns can store case-sensitive data. This patch will assist users in converting existing 8.3, 9.0 or 9.1 SQL Server geodatabases with a case-sensitive database collation to a 9.2 geodatabase using a case-insensitive collation. After applying the patch users will be able to enable case-sensitive collations on individual character data columns.

### DB2 and Informix Specific

+ NIM007362 - When data is updated in a child replica using geodatabase replication, those features or records are not synchronized to the parent replica. Features that were inserted or deleted, however, are synchronized properly.
+ NIM009097 - DB2 only - When saving edits to a Move to Base Feature class as a privileged non-owner, a "Version could not be posted" error may occur.

### Oracle ST\_Geometry

+ NIM005992 - SDO\_GEOMETRY or Spatial Type for Oracle - When zooming in on event layers in ArcMap, all the features of the event layer disappear.
+ NIM008635 - Not all features in a large (> 1000) selection set move in a single edit operation. Fails with this error: db\_sda\_execute\_stmt::Invalid OCI handle (-2).
+ NIM009208 - Extent calculation may be incorrect when (1) imported from feature class with nil (empty) geometries, or (2) extent is recalculated with "sdelayer -o alter -E calc" and feature class contains nil (empty) geometries .
+ NIM010346 - Tru64 only - Some SQL functions fail with error: symbol "SgShapeFree" unresolved.
+ NIM010347 - Using SQL to insert points into an ST\_POINT geometry type may round the minimum-bounding rectangle values in the geometry's metadata.
+ NIM010348 - AIX and Tru64 only - Creating a pSelectionSet in ArcObjects can cause an "Out of server memory" error (-12) when the query filter WHERE clause is blank or null.

### Oracle General

+ NIM007138 - XML document won't publish with long content in a tag that is indexed as STRING.
+ NIM008343 - Editors may encounter a unique constraint violation when reconciling edits made to data that has been registered as versioned with the option to move edits to base.
+ NIM008806 - Improve connection time to ArcSDE geodatabases containing a large number of tables by restricting the tables returned based on the connecting userâs privileges to the tables. Note: If the connecting user owns a large number of tables, an improvement in connection times may not be experienced.
+ NIM010282 - Not all features in a large (> 1000) selection set move in a single edit operation. Fails with this error: db\_sda\_execute\_stmt::Invalid OCI handle (-2).

### Administration

+ NIM007546 - Receive error message, âFailed to connect to the specified server. Server machine not found.â when attempting to use a server alias that is 32 characters in length or greater in the ArcCatalog 9.2 Spatial Database Connection Properties dialog box. The fix allows the use of up to 32 characters in the server name.
+ NIM008481 -Editors receive the error message, âFeature could not be created, the geometry is invalidâ when trying to edit data that meets the following criteria:
  - Data, such as a shapefile or ArcSDE export file, was originally created in a previous version of ArcGIS (9.1 or earlier).
  - Data is loaded into the ArcSDE geodatabase using the ArcSDE administration command tools (for example, shp2sde or sdeimport).
  - Data is subsequently registered with the geodatabase.
+ NIM010392 - ArcSDEâs giomgr process in a 3 tier configuration can crash if an excessively large numeric value is written to the TCP port. This causes a buffer overflow and stops the process from running. This is an obscure/rare condition.

### NON Database specific Server fixes

+ NIM007048 - Memory allocation has been optimized so that the gsrvr process does not consume or hold as much memory as it did in previous releases.
+ NIM007607 - sde2shp fails with error "Invalid state ID value" when using -V option.
+ NIM008157 - Unable to connect to ArcSDE through ArcCatalog after the spatial references on existing data are upgraded to high precision.
+ NIM008315 - SDE servers on UNIX operating systems - Users who have permissions to access more than 5000 tables or feature classes in the geodatabase cannot connect to the ArcSDE geodatabase through ArcGIS.
+ NIM008390 - With ArcIMS' Metadata Server - XML documents will not be published and an error message will be returned if a user attempts to publish an XML document if the value stored in tags that are indexed as VARCHAR exceeds 256 characters. (Previous behavior allowed the document to be published without error, but the indexed VARCHAR information was truncated to 256 characters.)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
