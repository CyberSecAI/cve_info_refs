{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist within the Vorbis General Audio Compression Codec library (libvorbis), primarily due to improper handling of malformed Ogg audio files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow in the `_01inverse()` function in `res0.c`",
      "Boundary checking error in the `vorbis_info_clear()` function in `info.c`",
      "Potential infinite loop due to issues with seek operations.",
       "Memory corruption issues during stream processing.",
      "Invalid memory access with unknown impact",
       "Heap read/write issues",
       "Static array read issues",
       "Check-before-free error fixes"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation could lead to denial of service (DoS) through crashes or excessive CPU consumption, and potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user processing the malformed audio file.",
    "attack_vectors": "Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by tricking users into opening specially crafted Ogg Vorbis files or network streams with applications linked against libvorbis.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious Ogg Vorbis audio file and entice a user to open it with a vulnerable application."
