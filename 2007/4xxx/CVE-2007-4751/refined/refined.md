Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4751:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A design flaw exists in RemoteDocs R-Viewer where it executes files based solely on the file extension within a specially crafted RDZ archive. This allows for the execution of arbitrary code.
*   The application fails to properly remove temporary files from disk, exposing unencrypted document copies in predictable temporary directories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The application executes the first file within an archive based on its extension, allowing an attacker to execute malicious code.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Temporary directories containing unencrypted copies of previously opened documents are not properly purged.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the R-Viewer application, potentially leading to system compromise.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker could access sensitive document data that was previously opened by the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A specially crafted RDZ archive containing an executable file is opened by a user.
*   An attacker could gain access to a user's machine and extract sensitive information from the predictable temporary file paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious RDZ archive containing an executable.
*   The attacker needs to convince a user to open this malicious RDZ file.
*   For the information disclosure vulnerability, the attacker needs to have access to the file system where the vulnerable application stores temporary files.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in RemoteDocs R-Viewer version 1.6.2836.
*   The issue was fixed in version 1.6.3768.
*   There were no known publicly available exploits at the time of the advisory release.

**CVE-2007-4750** is also mentioned, which relates to the code execution vulnerability. CVE-2007-4751 relates to the sensitive information disclosure vulnerability through temporary file exposure.
