| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=253553#c0)  Lubomir Kundrak    2007-08-20 15:30:09 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  233     String filename = tag.GetFileName(); 234     String sTmpSuffix = ".XXXXXX"; ... 242     strcpy(sTempFile, filename.c_str()); 243     strcat(sTempFile, sTmpSuffix.c_str()); 244  245 #if ((defined(__GNUC__) && __GNUC__ >= 3  ) || !defined(HAVE_MKSTEMP)) 246     // This section is for Windows folk && gcc 3.x folk 247     fstream tmpOut; 248     createFile(sTempFile, tmpOut);  When compiled with gcc 3 or higher, file with a predictable name is created. This can possibly be explited to conduct a symlink attack and either leak information or overwrite arbitrary file on behalf of user using the library (though I a have not had a look at createFile(), maybe the only problem is two programs using the temporary file concurently).  Additional info:  The CVE identifier for this issue had been requested. See URL for debian bug.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=253553#c1)  Lubomir Kundrak    2007-08-21 21:11:54 UTC  ``` Mitre assigned [CVE-2007-4460](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-4460) identifier to this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=253553#c2)  Fedora Update System    2007-08-24 05:40:59 UTC  ``` id3lib-3.8.3-17.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Date: Fri, 17 Aug 2007 18:51:24 +0200
```
Package: libid3-3.8.3c2a
Version: 3.8.3-6
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Hi,

when tagging file $foo, a temporary copy of the file is created, and for some
reason, libid3 doesn't use mkstemp but just creates $foo.XXXXXX literally,
without any checking.
This would silently truncate and overwrite an existing $foo.XXXXXX.

,----[ src/tag_file.cpp ]
| 233     String filename = tag.GetFileName();
| 234     String sTmpSuffix = ".XXXXXX";
| 235     if (filename.size() + sTmpSuffix.size() > ID3_PATH_LENGTH)
| 236     {
| 237       // log this
| 238       return 0;
| 239       //ID3_THROW_DESC(ID3E_NoFile, "filename too long");
| 240     }
| 241     char sTempFile[ID3_PATH_LENGTH];
| 242     strcpy(sTempFile, filename.c_str());
| 243     strcat(sTempFile, sTmpSuffix.c_str());
| 244
| 245 #if ((defined(__GNUC__) && __GNUC__ >= 3  ) || !defined(HAVE_MKSTEMP))
| 246     // This section is for Windows folk && gcc 3.x folk
| 247     fstream tmpOut;
| 248     createFile(sTempFile, tmpOut);

Please use [CVE-2007-3912](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3912) for this.

Robert, please mention this id in the changelog when you upload a
new package (i.e. edit the current changelog entry when you're doing
another upload anyway).

Regards,

	Joey

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 1365-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                         Moritz Muehlenhoff
September 1st, 2007                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : id3lib3.8.3
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem-Type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-4460
Debian Bug     : 438540

Nikolaus Schulz discovered that a programming error in id3lib, an ID3 Tag
Library, may lead to denial of service through symlink attacks.

For the oldstable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.3-4.1sarge1.

Due to a technical limitation in the archive management scripts the fix
for the stable distribution (etch) can only be released in a few days.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.3-7.

We recommend that you upgrade your id3lib3.8.3 packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
