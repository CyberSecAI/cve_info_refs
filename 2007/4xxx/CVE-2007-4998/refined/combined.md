| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=356471#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2007-10-29 14:16:02 UTC  ``` Jim Meyering found:  Assuming an attacker can induce a victim user to copy files created by the attacker, most versions of cp can be abused in such a way that cp unexpectedly overwrites or creates an arbitrary, attacker-chosen file using data provided by the attacker. Of course, the target file must be writable by the user running cp.   No release of GNU cp has been vulnerable since fileutils-4.1.2 (released in Nov 2001).  The first trick is to arrange to copy two files with the same basename to a single destination:  rm -rf a b c; mkdir a b c && > a/1 && > b/1 && cp a/1 b/1 c  But by itself, that doesn't accomplish anything notable.  However, when symlinks are preserved (add -R -P for Solaris, just -R for HP/UX and *BSD), the first file copied is a symlink (pointing to the target file) and a later file (same basename and same dest dir) contains the desired payload, and it's copied through the symlink that has just been created in the destination directory, you've accomplished the exploit.  Here are actual examples: [Note: in the first example, I demonstrate the exploit by writing to the file named "target" in the current directory, but it could just as easily have been /etc/passwd (assuming root is the victim). The Solaris example demonstrates how to overwrite an existing file, $HOME/target. ]  NetBSD 1.6: (note the order of arguments to cp, since the 2nd is copied before the first)  netbsd$ rm -rf a b c; mkdir a b c && echo payload > b/1 && \ ln -s target a/1 && /bin/cp -R b/1 a/1 c; cat c/target payload  FreeBSD 5.0 and 6.1 work the same as above OpenBSD 3.9 is vulnerable in the same way.  Solaris 5.10: (note: contrary to above, a/1 can't be a dangling symlink, and here, the arguments are processed in the expected order)  solaris$ rm -rf a b c; mkdir a b c && echo payload > b/1 \ && ln -s $HOME/target a/1 && > a/1 && /bin/cp -RP a/1 b/1 c solaris$ cat $HOME/target payload  HP/UX 10.20, 11.11, 11.23, 11.31: vulnerable via "/bin/cp -R", with behavior just like that seen on Solaris.  In the above examples, it's easy to see that there's a risk of funny business, because of the explicit source file names. But imagine that some user requests of root to copy all files from two of his/her directories to some other directory -- and supplies this command  cp -R a/* b/* /some/acceptable/looking/dest/dir  Then, the offending symlink and payload files may be obscured by hundreds of other files. And a naive victim, seeing that the user in question owns both source directories, and that the destination directory is inoffensive, might just run the command. Thus writing e.g., any or all of /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /root/.profile, etc.  Currently embargoed   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=356471#c4)  Josh Bressers    2008-01-22 19:10:30 UTC  ``` Given the age of this flaw, along with the low severity, I am opening this bug up to the public.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=356471#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2008-02-01 15:31:57 UTC  ``` Summary of affected versions of cp shipped in fileutils, coreutils and busybox packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora:  - fileutils (RHEL2.1 only) - is affected by this problem, but this issue can   only be used to overwrite existing files, not to create new files  - coreutils   - RHEL3 - similar to cp version shipped in fileutils package in RHEL2.1, can     only by used to overwrite existing files;  additionally, warning is printed     when file is overwritten   - RHEL4, RHEL5, Fedora - not affected  - busybox   - RHEL2.1, RHEL3 - affected, cp can be tricked to overwrite existing files or     create new files   - RHEL4, RHEL5, F7 - affected, only overwrite of already existing file is     possible   - F8 - not affected    ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=356471#c6)  Josh Bressers    2008-02-12 18:50:18 UTC  ``` Due to the very low severity of this flaw, and the fact that fixing it changes how cp works, we don't plan to fix the affected versions.  This flaw is fixed in all packages that ship a cp utility from Fedora 8 onward.   ``` |  |
