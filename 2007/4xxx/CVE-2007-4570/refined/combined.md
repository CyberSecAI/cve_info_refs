| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=288201#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2007-09-12 18:47:19 UTC  ``` Reported via secalert:          There is an algorithmic complexity weakness in the way the MCS translation daemon handles ranges of compartments in sensitivity labels. When translating a security context that includes a range of categories separated by a period, e.g. "c0.c10", the daemon calls the substitute_range() function to replace the range with an explicit declaration of each category, e.g. "c0,c1,c2,c3,c4,c5,c6,c7,c8,c9,10". The vulnerable logic in this function is shown below (with some lines wrapped for readability):          while (tok) {                 if ((r=strchr(tok, '.')) !=0) {                         int begin=atoi(&tok[1]);                         ++r;                         int end=atoi(&r[1]);                         for (;begin<end+1;begin++) {                                 tmp=sub;                                 if (asprintf(&sub, "%sc%d,", sub, begin)                              < 0) {                                         error=1;                                         break;                                 }                                 free(tmp);                         }                 } else {                         tmp=sub;                         if (asprintf(&sub, "%s%s,", sub, tok) < 0) {                                 error=1;                                 break;                         }                         free(tmp);                 }                 tok=strtok_r(NULL, ",", &ptr);         }  The attacker supplies the input string for this function, and the values of 'begin' and 'end' are not checked. Consequently, by supplying an abnormally long range, an attacker can cause the program to remain in the above loop for an extremely long period of time. Since mcstransd is a single-threaded, single-process daemon, it supports only one concurrent request.          This weakness allows a local attacker to trivially prevent the daemon from responding to requests for an extended period of time (hours or days). When the mcstrans service is enabled, the system calls upon mcstransd for user logins and the execution of many programs. If mcstransd does not respond, those operations silently hang.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=288201#c1)  Steve Grubb    2007-09-12 20:13:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 193951](attachment.cgi?id=193951&action=diff "patch attempting to fix problem") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=193951&action=edit "patch attempting to fix problem") patch attempting to fix problem  This is a proposed patch to sanity check the values before using them.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=288201#c7)  Mark J.

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=288201#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2007-09-12 18:47:19 UTC  ``` Reported via secalert:          There is an algorithmic complexity weakness in the way the MCS translation daemon handles ranges of compartments in sensitivity labels. When translating a security context that includes a range of categories separated by a period, e.g. "c0.c10", the daemon calls the substitute_range() function to replace the range with an explicit declaration of each category, e.g. "c0,c1,c2,c3,c4,c5,c6,c7,c8,c9,10". The vulnerable logic in this function is shown below (with some lines wrapped for readability):          while (tok) {                 if ((r=strchr(tok, '.')) !=0) {                         int begin=atoi(&tok[1]);                         ++r;                         int end=atoi(&r[1]);                         for (;begin<end+1;begin++) {                                 tmp=sub;                                 if (asprintf(&sub, "%sc%d,", sub, begin)                              < 0) {                                         error=1;                                         break;                                 }                                 free(tmp);                         }                 } else {                         tmp=sub;                         if (asprintf(&sub, "%s%s,", sub, tok) < 0) {                                 error=1;                                 break;                         }                         free(tmp);                 }                 tok=strtok_r(NULL, ",", &ptr);         }  The attacker supplies the input string for this function, and the values of 'begin' and 'end' are not checked. Consequently, by supplying an abnormally long range, an attacker can cause the program to remain in the above loop for an extremely long period of time. Since mcstransd is a single-threaded, single-process daemon, it supports only one concurrent request.          This weakness allows a local attacker to trivially prevent the daemon from responding to requests for an extended period of time (hours or days). When the mcstrans service is enabled, the system calls upon mcstransd for user logins and the execution of many programs. If mcstransd does not respond, those operations silently hang.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=288201#c1)  Steve Grubb    2007-09-12 20:13:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 193951](attachment.cgi?id=193951&action=diff "patch attempting to fix problem") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=193951&action=edit "patch attempting to fix problem") patch attempting to fix problem  This is a proposed patch to sanity check the values before using them.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=288201#c7)  Mark J.

## Synopsis

Low: mcstrans security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0542)

## Topic

An updated mcstrans package that fixes a security issue and a bug is now
available.

This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

mcstrans is the translation daemon used on SELinux machines to translate
program context into human readable form.

An algorithmic complexity weakness was found in the way the mcstrans daemon
handled ranges of compartments in sensitivity labels. A local user could
trigger this flaw causing mctransd to temporarily stop responding to other
requests; a partial denial of service. (CVE-2007-4570)

This update also fixes a problem where the mcstrans daemon was preventing
SSH connections into an SELinux box, that was running a Multi-Level
Security (MLS) Policy with multiple categories.

Users of mcstrans are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
resolves this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_58_10188>
