  "cve_id": "CVE-2007-4279",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application uses a user-supplied parameter (`path_to_root`) in include statements, allowing for arbitrary file inclusion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary remote files and execute code on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, depending on the attacker's payload.",
    "attack_vectors": "By manipulating the `path_to_root` parameter in HTTP GET requests, an attacker can specify a malicious file to be included.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server and have access to a malicious file to include (either locally or remotely). No prior authentication is required."
