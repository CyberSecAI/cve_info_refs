Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input sanitization for the `$id` variable in several PHP files (`hal.php`, `cetak.php`, `lihat.php`, `pesan.php`, and `teman.php`) of AuraCMS version 1.5rc. This allows for direct injection of SQL commands through the URL parameters.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection due to the direct use of unsanitized input in SQL queries. This lack of input validation allows attackers to manipulate the SQL queries.
    *   The application does not filter user-supplied input before using it in database queries.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords, as shown in the examples provided.
    *   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection can potentially lead to more serious attacks, such as modifying or deleting data, or even gaining control over the database server.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL of the vulnerable scripts.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, as the vulnerabilities are accessible via HTTP requests through a web browser.
    *   **Basic knowledge of SQL:**  The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft injection payloads.

**Vulnerable Files & Parameters:**

*   `hal.php`: `id` parameter
*   `cetak.php`: `id` parameter
*   `lihat.php`: `id` parameter
*   `pesan.php`: `id` parameter
*   `teman.php`: `id` parameter
