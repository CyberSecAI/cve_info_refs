  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `root` parameter of the `pixlie.php` script. This allows for directory traversal.",

      "Path Traversal",
      "Remote File Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files, application source code, or user data.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by sending an HTTP GET request to the `pixlie.php` script with a crafted `root` parameter containing directory traversal sequences.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. No authentication or special privileges are required."
