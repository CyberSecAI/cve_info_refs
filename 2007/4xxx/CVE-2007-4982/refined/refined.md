```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The MW6 Technologies QRCode ActiveX control contains two methods, "SaveAsBMP()" and "SaveAsWMF()", which write to a file specified as an argument. These methods do not properly validate the file path argument.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unvalidated file path leading to arbitrary file overwrite vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system in the context of the currently logged-on user, potentially leading to system compromise or denial of service.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a malicious website or HTML document by using the ActiveX control.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into visiting a malicious webpage which includes the vulnerable activeX control, or send a malicious HTML document via email or other means to an end-user which includes the vulnerable activeX control.
