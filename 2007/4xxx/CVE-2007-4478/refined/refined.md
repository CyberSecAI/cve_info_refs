Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from Internet Explorer's behavior when saving a webpage with a specially crafted URL. The browser saves the URL containing XSS code directly into the saved HTML file. When the saved HTML file is opened, the XSS code executes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. The malicious script is embedded in the saved HTML page, allowing it to be executed when the page is opened in a browser.
- **Improper URL handling:** IE incorrectly saves the malicious URL including script tags into the saved HTML file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user viewing the saved HTML page.
- **Potential File System Access:** The content mentions that such XSS can be used to gain access to the local file system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** An attacker crafts a URL containing XSS code, which, when accessed and saved via IE, creates an infected HTML file.
- **Saved HTML file:** The infected HTML file acts as the persistent vector. If a user opens it in any browser (as the article states, though IE was the saving vector), the XSS code will execute.
- **Web server hosting:** The infected HTML file can also be uploaded to a web server, and when visited by other users the XSS code executes.
- **Iframe injection:** The attacker can embed the crafted URL in an iframe for a hidden attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a URL containing XSS code.
- The victim needs to use Internet Explorer to save a webpage accessed with the crafted malicious URL.
- The attacker needs a way to have the victim open the saved HTML file, either by tricking the user or hosting it on a website.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was confirmed to be present in Internet Explorer 6 and 7.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Internet Explorer 8.
- The vulnerability can be exploited through a URL or an iframe.
- The vulnerability is a type of "Post Persistent XSS (Saved XSS)", a subclass of Persistent XSS.
- The saved HTML file executes XSS code in any browser when opened.
