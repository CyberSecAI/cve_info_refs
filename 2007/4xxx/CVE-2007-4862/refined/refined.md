Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2007-4862:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in SAXON version 5.4, an online news publishing system.
*   The vulnerability arises due to the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling the `news_url` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Content Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts to force a website to display unwanted content.
*   **Client-Side Attacks:** The injected JavaScript executes in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Potential for Stealing Cookies:** The provided example demonstrates how an attacker could steal cookies.
*   **Integrity Impact:** Attackers can modify content.
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information via the user's session.
*   **Availability Impact:** Although not the main impact, attackers may be able to disrupt the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network (Remote):** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP GET request to `menu.php`, specifically manipulating the `config[news_url]` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the target server.
*   **Knowledge of Target URL:** The attacker needs to know the URL of the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Specific Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `config[news_url]`.
*   **PHP Configuration:** The vulnerability is more easily exploited when PHP's `register_globals` is set to "On" and `magic_quotes_gpc` is set to "Off".
*   **Vendor Solution:** The vendor, Quirm, released version 5.41, which addresses the vulnerability.
*   **Workarounds:** Setting `register_globals` to "Off" in `php.ini`, or using a `.htaccess` file to set `php_flag register_globals off` will mitigate the issue.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).

**Example of Attack:**

The provided example shows a request to `menu.php` with a crafted `config[news_url]` parameter to inject JavaScript:

`http://[TARGET]/[PRODUCT DIRECTORY]/admin/menu.php?config[news_url]="><script>alert(document.cookies)</script>`

The server would then execute the injected `<script>` code, allowing the attacker to, in this case, alert the user's cookies.
