Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw in the `fc_example.php` file of FishCart 3.2 RC2. The vulnerability stems from the use of an unsanitized variable `$docroot` in a `require` statement.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `fc_example.php` file includes a file using the `require` function, but the path to the included file is constructed using a variable (`$docroot`) which an attacker can control via the GET parameter. This allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote server.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The script does not sanitize or validate the `$docroot` parameter, making it possible to inject malicious URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the vulnerable server by including a malicious file from a remote location, potentially leading to complete compromise of the server.
- **Data Theft:** The attacker can gain access to sensitive information on the server, such as database credentials.
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker can modify the website's content, redirect traffic or disable the site.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker can use the compromised server to host and distribute malware.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted GET request to the vulnerable script `fc_example.php`, manipulating the `docroot` parameter to include a malicious file from a remote location.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the vulnerable server over the network (usually HTTP/HTTPS).
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable script (`fc_example.php`) and the vulnerable parameter `docroot`
