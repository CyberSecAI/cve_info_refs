  "cve_id": "CVE-2007-4983",
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_2fc8dac5_20250124_141022.html",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies within the `DownloadFromMusicStore()` ActiveX control function in jetAudio 7.x.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "The `DownloadFromMusicStore()` function allows a remote attacker to specify the download URL and the destination path of the downloaded file, allowing arbitrary file downloads.",
           "The function does not properly validate the destination path allowing for directory traversal using `..\\` sequences, which allows the attacker to write the downloaded file to an arbitrary location on the file system."
        ],
        "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker can download a malicious executable (renamed to a .mp3), use directory traversal to place it in the jetAudio install directory (where it can execute), and execute it.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "The vulnerability is triggered via a malicious HTML page.",
           "The HTML page uses the vulnerable `DownloadFromMusicStore()` ActiveX control.",
           "The attacker hosts the malicious executable on a web server."
        ],
        "required_capabilities": [
          "The attacker needs to host a malicious executable accessible via HTTP.",
          "The victim must visit a malicious web page using a browser that supports ActiveX and has the vulnerable jetAudio ActiveX component installed."
