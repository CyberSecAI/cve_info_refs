Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a blind SQL injection flaw in the `viewitem.php` script of DL PayCart 1.01. The script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `ItemID` parameter, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker does not receive direct output from the database query. Instead, they infer results based on the application's response (in this case, the presence or absence of the "noimage.gif" string in the response) to different injected queries.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize the `ItemID` parameter in the `viewitem.php` script, allowing attackers to inject SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Extraction:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as admin credentials (AdminID and AdminPass, specifically targeted in the exploit script), by crafting SQL queries that reveal character by character.
- **Potentially Further Compromise:** With extracted admin credentials, attackers could potentially gain full control of the application, leading to further attacks, data breaches or complete server compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `viewitem.php` with a malicious `ItemID` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax and be able to construct queries that extract information through blind SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**
The provided Perl script demonstrates the exploit:

1.  It iterates through the possible characters of the AdminID and AdminPass fields in the `pc_settings` table.
2.  For each character position, it tries different character values (ASCII 32-255) using a `while` loop.
3.  It constructs a blind SQL injection query using `substring` and `char` functions. The injected query is designed to check if a specific character is at a specific position within the admin credentials fields.
4.  If the response to the query does not contain "noimage.gif", it infers that the character is correct and prints it to stdout.

The exploit makes use of `substring((select AdminID from pc_settings limit 0,1), position,1)=char(character)` to extract each character.
