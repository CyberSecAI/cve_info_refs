**CVE-2007-4485** relates to a Remote File Include (RFI) vulnerability found in **Butterfly online visitors counter version 1.08**.

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to include remote files.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**: The primary vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI). This type of vulnerability occurs when an application allows the inclusion of remote files through user-controlled parameters.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to include malicious code from a remote server, potentially leading to:
    *   Arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   Website defacement.
    *   Data theft or manipulation.
    *   Compromise of the server and potentially the entire network
*   **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is through the application's web interface. An attacker would likely manipulate a parameter that is used to include files. This can be done through a web browser or custom script.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, meaning the application must be accessible over a network. They also need to be able to control or influence the path parameter used to include remote files.
