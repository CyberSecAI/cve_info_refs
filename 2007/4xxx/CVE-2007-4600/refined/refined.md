{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The 'Protect Worksheet' functionality in Mathcad versions 12 through 14 uses a flawed implementation of file format for saving files. Specifically, the XMCDZ file format is just a gzipped XML file. The password used for protection is also hashed, however the same hash is always produced for a given string.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The XMCDZ file format is a gzipped XML file which can be easily extracted using archive utilities.",
      "The password hash used for protection is predictable and consistent for a given string.",
        "The protection level in the XML file is stored in plain text and can be changed with a text editor",
      "The application does not detect external changes to the XML file."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the 'Protect Worksheet' feature, granting unauthorized access to protected data. This includes unauthorized disclosure of information and the possibility of partial confidentiality, integrity, and availability violation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Extract the XML file from the gzipped XMCDZ file using archive utilities.",
       "Modify the <protection> tag within the extracted XML file using a text editor to reduce protection level or remove password protection."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to extract the XML data from the Mathcad file and the ability to edit text files.",
    "additional_details": [
        "The protection level settings include high, medium and low corresponding to Editing, Content, and File protection.",
        "The password hash for a given string is the same in all files and can be reused or removed."
