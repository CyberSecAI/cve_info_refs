```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `article_id` parameter in `index.php`, which is not properly sanitized before being used in a database query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database (in this case, username and password hashes) by injecting malicious SQL queries.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a crafted `article_id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
