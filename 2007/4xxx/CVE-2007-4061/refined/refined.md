      "vulnerability": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way the Nessus Vulnerability Scanner handles ActiveX controls. Specifically, the `addsetConfig` and `saveNessusRC` methods within the ActiveX control can be exploited.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "The ActiveX control allows arbitrary command execution through the `addsetConfig` method.",
          "The `saveNessusRC` method allows an attacker to save a file (potentially malicious) to an arbitrary location on the filesystem."
        ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the target system and write files to arbitrary locations, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
        "attack_vector": "Remote exploitation through a malicious HTML page. The attacker can host this page on a server and entice a user to visit it.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a web page with the malicious code. The victim needs to have the vulnerable Nessus Vulnerability Scanner installed and be using Internet Explorer."
