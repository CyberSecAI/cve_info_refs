  "CVE-2007-4901": {
    "description": "The embedded Internet Explorer server control in AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) 6.1.41.2 and 6.2.32.1, AIM Pro, and AIM Lite does not properly constrain the use of mshtml.dll's web script and HTML functionality for incoming instant messages, which allows remote attackers to place HTML into unexpected contexts or execute arbitrary code, as demonstrated by writing arbitrary HTML to a notification window, and writing contents of arbitrary local image files to this window via IMG SRC.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The embedded Internet Explorer server control within AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) does not properly restrict the use of mshtml.dll's web script and HTML functionalities for incoming instant messages.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper restriction of HTML and web script functionality within the embedded browser control.",
        "Lack of input validation and sanitization for incoming messages."
      ],
       "impact": "Remote attackers can inject arbitrary HTML into notification windows, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and exposure of local files.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending specially crafted instant messages containing HTML and web script.",
		"Abusing the IMG SRC tag to read and display local files."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send instant messages to the victim and does not need authentication. "
