| [Description](#c0)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 18:52:46 UTC  ``` We need to patch the freetype sources to look for the right config.  Should be easy. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-06 23:54:33 UTC  ``` So which is the correct? is it /etc/X11? If so, we just set it to /etc/X11 and make a symlink from /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XftConfig -> /etc/X11/XftConfig (othewise the other way around).  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Geert Bevin    2002-01-08 16:51:05 UTC  ``` I think that working with a symlink is a good solution and /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XftConfig seems to have to be the real file since that is where freetype looks. /etc/X11/XftConfig is just for user convenience ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-12 10:55:11 UTC  ``` From the CHANGELOG:   402. Install the XftConfig file under $(CONFDIR), with a link from the       usual place (based on #4569, Branden Robinson).  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-12 15:55:04 UTC  ``` Meaning that it looks like /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XftConfig -> /etc/X11/XftConfig is the correct solution.  BTW, it is not in the freetype source, but in the Xft source, which is part of X. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-13 23:55:28 UTC  ``` I'm assigning this one to you azarah, hope it's ok.  ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-14 00:05:14 UTC  ``` ok. /etc/X11/XftConfig is still the correct location according to the FHS.  Currently, the xfree ebuild installs a file to /etc/X11/XftConfig, but it is ignored and the other one installed to /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XftConfig is used instead.  Yes, the easy fix is to add a symlink, but I think actually fixing the sources is a better idea. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-23 16:51:22 UTC  ``` Fixed in the 4.2.0 ebuilds ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# 2.20.4, 2.22.2, and 3.0 Security Advisory

Thursday, Aug 23rd, 2007
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* A possible cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when filing bugs
  using the guided form.

* When using email_in.pl, insufficiently escaped data may be passed to
  sendmail.

* Users using the WebService interface may access Bugzilla's time-tracking
  fields even if they normally cannot see them.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.17.1 and above
Description: Bugzilla does not properly escape the 'buildid' field in
             the guided form when filing bugs. From 2.17.1 till 2.23.3,
             this field was based exclusively on the User-Agent string
             returned by your web browser. Since 2.23.4, this parameter
             can be defined in the URL passed to enter_bug.cgi, overwriting
             the User-Agent string and may lead to cross-site scripting.
             The guided form is not usually used by Bugzilla installations,
             as it is shipped only as an example to be modified for their
             own use.

Class:       Command Injection
Affected:    2.23.4 and above
Description: Bugzilla 2.23.4 and newer use the Email:: modules instead
             of the Mail:: and MIME:: ones. The argument passed to the -f
             option of Email::Send::Sendmail() is insufficiently escaped
             and may lead to limited command injection when called from
             email_in.pl, a script which was also introduced in 2.23.4.

Class:       Information Leak
Affected:    2.23.3 and above
Description: Bugzilla's WebService (XML-RPC) interface allows you to access
             the time-tracking fields (such as Deadline, Estimated Time, etc.)
             on all bugs, even if you normally cannot access time-tracking
             fields.

Vulnerability Solutions
=======================

The fix for these issues is included in the
releases. Upgrading to a release with the relevant fix will
protect your installation from possible exploits of these issues.

If you are unable to upgrade but would like to patch just the security
vulnerability, there are patches available for the issues at the
"References" URL.

Full release downloads, patches to upgrade Bugzilla from previous
versions, and git upgrade instructions are available at:

# Bugzilla: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200709-18**

Bugzilla contains several vulnerabilities, some of them possibly leading to
the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/bugzilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.0.1** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **2.20.5**revision >= **2.22.3**>= **3.0.1**revision >= **2.22.5**revision >= **2.20.6** |

### Background

Bugzilla is a web application designed to help with managing software
development.

### Description

Masahiro Yamada found that from the 2.17.1 version, Bugzilla does not
properly sanitize the content of the "buildid" parameter when filing
bugs (CVE-2007-4543). The next two vulnerabilities only affect Bugzilla
2.23.3 or later, hence the stable Gentoo Portage tree does not contain
these two vulnerabilities: Loic Minier reported that the
"Email::Send::Sendmail()" function does not properly sanitise "from"
email information before sending it to the "-f" parameter of
/usr/sbin/sendmail (CVE-2007-4538), and Frederic Buclin discovered that
the XML-RPC interface does not correctly check permissions in the
time-tracking fields (CVE-2007-4539).

### Impact

A remote attacker could trigger the "buildid" vulnerability by sending
a specially crafted form to Bugzilla, leading to a persistent XSS, thus
allowing for theft of credentials. With Bugzilla 2.23.3 or later, an
attacker could also execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the
web server by injecting a specially crafted "from" email address and
gain access to normally restricted time-tracking information through
the XML-RPC service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Bugzilla users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose www-apps/bugzilla
```

useragents are between you, your browser, its extensions, your trusted proxy, and bugzilla.
if your trusted proxy isn't trustworthy it can just insert whatever it pleases whenever it pleases. similarly for everything else up the line.Group: webtools-security

patch, v1
two of you came up with the same patch independently, and it's what I would have done myself, too, so it must be good ;)

patch, v1.1
ah, yes, I was meaning to ask earlier what justification was used for adding it there to begin with (hence why it passed the test anyway)

This is not a security problem; you can't XSS yourself. However, if the build ID were to include a "<" character, then the page would render incorrectly, so it's appropriate to fix it.

No, This is XSS vulnerability!
If URL Parameter "buildid" exists in request, create-guided.html/tmpl uses its value instead of UA string.
Following url causes XSS.
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Thunderbird&format=guided&reproducible=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22XSS%22)%3C/script%3E>
Workaround: NoScript can block this XSS.

OK, now that \_is\_ an XSS :-( The problem here is that the build ID was originally always taken from the UA (no problem) but then someone asked for the possibility of passing it as a URL parameter, and we added that. This introduced the XSS problem and we didn't notice. Drat.
Lesson: we should presume even more in favour of filtering when in doubt.

For the record, buildid was introduced in [bug 133559](/show_bug.cgi?id=133559 "RESOLVED FIXED - Bugzilla Helper should be enter_bug.cgi template") for Bugzilla 2.17.1. At that time, buildid was only taken from the UA. Then [bug 308950](/show_bug.cgi?id=308950 "RESOLVED FIXED - RFE: Add build-id URL parameter to guided enter bug page (for non-browser products)") implemented the ability to pass it as a parameter, which would overwrite the UA. This was for Bugzilla 2.23.4. So if you trust your UA, only 2.23.4 and higher are "really" affected by this bug, but this field has never been escaped, even in 2.17.1.Summary: User Agent text should be HTML escaped → [SECURITY] User Agent text should be HTML escapedVersion: 2.20.4 → 2.17.1
