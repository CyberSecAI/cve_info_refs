```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `SetText()` function of the `nvUnifiedControl.dll` ActiveX control.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The `SetText()` function does not properly validate the size of the input buffer, allowing an attacker to write past the allocated buffer and overwrite heap memory. This is a heap-based buffer overflow. The ActiveX control is also marked as "Not Safe for Scripting", indicating that it is potentially vulnerable to exploits when used in a scripting environment.
- Impact of exploitation: By exploiting the buffer overflow vulnerability, an attacker can overwrite heap memory with attacker-controlled data, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Attack vectors: The attack is performed remotely through a web browser by embedding the vulnerable ActiveX control in a webpage. The attacker uses a heap spray technique to increase the likelihood that the overflow will overwrite a predictable location and execute the shellcode.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage with the embedded ActiveX control and convince a victim to visit the page using a vulnerable browser. The victim needs to have the vulnerable ActiveX control installed.
