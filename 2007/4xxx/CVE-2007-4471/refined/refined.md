```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Intuit QuickBooks Online Edition ActiveX control has dangerous methods (e.g., httpGETToFile(), httpPOSTFromFile()) that do not properly restrict access, allowing for arbitrary file downloads/uploads.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:  Improper access control for methods within the ActiveX control.
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution on a vulnerable system by downloading malicious files. Attackers could also potentially retrieve files from the victim's computer.
- Attack vectors: Convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (web page, HTML email, or email attachment) that leverages the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious HTML content to the victim and the victim must have the vulnerable ActiveX control installed and enabled within their web browser.
