Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in Babo Violent 2, as described by Luigi Auriemma:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **A] Crash through malformed value:**
    *   **Root cause:** Sending specific data packets with IDs 0xca, 0xcb, 0xcc, 0xce, 0xcf, and 0xd0, where the first byte is greater than or equal to a certain threshold (0x28 or similar), causes a crash.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper input validation leading to a crash.
    *  **Impact:** Denial of service.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending malformed data packets to the server.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Network access to the server.

*   **B] Format string:**
    *   **Root cause:** The server uses an output function vulnerable to format string exploits.
    *   **Weakness:** Format string vulnerability in server output function.
    *   **Impact:** Can potentially lead to information disclosure, denial of service or code execution.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending crafted messages containing format string specifiers (e.g., `%x`) through chat or admin login.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to send messages to the server.

*   **C] Crash through nonexistent map:**
    *   **Root cause:** When a client specifies a non-existent map, the server attempts to open it, which leads to an exception and crash.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper file existence checks.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service.
    *   **Attack vector:**  Specifying an invalid map name when connecting to the server.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to specify map names when connecting.

*   **D] Crash through malformed UDP packet:**
    *   **Root cause:** The game uses a separate port (11111) for LAN queries and clients; UDP packets contain a 16-bit size field, and sending a small packet with a large size value causes a buffer overflow.
    *   **Weakness:** Buffer overflow vulnerability in UDP packet handling.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service on both clients and servers.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted UDP packet with a manipulated size field to either client or server.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to send UDP packets to the client or server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability report mentions that the server's password protection is not very robust, making it easier to exploit the in-game bugs on password-protected servers, even without knowing the password.
*   Chat messages can be spoofed since the sender is specified by the client.
*   The author, Luigi Auriemma, also provides a PoC exploit for these vulnerabilities.
