I just downloaded the source code and it's as you described.  Looks wrong
to me, too - $admin_name etc. are hard-coded in config.php, which is
included just before this code.  Not to mention that "administrator" isn't
a valid md5 result :)

I must be losing it... ilker kandemir posted a recent advisory to
SecurityFocus about a way to bypass authentication in BellaBiblio:

   <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/475103/30/0/threaded>

quotes the following code snippet:

   if (isset($_COOKIE['bellabiblio'])) {
   if ($_COOKIE['bellabiblio'] == md5($admin_name.$admin_pass.$secret)) {
   if (isset($_GET['ap'])) $page = $_GET['ap']; else $page = "";

and then says you just need to set the 'bellabiblio' cookie to
'administrator' when calling the admin.php to bypass authentication.
Hello? md5() returns a 32-byte hash, so how in the world can that ever
equal 'administrator'??? So unless I'm having a really bad start to the
week, it looks like Bugtraq 25140 is bogus.
