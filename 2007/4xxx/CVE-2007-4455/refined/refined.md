```
{
  "Root cause": "The SIP channel driver in Asterisk was not limiting the number of history items stored for a given SIP dialog. Regardless of whether recording SIP dialog history was enabled or not, the history was still recorded in memory without an upper limit.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Resource exhaustion",
    "Lack of input validation/limit",
    "Denial of Service"
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by exhausting the system's memory by creating a SIP dialog with many history entries that never ends.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote, unauthenticated sessions via SIP.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to establish SIP dialogs with an Asterisk server."
