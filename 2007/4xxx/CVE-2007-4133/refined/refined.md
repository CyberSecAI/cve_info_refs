- Root cause of vulnerability: A misconversion of hugetlb_vmtruncate_list to prio_tree in hugetlbfs.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Incorrect handling of huge page table lists leading to a kernel panic.
- Impact of exploitation: Local Denial of Service (panic) leading to system crash.
- Attack vectors: Local users mounting a hugetlbfs filesystem.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Local user with the ability to mount file systems.
