        "root_cause": "The `safe_bprintf` function in Alien Arena 2007 uses `cprintf` without a proper format argument, leading to a format string vulnerability.",

For the format string vulnerability, this can be achieved by using a malformed nickname. For the spoofed connection, the attacker needs the server ip and port and target client ip and port which is obtained from the game server"
