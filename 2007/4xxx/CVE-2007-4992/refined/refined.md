- If properly exploited, remote control of the affected system can be attained with SYSTEM credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted, overly long request to the Firebird server on TCP port 3050.
- Remote exploitation, no authentication is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to a Firebird server instance.
- Ability to craft and send malicious network requests to TCP port 3050.
