```

I investigated this because ilker kandemir is the same researcher who
reported the apparently-incorrect BellaBiblio issue.

However, this one is clearly true.

Both index.php and vote.php contain this code in the first line:

  require ($Madoa . "config.php");

admin.php has a preceding require of functions/general.php, but that's
just (surprise) function definitions.
