{
  "CVE-2007-4308": {
    "Description": "The (1) aac_cfg_open and (2) aac_compat_ioctl functions in the SCSI layer ioctl path in aacraid in the Linux kernel did not check permissions for ioctls, which might have allowed local users to cause a denial of service or gain privileges.",
    "Root cause": "Lack of permission checks for ioctls in the aacraid driver.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
       "Inadequate input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users could cause a denial of service or gain privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access via crafted ioctl calls"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access on the system."
  }
