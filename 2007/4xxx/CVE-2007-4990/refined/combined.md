The patch seems fine, that's mostly what it's being done in xfstt.

X.Org security advisory, October 2nd, 2007
Multiple vulnerabilities in X font server
CVE ID: CVE-2007-4568

Overview

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in xfs, the X font
server.  The QueryXBitmaps and QueryXExtents protocol requests suffer
from lack of validation of their 'length' parameters. Maliciously
crafted requests can either cause two different problems with both
requests:

 * An integer overflow in the computation of the size of a dynamic
   buffer can lead to a heap overflow in the build_range() function.

 * An arbitrary number of bytes on the heap can be swapped by the
   swap_char2b() function.

Impact

These vulnerabilities can lead to code execution in the font
server. On most modern systems, the font server is accessible only for
local clients and runs with reduced privileges. But on some systems it
may still be accessible from remote clients and possibly running with
root privileges, creating an opportunity for remote privilege
escalation.

Affected versions

All X.Org released versions of xfs are vulnerable to these
problems. Other implementations of the font server based on the X11R6
sample implementation are likely to be vulnerable too.

Fix

A fix for these vulnerabilities is included in xfs 1.0.5.

A patch for xfs 1.0.4 (included in X11R7.3) that should apply on
former versions with minor tweaks is also available:

ftp://ftp.freedesktop.org/pub/X11R7.3/patches/xorg-xfs-1.0.4-query.diff
MD5: e61a30a8cff105b86f8b924d84508e24	xorg-xfs-1.0.4-query.diff
SHA1: 093db0ce2c134ebc40e47a40db89503dad2b0f3e	xorg-xfs-1.0.4-query.diff

Thanks

These vulnerabilities were discovered by Sean Larsson from iDefense
Labs.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# X Font Server: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **200710-11**

Three vulnerabilities have been discovered in the X Font Server possibly
allowing local attackers to gain elevated privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-apps/xfs** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.5** |

### Background

The X.Org X11 X Font Server provides a standard mechanism for an X
server to communicate with a font renderer.

### Description

iDefense reported that the xfs init script does not correctly handle a
race condition when setting permissions of a temporary file
(CVE-2007-3103). Sean Larsson discovered an integer overflow
vulnerability in the build\_range() function possibly leading to a
heap-based buffer overflow when handling "QueryXBitmaps" and
"QueryXExtents" protocol requests (CVE-2007-4568). Sean Larsson also
discovered an error in the swap\_char2b() function possibly leading to a
heap corruption when handling the same protocol requests
(CVE-2007-4990).

### Impact

The first issue would allow a local attacker to change permissions of
arbitrary files to be world-writable by performing a symlink attack.
The second and third issues would allow a local attacker to execute
arbitrary code with privileges of the user running the X Font Server,
usually xfs.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All X Font Server users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-apps/xfs-1.0.5"
```
