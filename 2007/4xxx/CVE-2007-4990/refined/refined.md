Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4990:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `swap_char2b()` function in the X Font Server (xfs) has a flaw that allows for arbitrary byte swapping on the heap due to a lack of proper validation of the 'length' parameters in the `QueryXBitmaps` and `QueryXExtents` protocol requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap Corruption:** The vulnerability stems from an error in the `swap_char2b()` function, which can lead to heap corruption.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The lack of validation of the 'length' parameters within the `QueryXBitmaps` and `QueryXExtents` requests allows for crafted requests to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the font server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the font server is running with root privileges or is accessible from remote clients, this vulnerability can enable privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** By sending maliciously crafted `QueryXBitmaps` or `QueryXExtents` protocol requests to the X Font Server.
- **Local:** In most modern systems, the font server is accessible only to local clients and runs with reduced privileges. However, if improperly configured, it can still be vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** For remote exploitation, the attacker would need network access to the machine running the X font server and the ability to send crafted network packets.
- **Local Access:** A local user account on the machine hosting the X Font Server is necessary for local exploitation.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Sean Larsson from iDefense Labs.
*   The vulnerability is present in all released versions of xfs from X.Org and potentially other font servers based on X11R6 sample implementation.
*   A patch for xfs 1.0.4 (included in X11R7.3) is available, and a fix was incorporated into xfs 1.0.5.
*   The vulnerability is related to CVE-2007-4568, which involves an integer overflow in the `build_range()` function, also triggered by `QueryXBitmaps` and `QueryXExtents` requests.
*   A reproducer program has been created to demonstrate the vulnerability.

The provided information also indicates that the Gentoo Security Team has released a GLSA (Gentoo Linux Security Advisory) to address this and other related vulnerabilities, urging users to upgrade to xfs-1.0.5.
