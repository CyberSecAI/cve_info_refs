Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-4658:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `money_format()` function in PHP, specifically in how it handles format string tokens like "%i" or "%n". The function was not correctly validating or sanitizing user-supplied data used within these format specifiers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The core issue is that the `money_format()` function doesn't properly validate or restrict the input passed to format specifiers, allowing a format string vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** An attacker could potentially craft malicious input to `money_format()` that may expose sensitive information through uncontrolled format specifier processing.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing specific format strings, an attacker could potentially cause the `money_format()` function to enter an infinite loop or consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely if an attacker can control or influence data passed to the `money_format()` function within a PHP application accessible over a network.
*   The code is specifically exploited by passing multiple `%i` or `%n` tokens into the `money_format()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to influence the data supplied to the `money_format()` function in a vulnerable PHP script. This could be through:
    *   Directly supplying user input to the function.
    *   Influencing data retrieved from a database or external resource, which is then passed to the function.
    *   Exploiting other vulnerabilities (like SQL injection) to inject the malicious data.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided bugzilla content also notes that it is unusual for a PHP script to pass user-supplied data to the `money_format()` function directly. This suggests that the vulnerability is more likely to be present in poorly written or less common PHP code.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in PHP 5.2.4 by preventing `money_format()` from accepting multiple `%i` or `%n` tokens.
*   Multiple Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA-2007:0888, RHSA-2007:0889, RHSA-2007:0890, RHSA-2007:0891, RHSA-2007:0917) address this issue, indicating that it was a widespread problem across various Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200710-02) also highlights this vulnerability and lists it as one of the several fixed in PHP version 5.2.4\_p20070914-r2.
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-549-2) also indicates that this vulnerability affects their 7.10 release.
*  The Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2007:0889) specifically states "A flaw was found in the PHP money\_format function. If a remote attacker was able to pass arbitrary data to the money\_format function this could possibly result in an information leak or denial of service. Note that it is unusual for a PHP script to pass user-supplied data to the money\_format function."

In summary, CVE-2007-4658 is a format string vulnerability in PHP's `money_format()` function, which can be exploited remotely to cause information leaks or denial of service.  The vulnerability is triggered by passing multiple %i or %n tokens in user controlled data to the affected function.
