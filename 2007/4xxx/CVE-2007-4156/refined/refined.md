Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in two files:
    *   `/common.php`: The `id` parameter from the GET request is directly inserted into an SQL query without proper sanitization.
    *   `/admin/index.php`: The `uid` variable, representing the email, is directly inserted into an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The lack of input sanitization allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can use SQL injection to retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials (email and password).
*   **Authentication Bypass:** By manipulating the SQL query in the admin login page, attackers can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain administrative access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious HTTP GET requests with injected SQL code in the `id` parameter of `/member.php` and `uid` parameter of `/admin/index.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know which parameters are vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **`magic_quotes_gpc = off`**: The exploit requires that the `magic_quotes_gpc` setting in PHP is turned off, as it would otherwise escape special characters in the input which will prevent SQL injection attacks.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `wolioCMS`.
*   The SQL injection exists in two files:
    *   `/common.php` on line 73
    *   `/admin/index.php` on line 28.
*   The provided exploit examples demonstrate how to extract user credentials and bypass the admin login.

**Exploit Examples**
*   **SQL Injection:**
    ```
    http://localhost/_woliocms/member.php?member=admin&act=page&id='/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/null,null,concat(member_email,'-',member_password),null,null,null,null,null,null,null/**/FROM/**/member/*
    ```
    This URL is used to extract `member_email` and `member_password` from the `member` table by using the `UNION` SQL injection.

*   **Bypass Administrator Login:**
    *   **Email:**
      ```
      '/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/member_id,member_email,member_password,member_realname,member_urlname,member_themes,member_groups_id,member_register_date,member_active,member_activation_code/**/FROM/**/member/*
      ```
    *   **Password:** Blank
    This payload bypasses the authentication process by injecting a `UNION SELECT` statement into the `member_email` field. It returns all the columns of the member table. It expects the password to be empty.
