{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to improper verification of OPEN messages or COMMUNITY attributes received from configured BGP peers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The bgpd daemon in Quagga does not correctly validate input, leading to a denial-of-service condition."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious, authenticated remote peer can send a specially crafted message that causes the BGP daemon (bgpd) to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This crash is caused by a null pointer dereference when debug logging is enabled.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a network connection from a configured BGP peer.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be a configured BGP peer and must be able to send malformed OPEN messages or COMMUNITY attributes to the vulnerable system. "
