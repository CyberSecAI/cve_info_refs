Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist within the SkyPortal RC6 web application. These vulnerabilities stem from insufficient sanitization or validation of user-supplied input before it's used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Multiple SQL injection points were found across several files:
    *   `nc_top.asp` (line 59)
    *   `inc_bookmarks.asp` (line 179)
    *   `inc_profile_functions.asp` (lines 568, 570, 572, 573)
    *   `inc_SUBSCRIPTIONS.asp` (line 163)
    *   Vulnerable parameters: `Avatar_URL`, `LINK1`, and `LINK2` in the profile editing form.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker could gain unauthorized access to the back-end database.
*   Attackers could add, modify, or delete data within the database.
*   Attackers can potentially read sensitive information, including other users' private messages and potentially gain administrative privileges via injected SQL queries

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely via HTTP requests, typically through a web browser.
*   Attackers inject malicious SQL code into various input fields like `Avatar_URL`, `LINK1`, `LINK2` fields in the user profile editing form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not require authentication
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable SkyPortal application, which means they have network access to the affected application.
*   Attackers can exploit SQL injection by crafting malicious SQL statements via input fields.

**Additional Details:**
* The `exploit-db.com` content provides a specific HTML form example for exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, showing how to modify the `Avatar_URL` field to potentially elevate privileges.
* The `kb.cert.org` content provides a more generalized overview and mentions that automated tools are used to exploit vulnerable sites.
* Both sources confirm that SkyPortal version 1.0 and later versions addressed the vulnerability.
