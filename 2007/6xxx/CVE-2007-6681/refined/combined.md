# Security Advisory 0801

```

Summary           : Format string vulnerability in the Web interface
                    Stack-based buffer overflow in the Subtitles demuxer
                    String buffer overflows in the Real RTSP demuxer
Date              : 27 February 2008, 2 April 2008
Affected versions : VLC media player 0.8.6d and earlier
ID                : VideoLAN-SA-0801
CVE references    : CVE-2007-6681, CVE-2007-6682, CVE-2008-0295, CVE-2008-0296

```
## Details

VLC media player's web interface suffers from a format string vulnerability when using specially crafted requests.

Its subtitle demuxer is prone to multiple buffer overflows triggered by parsing maliciously crafted files.

Its Real RTSP demuxer is based upon an older Xine library fork, which is prone to multiple buffer overflows triggered by maliciously crafted Session Description Protocol (SDP) data or by specific RTSP server responses.

## Impact

If successful, a malicious third party could remotely use the Web interface or the Real RTSP demuxer or locally trigger the subtitles parser to execute arbitrary code within the context of VLC media player or crash the current player instance.

## Threat mitigation

Exploitation of the Web interface problem requires the user to explicitly enable this interface. It is disabled by default.

Subtitle files can be manually opened by the user or automatically based on the filename of the movie. Both ways may lead to exploitation of the Subtitle Parser's buffer-overflow.

Exploitation of the Real RTSP problems requires the user to explicitly open streams provided by malicious third parties.

## Workarounds

The user may refrain from using the Web interface until an update is installed or limit its usage to secure environments. VLC media player can also be controlled remotely through the RC and telnet interfaces.

Automatic detection of subtitle files can be disabled by unchecking the "Autodetect subtitle files" option in the Subtitle category inside the Video preferences. Note that you need to restart VLC media player for this change to take effect. In case that you use VLC media player through the command-line, provide `--no-sub-autodetect-file` to override its default behavior.

The user is asked to use subtitle files authored by trusted sources only.

The user is asked to only open Real RTSP streams from trusted content providers. In case of uncertainess, it is recommended not to open this kind of streams. RTSP streams can easily be identified by the `rtsp` prefix of their URL/MRL.

## Solution

VLC media player 0.8.6e addresses these issues and introduces further
usability fixes. Version 0.8.6f implements additional security improvements to the Subtitle Parser.

Pre-compiled packages will be available at the usual download locations shortly.

## Credits

The Subtitle Parser vulnerability was discovered by Michal Luczaj.

The Web interface vulnerability was reported by Luigi Auriemma.

The Real RTSP demuxer vulnerabilities were published by Luigi Auriemma.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

VideoLAN (VLC) is one of the most famous and used media players for
various reasons: simple to use, open source, multi platform, many
features available, continuosly updated and more.

---------------------------------------------------
A] buffer-overflow in the handling of the subtitles
---------------------------------------------------
VLC is able to handle the subtitles automatically in a very simple way,
it just checks the presence of ssa files with the same name of the
loaded video and a possible subtitles folder.
The functions which handle the MicroDvd, SSA and Vplayer subtitle
formats are vulnerable to some stack based buffer-overflow
vulnerabilities which can allow an attacker to execute malicious code.
from modules\demux\subtitle.c:
static int ParseMicroDvd( demux\_t \*p\_demux, subtitle\_t \*p\_subtitle )
...
char buffer\_text[MAX\_LINE + 1];
...
if( sscanf( s, "{%d}{}%[^\r\n]", &i\_start, buffer\_text ) == 2 ||
sscanf( s, "{%d}{%d}%[^\r\n]", &i\_start, &i\_stop, buffer\_text ) == 3)
static int ParseSSA( demux\_t \*p\_demux, subtitle\_t \*p\_subtitle )
...
char buffer\_text[ 10 \* MAX\_LINE];
char buffer\_text2[ 10 \* MAX\_LINE];
...
if( sscanf( s,
"Dialogue: %[^,],%d:%d:%d.%d,%d:%d:%d.%d,%[^\r\n]",
buffer\_text2,
&h1, &m1, &s1, &c1,

As written in the header of this advisory, these buffer-overflow bugs
have been originally found and reported by Michal Luczaj this summer
and the strange thing is that the SVN is fixed from that time BUT the
current 0.8.6d (both executables and source code!) is still vulnerable.

B] format string in the web interface
-------------------------------------
VLC can be controlled remotely through a nice web interface (a mini
http server) which runs by default on port 8080.
The instructions which handle the Connection parameter sent by the
client pass its content to the httpd\_MsgAdd function without the
needed format argument.
In addition the new formatted Connection field is also sent back by the
server in its reply, very useful for the attacker to tune the own
exploit for increasing the percentage of success of the attack.
from network\httpd.c:
static int httpd\_FileCallBack( httpd\_callback\_sys\_t \*p\_sys, httpd\_client\_t \*cl, httpd\_message\_t \*answer, httpd\_message\_t \*query )
...
psz\_connection = httpd\_MsgGet( &cl->query, "Connection" );
if( psz\_connection != NULL )
{
httpd\_MsgAdd( answer, "Connection", psz\_connection );

# VLC: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200804-25**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC, allowing for the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/vlc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.8.6f** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.8.6f** |

### Background

VLC is a cross-platform media player and streaming server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC:

* Luigi Auriemma discovered that the stack-based buffer overflow when
  reading subtitles, which has been reported as CVE-2007-6681 in GLSA
  200803-13, was not properly fixed (CVE-2008-1881).
* Alin Rad Pop of Secunia reported an array indexing vulnerability in the
  sdpplin\_parse() function when processing streams from RTSP servers in
  Xine code, which is also used in VLC (CVE-2008-0073).
* Drew Yao and Nico Golde reported an integer overflow in the
  MP4\_ReadBox\_rdrf() function in the file libmp4.c leading to a
  heap-based buffer overflow when reading MP4 files (CVE-2008-1489).
* Drew Yao also reported integer overflows in the MP4 demuxer,
  the Real demuxer and in the Cinepak codec, which might lead to buffer
  overflows (CVE-2008-1768).
* Drew Yao finally discovered and a
  boundary error in Cinepak, which might lead to memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-1769).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted media
file or stream, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary
code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All VLC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/vlc-0.8.6f"
```

                 CVE-2008-0296 CVE-2008-0073 CVE-2008-0984 CVE-2008-1489

Luigi Auriemma, Alin Rad Pop, RÃ©mi Denis-Courmont, Quovodis, Guido
Landi, Felipe Manzano, Anibal Sacco and others discovered multiple
vulnerabilities in vlc, an application for playback and streaming of
audio and video.  In the worst case, these weaknesses permit a remote,
unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges
of the user running vlc.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following eight problems:

CVE-2007-6681

    A buffer overflow vulnerability in subtitle handling allows an
    attacker to execute arbitrary code through the opening of a
    maliciously crafted MicroDVD, SSA or Vplayer file.

CVE-2007-6682

    A format string vulnerability in the HTTP-based remote control
    facility of the vlc application allows a remote, unauthenticated
    attacker to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-6683

    Insecure argument validation allows a remote attacker to overwrite
    arbitrary files writable by the user running vlc, if a maliciously
    crafted M3U playlist or MP3 audio file is opened.

CVE-2008-0295, CVE-2008-0296

    Heap buffer overflows in RTSP stream and session description
    protocol (SDP) handling allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
    code if a maliciously-crafted RTSP stream is played.

CVE-2008-0073

    Insufficient integer bounds checking in SDP handling allows the
    execution of arbitrary code through a maliciously crafted SDP
    stream ID parameter in an RTSP stream.

CVE-2008-0984

    Insufficient integrity checking in the MP4 demuxer allows a remote
    attacker to overwrite arbitrary memory and execute arbitrary code
    if a maliciously-crafted MP4 file is opened.

CVE-2008-1489

    An integer overflow vulnerability in MP4 handling allows a remote
    attacker to cause a heap buffer overflow, inducing a crash and
    possibly the execution of arbitrary code if a maliciously-crafted
    MP4 file is opened.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.6-svn20061012.debian-5.1+etch2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.8.e-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.

# VLC: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200803-13**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC, allowing for the execution of
arbitrary code and Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/vlc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.8.6e** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.8.6e** |

### Background

VLC is a cross-platform media player and streaming server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC:

* Michal Luczaj
  and Luigi Auriemma reported that VLC contains boundary errors when
  handling subtitles in the ParseMicroDvd(), ParseSSA(), and
  ParseVplayer() functions in the modules/demux/subtitle.c file, allowing
  for a stack-based buffer overflow (CVE-2007-6681).
* The web
  interface listening on port 8080/tcp contains a format string error in
  the httpd\_FileCallBack() function in the network/httpd.c file
  (CVE-2007-6682).
* The browser plugin possibly contains an
  argument injection vulnerability (CVE-2007-6683).
* The RSTP
  module triggers a NULL pointer dereference when processing a request
  without a "Transport" parameter (CVE-2007-6684).
* Luigi
  Auriemma and Remi Denis-Courmont found a boundary error in the
  modules/access/rtsp/real\_sdpplin.c file when processing SDP data for
  RTSP sessions (CVE-2008-0295) and a vulnerability in the
  libaccess\_realrtsp plugin (CVE-2008-0296), possibly resulting in a
  heap-based buffer overflow.
* Felipe Manzano and Anibal Sacco
  (Core Security Technologies) discovered an arbitrary memory overwrite
  vulnerability in VLC's MPEG-4 file format parser (CVE-2008-0984).

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a long subtitle in a file that a user is
enticed to open, a specially crafted MP4 input file, long SDP data, or
a specially crafted HTTP request with a "Connection" header value
containing format specifiers, possibly resulting in the remote
execution of arbitrary code. Also, a Denial of Service could be caused
and arbitrary files could be overwritten via the "demuxdump-file"
option in a filename in a playlist or via an EXTVLCOPT statement in an
MP3 file.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All VLC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/vlc-0.8.6e"
```

# Security Advisory 0801

```

Summary           : Format string vulnerability in the Web interface
                    Stack-based buffer overflow in the Subtitles demuxer
                    String buffer overflows in the Real RTSP demuxer
Date              : 27 February 2008, 2 April 2008
Affected versions : VLC media player 0.8.6d and earlier
ID                : VideoLAN-SA-0801
CVE references    : CVE-2007-6681, CVE-2007-6682, CVE-2008-0295, CVE-2008-0296

```
## Details

VLC media player's web interface suffers from a format string vulnerability when using specially crafted requests.

Its subtitle demuxer is prone to multiple buffer overflows triggered by parsing maliciously crafted files.

Its Real RTSP demuxer is based upon an older Xine library fork, which is prone to multiple buffer overflows triggered by maliciously crafted Session Description Protocol (SDP) data or by specific RTSP server responses.

## Impact

If successful, a malicious third party could remotely use the Web interface or the Real RTSP demuxer or locally trigger the subtitles parser to execute arbitrary code within the context of VLC media player or crash the current player instance.

## Threat mitigation

Exploitation of the Web interface problem requires the user to explicitly enable this interface. It is disabled by default.

Subtitle files can be manually opened by the user or automatically based on the filename of the movie. Both ways may lead to exploitation of the Subtitle Parser's buffer-overflow.

Exploitation of the Real RTSP problems requires the user to explicitly open streams provided by malicious third parties.

## Workarounds

The user may refrain from using the Web interface until an update is installed or limit its usage to secure environments. VLC media player can also be controlled remotely through the RC and telnet interfaces.

Automatic detection of subtitle files can be disabled by unchecking the "Autodetect subtitle files" option in the Subtitle category inside the Video preferences. Note that you need to restart VLC media player for this change to take effect. In case that you use VLC media player through the command-line, provide `--no-sub-autodetect-file` to override its default behavior.

The user is asked to use subtitle files authored by trusted sources only.

The user is asked to only open Real RTSP streams from trusted content providers. In case of uncertainess, it is recommended not to open this kind of streams. RTSP streams can easily be identified by the `rtsp` prefix of their URL/MRL.

## Solution

VLC media player 0.8.6e addresses these issues and introduces further
usability fixes. Version 0.8.6f implements additional security improvements to the Subtitle Parser.

Pre-compiled packages will be available at the usual download locations shortly.

## Credits

The Subtitle Parser vulnerability was discovered by Michal Luczaj.

The Web interface vulnerability was reported by Luigi Auriemma.

The Real RTSP demuxer vulnerabilities were published by Luigi Auriemma.

===============
1) Introduction
===============
VideoLAN (VLC) is one of the most famous and used media players for
various reasons: simple to use, open source, multi platform, many
features available, continuosly updated and more.
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
---------------------------------------------------
A] buffer-overflow in the handling of the subtitles
---------------------------------------------------
VLC is able to handle the subtitles automatically in a very simple way,
it just checks the presence of ssa files with the same name of the
loaded video and a possible subtitles folder.
The functions which handle the MicroDvd, SSA and Vplayer subtitle
formats are vulnerable to some stack based buffer-overflow
vulnerabilities which can allow an attacker to execute malicious code.
from modules\demux\subtitle.c:
static int ParseMicroDvd( demux\_t \*p\_demux, subtitle\_t \*p\_subtitle )
...
char buffer\_text[MAX\_LINE + 1];
...
if( sscanf( s, "{%d}{}%[^\r\n]", &i\_start, buffer\_text ) == 2 ||
sscanf( s, "{%d}{%d}%[^\r\n]", &i\_start, &i\_stop, buffer\_text ) == 3)
static int ParseSSA( demux\_t \*p\_demux, subtitle\_t \*p\_subtitle )
...
char buffer\_text[ 10 \* MAX\_LINE];
char buffer\_text2[ 10 \* MAX\_LINE];
...
if( sscanf( s,
"Dialogue: %[^,],%d:%d:%d.%d,%d:%d:%d.%d,%[^\r\n]",
buffer\_text2,
&h1, &m1, &s1, &c1,
&h2, &m2, &s2, &c2,
buffer\_text ) == 10 )
UPDATE 16 Mar 2008
in version 0.8.6e we have the following "wrong" change which leaves
buffer\_text2 still vulnerable:
"Dialogue: %[^,],%d:%d:%d.%d,%d:%d:%d.%d,%81920[^\r\n]"
static int ParseVplayer( demux\_t \*p\_demux, subtitle\_t \*p\_subtitle )
...
char buffer\_text[MAX\_LINE + 1];
...
if( sscanf( p, "%d:%d:%d%[ :]%[^\r\n]", &h, &m, &s, &c, buffer\_text ) == 5 )
As written in the header of this advisory, these buffer-overflow bugs
have been originally found and reported by Michal Luczaj this summer
and the strange thing is that the SVN is fixed from that time BUT the
current 0.8.6d (both executables and source code!) is still vulnerable.

-------------------------------------
B] format string in the web interface
-------------------------------------
VLC can be controlled remotely through a nice web interface (a mini
http server which must be manually activated) that runs by default on
port 8080.
The instructions which handle the Connection parameter sent by the
client pass its content to the httpd\_MsgAdd function without the
needed format argument.
In addition the new formatted Connection field is also sent back by the
server in its reply, very useful for the attacker to tune the own
exploit for increasing the percentage of success of the attack.
from network\httpd.c:
static int httpd\_FileCallBack( httpd\_callback\_sys\_t \*p\_sys, httpd\_client\_t \*cl, httpd\_message\_t \*answer, httpd\_message\_t \*query )
...
psz\_connection = httpd\_MsgGet( &cl->query, "Connection" );
if( psz\_connection != NULL )
{
httpd\_MsgAdd( answer, "Connection", psz\_connection );
}

A] open vlcbof.avi and the ssa subtitle will be loaded automatically
B] nc SERVER 8080 -v -v < vlcfs.txt
