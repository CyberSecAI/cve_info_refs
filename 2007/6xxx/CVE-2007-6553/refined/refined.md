{
  "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to both Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to the insecure use of the `CONF[app_root]` parameter in multiple include files and the `lang` parameter in multiple php pages.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary local or remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server, information disclosure, or denial of service.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "HTTP GET requests with a manipulated `CONF[app_root]` parameter in vulnerable include files.",
    "HTTP GET requests with a manipulated `lang` parameter in vulnerable php pages."
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker can be remote."
