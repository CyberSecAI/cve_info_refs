  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly uses user-supplied input in an SQL query without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the 'rss.php' file, specifically in the 'albumnr' parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can retrieve sensitive information like the admin username and password hash from the database.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious SQL query through the 'albumnr' GET parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application and be able to read the response to extract the leaked data."
