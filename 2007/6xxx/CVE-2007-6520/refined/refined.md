Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-6520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2007-6520 is a flaw in how Opera handles plug-ins, which allows for cross-domain scripting attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Domain Scripting:** The core vulnerability is that plug-ins within the Opera browser can be manipulated to bypass cross-domain restrictions. This means a malicious script from one domain could access resources from another domain, which should normally be prohibited for security reasons.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-domain scripting:** Attackers could potentially use the vulnerability to execute arbitrary scripts within the context of a different domain. This could lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, data theft, and defacement.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not directly stated for CVE-2007-6520, it is grouped with CVE-2007-6521 (arbitrary code execution) and can possibly contribute to it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker could host a malicious web page that exploits this vulnerability when visited by a user with a vulnerable version of Opera.
- **Compromised Web Pages:** An attacker could inject malicious code into a legitimate web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, not requiring any physical access to the victim's machine.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know how to craft the malicious content or scripts to trigger the cross-domain scripting vulnerability through plug-ins.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by David Bloom.
- The issue was resolved in Opera version 9.25.
- Details of the vulnerability were to be disclosed at a later date.
- The vulnerability is related to how plug-ins interact with web pages.
