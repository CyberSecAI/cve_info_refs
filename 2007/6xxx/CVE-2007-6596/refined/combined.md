TK53 Advisory #2 12/29/2007
- Multiple vulnerabilities in ClamAV
========================================================================
\* Authors: Roflek of TK53 <roflek1337 (at) gmail (dot) com [email concealed]>, Lolek of TK53
<lolek1337 (at) gmail (dot) com [email concealed]>
\* Affected program: ClamAV (http://www.clamav.net/)
\* Affected versions: 0.92
\* Overwiew:
1) ClamAV uses own functions to create temporary files. One such routine is
vulnerable to a race condition attack.
2) ClamAV fails to properly check for base64-UUEncoded files, allowing
bypassing of the scanner through the use of such files.
3) The sigtool utility included in the ClamAV distribution fails to handle
created files in a secure way.
==========================================
== Race Condition Vulnerability Details ==
==========================================
$SOURCE/libclamav/others.c (line 488):
int cli\_gentempfd(const char \*dir, char \*\*name, int \*fd)
{
\*name = cli\_gentemp(dir);
if(!\*name)
return CL\_EMEM;
\*fd = open(\*name, O\_RDWR|O\_CREAT|O\_TRUNC|O\_BINARY, S\_IRWXU);
if(\*fd == -1) {
cli\_errmsg("cli\_gentempfd: Can't create temporary file %s:
%s\n", \*name, strerror(errno));
free(\*name);
return CL\_EIO;
}
return CL\_SUCCESS;
}
This function, cli\_gentempfd, uses a custom function to generate a
(more or less)
unique file name which is then opened, and the file descriptor is returned via
an output parameter.
The problem with this code is that a race condition exists: if the attacker is
able to guess the generated file name, he/she is able to create such a named
file between the call of cli\_gentemp() and open(), making it possible to
overwrite arbitrary files to which the user that runs ClamAV has write access
with temporary data. A solution to fix this problem is to use the O\_EXCL option
for open(). This option prevents that the file will be opened if it already
exists.
So, how does the file name generation happen? First, cli\_gentemp() determines
the temporary directory. Users of the cli\_gentemp() function can specify their
own custom temporary directory. If none is specified, then the content of the
TMPDIR environment variable is used. If the environment variable is unset, then
P\_tmpdir resp. "/tmp" are used. The generated format of the file name is
$TMPDIR/clamav-$HASH, where $HASH is generated from a fixed 16 byte "salt" and
32 (more or less) random bytes.
The salt is defined in the following way:
static unsigned char name\_salt[16] = { 16, 38, 97, 12, 8, 4, 72, 196,
217, 144, 33, 124, 18, 11, 17, 253 };
The random bytes are generated with an internal function cli\_rndnum()
which looks
like this:
unsigned int cli\_rndnum(unsigned int max)
{
struct timeval tv;
gettimeofday(&tv, (struct timezone \*) 0);
srand(tv.tv\_usec+clock());
return rand() % max;
}
As you can see, every time cli\_rndnum() is called, the random number generator
is reinitialized with the microsecond component of the current time and an
"approximation of the processor time used by the program" using the clock()
function. This takes away a lot of randomness from the value returned by
cli\_rndnum(): as seed, more or less public information which should be
relatively easy to be guessed by the attacker is used, making it possible to
guess the value returned by rand(). Also, since the random number generator is
reseeded every time cli\_rndnum() is called, every returned value is directly
computed from the seed.
In addition, cli\_rndnum() uses the modulo operator to "cut off" the random
number at a maximum value, which is discouraged by virtually every documentation
of the rand() function. The publication "Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of
Scientific Computing"[0] says about the use of rand():
"If you want to generate a random integer between 1 and 10, you
should always do it by using high-order bits, as in
j=1+(int) (10.0\*rand()/(RAND\_MAX+1.0));
and never by anything resembling
j=1+(rand() % 10);
(which uses lower-order bits)."
The function cli\_gentempfd() is used throughout the whole ClamAV source code in
numerous places, which means that all these places are affected by the race
conditions. Ironically, the code also uses cli\_gentemp() in several places to
generate a random file name and then passes the file name to call to open()
with the O\_EXCL option enabled.
The race condition was introduced to the ClamAV source code on August 31st,
2007, in SVN revision 3196. The first release that contains the bug was 0.92.
Since then, the code has remained in the trunk of the SVN repository.
======================================================
== Base64 UUEncoded Files Scanner Bypassing Details ==
======================================================
ClamAV contains functionality to unpack and scan different types of files, such
as archive files. Beside others, UUEncoded files are supported, too.
But ClamAV a variation of the UUEncoded file format: uuencode implementations,
such as the one supplied by the GNU sharutils package, support the use of
BASE64 instead of the uuencode-proprietary encoding, making it possible to
create uuencode files slightly smaller. These files start with "begin-base64"
instead of the usual "begin " of UUEncoded files.
When ClamAV tries to determine a file's type through its magic number at the
beginning, it correctly recognizes files that start with "begin ", but fail to
recognize Base64-UUEncoded files, since it's not in the list of checked magic
numbers.
This makes it possible for attackers to bypass scanning of archive files by
packing e.g. malware into a Base64-UUEncoded file, which the user then opens.
As history has shown, social-engineering-based attacks with unknown file
attachments have been successful a lot of times. This fact makes such an attack
sound more realistic, especially since many users blindly trust their virus
scanner. In cases where ClamAV is the only virus scanner in the mail delivery
process, and then fails to scan Base64-UUEncoded malware, this would be even
more serious, since naive users may open unknown files without suspicion "since
the virus scanner has checked them already and found nothing".
===============================================
== Insecure File Handling in Sigtool Details ==
===============================================
Sigtool as shipped in a ClamAV installation is vulnerable to insecure
file handling
in some cases. If Sigtool is used with the 'utf16-decode' it fails to
check if the
<filename>.ascii file already exists and thus allowing an attacker
with write permissions
to the directory in which <filename> is located (for example if Sigtool is used
in /tmp/) to overwrite arbitrary files belonging to the user via a
symlink attack.
sigtool.c:
156 fname = opt\_arg(opt, "utf16-decode");
157 if((fd1 = open(fname, O\_RDONLY)) == -1) {
158 mprintf("!utf16decode: Can't open file %s\n", fname);
159 return -1;
160 }
161
162 newname = malloc(strlen(fname) + 7);
163 sprintf(newname, "%s.ascii", fname);
164
165 if((fd2 = open(newname, O\_WRONLY|O\_CREAT|O\_TRUNC, S\_IRWXU)) < 0) {
166 mprintf("!utf16decode: Can't create file %s\n", newname);
open is missing O\_EXCL and thanks to the usage of O\_TRUNC the file will be
truncated to size zero.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
