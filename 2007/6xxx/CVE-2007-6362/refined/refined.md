```
Root cause of vulnerability: The "catid" parameter in the rsgallery component for Joomla/Mambo is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection.
Impact of exploitation: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials (username and password hashes).
Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a web browser by manipulating the "catid" parameter in the URL.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker does not require any prior authentication. Successful exploitation requires "magic_quotes" to be off in the PHP configuration.
