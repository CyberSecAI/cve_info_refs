| [Description](#c0)  Magellan    2003-05-03 07:15:40 UTC  ``` In the past, I used to do a "loadkeys fr_CH" just at the beginning of the install but since the 1.4_rc3 release the fr_CH keymap (Swiss French) no more appears on the livecd.  I submit the bug because on the releases older than the 1.4_rc3 the fr_CH keymap was included on the livecd. And for people using a swiss french keyboard that's not like the german nor the french one, it's really irritating to try to guess where the "a" is ...  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Boot with the 1.4_rc4 livecd 2. At the command line, type : "loadkeys fr_CH" Actual Results:   The result of the command is :  "cannot open file fr_CH" ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Bob Johnson (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-01-20 15:25:15 UTC  ``` I think this was fixed for release, reopen if not please ``` |  |

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : mantis
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2006-6574 CVE-2007-6611
Debian Bug     : 402802 458377

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mantis, a web based
bug tracking system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2006-6574

    Custom fields were not appropriately protected by per-item access
    control, allowing for sensitive data to be published.

CVE-2007-6611

    Multiple cross site scripting issues allowed a remote attacker to
    insert malicious HTML or web script into Mantis web pages.

The stable distribution (etch) is not affected by these problems.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.19.2-5sarge5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.8-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your mantis package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=427277#c0)  Lubomir Kundrak    2008-01-02 18:44:12 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  From secunia:  seiji has discovered a vulnerability in Mantis, which can be exploited by malicious users to conduct script insertion attacks.  Input passed as the filename for the uploaded file in bug_report.php is not properly sanitised before being stored. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which is executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site when the malicious filename is viewed in view.php.  Successful exploitation requires valid user credentials.  The vulnerability is confirmed in version 1.0.8. Other versions may also be affected.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  mantis-1.0.8-1  Additional info:  <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=8679> <http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=562940>  There are more things marked "[security]" in the release notes -- I suggest that you rebase the package on 1.1.0.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=427277#c2)  Lubomir Kundrak    2008-01-02 18:46:52 UTC  ``` CVE name for this issue was requested.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=427277#c3)  Lubomir Kundrak    2008-01-03 20:58:31 UTC  ``` This issue got the CVE name [CVE-2007-6611](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-6611)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=427277#c4)  Fedora Update System    2008-01-07 01:20:30 UTC  ``` mantis-1.1.0-1.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=427277#c5)  Fedora Update System    2008-01-07 01:29:51 UTC  ``` mantis-1.1.0-1.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.
