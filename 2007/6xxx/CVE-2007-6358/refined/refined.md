{
  "CVE-2007-6358": {
    "Description": "The alternate pdftops filter in CUPS creates temporary files with predictable file names when reading from standard input.",
    "Root cause": "The pdftops.pl script creates temporary files in the /tmp directory using predictable file names based on the process ID ($$).",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure temporary file creation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running the CUPS spooler (usually lp) by using symlink attacks, leading to a denial of service or other potential security issues.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be local and have the ability to control the input to the pdftops filter when it processes data from stdin, which occurs when multiple filters are chained or CUPS is configured to use pdftops to convert stdin data, not a file from /var/spool/cups. The attacker must be able to create a symlink in /tmp and trigger CUPS to process a PDF via stdin through the vulnerable pdftops filter."
