{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from two issues: arbitrary file upload due to insufficient file type validation and source code disclosure through a URL parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Arbitrary file upload: The application allows uploading of arbitrary files by checking only the content-type, which can be easily spoofed. It also allows overriding .htaccess restrictions by uploading a malicious .htaccess file.",
    "Source code disclosure: The application allows retrieval of arbitrary files from the server through the 'suck_url' parameter in edit.php, which doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied URLs before using `file_get_contents`."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload malicious files, potentially leading to remote code execution and take control of the webserver. Additionally, the attacker can disclose sensitive source code, including configuration files, exposing secrets and further weakening the security of the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vectors are through HTTP requests. An attacker can upload arbitrary files via the /fisheye/upload.php endpoint by crafting a request with a modified content-type. An attacker can also disclose arbitrary files via the /wiki/edit.php endpoint by sending a crafted request with a 'suck_url' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication seems to be required to exploit these issues."
