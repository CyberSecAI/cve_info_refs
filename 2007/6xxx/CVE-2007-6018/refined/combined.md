I'm pretty sure I shouldn't be able to do this.    It is intentional that certain groups are displayed even to non-members, allowing them to restrict bug visibility to such groups (e.g. when providing some confidential information or reporting non-public security issue).  As non-member, you should not be able to remove group restriction though.  Group visibility to non-members is per-product setting.  The groups you have selected are not needed to be visible for 'Security Response' product, therefore that Bugzilla setting was changed.  You should still be able to see 'Security Sensitive Bug' group and restrict bug to that group, but that's intentional.   ``` |  |

```
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Horde
Application Framework version 3.1.6.

This is a bugfix release that also improves XSS (cross site scripting)
filters, used for example in HTML message viewers, and fixes privilege
escalations in the Horde API. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this
version.

Many thanks to Secunia for reporting an XSS vulnerability (CVE-2007-6018) and
working with us to test the fixes.

The Horde Application Framework is a modular, general-purpose web application
framework written in PHP. It provides an extensive array of libraries that are
targeted at the common problems and tasks involved in developing modern web
applications.

Major changes compared to Horde 3.1.5 are:
    * Fixed privilege escalation in the Horde API.
    * Improved XSS filtering.
    * Fixed locked portal blocks.
    * Further improved webroot detection.
    * Updated Japanese translation.

The full list of changes (from version 3.1.5) can be viewed here:

<http://cvs.horde.org/diff.php/horde/docs/CHANGES?r1=1.515.2.306&r2=1.515.2.312.2.2&ty=h>

The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Horde Groupware
Webmail Edition version 1.0.4.

This is a bugfix release that also improves XSS (cross site scripting)
filters, used for example in HTML message viewers, and fixes privilege
escalations in the Horde API and missing ownership validation in the share
management. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this version.

Many thanks to Secunia for reporting an XSS vulnerability (CVE-2007-6018) and
working with us to test the fixes.

Horde Groupware Webmail Edition is a free, enterprise ready, browser based
communication suite. Users can read, send and organize email messages and
manage and share calendars, contacts, tasks and notes with the standards
compliant components from the Horde Project.

Major changes compared to Horde Groupware Webmail Edition 1.0.3 are:
    * Fixed privilege escalation in the Horde API.
    * Fixed missing ownership validation on share changes.
    * Improved XSS filtering.
    * Fixed locked portal blocks.
    * Further improved webroot detection.
    * Improved sieve forward rules.
    * Updated Finnish, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese,
      Spanish, and Traditional Chinese translations.
    * Small bugfixes and improvements.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1470-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : horde3
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitising
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-6018

Ulf Harnhammer discovered that the HTML filter of the Horde web
application framework performed insufficient input sanitising, which
may lead to the deletion of emails if a user is tricked into viewing
a malformed email inside the Imp client.

This update also provides backported bugfixes to the cross-site
scripting filter and the user management API from the latest Horde
release 3.1.6.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.3-4etch2.

The old stable distribution (sarge) is not affected. An update to
Etch is recommended, though.

We recommend that you upgrade your horde3 package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian 4.0 (stable)
- -------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- vim, gvim
The VI Improved editor (vim) was prone to several security problems:
CVE-2008-4677: The netrw plugin sent credentials to all servers.
CVE-2008-2712: Arbitrary code execution in vim helper plugins
filetype, zip, xpm, gzip and netrw.
CVE-2008-3074: tarplugin code injection
CVE-2008-3075: zipplugin code injection
CVE-2008-3076: several netrw bugs, code injection
CVE-2008-6235: code injection in the netrw plugin
CVE-2008-4677: credential disclosure by netrw plugin
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLES10
On openSUSE vim was upgraded to version 7.2.108 to fix those issues.
SLES9 and 10 were only affected by a subset, patches were backported
to fix the problems.
- apache2
A DoS condition in apache2's mod\_proxy has been fixed
(CVE-2008-2364).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3
- opera
Opera 9.64 is a recommended security and stability upgrade,
incorporating the Opera Presto 2.1.1 user agent engine. Opera highly
recommends all users to upgrade to Opera 9.64 to take advantage of
these improvements (CVE-2009-0914, CVE-2009-0915, CVE-2009-0916).
A detailed changelog can be found at
<http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/964/>
- multipath tools
/var/run/multipathd.sock was world-writable allowing local users to
issue commands to the multipath daemon (CVE-2009-0115).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLES10
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
Specially crafted image files could cause an integer overflow in the
lcms library contained in openjdk. Attackers could potentially
exploit that to crash applications using lcms or even execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0723, CVE-2009-0581, CVE-2009-0733).
Previous update packages contained broken dependencies and couldn't
be installed. Therefore the update had to be re-released.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0 and 11.1
- imp
Version update to IMP 4.1.6 fixes a problem with validating HTTP requests that
allowed attackers to delete emails (CVE-2007-6018) and some
cross-site-scripting issues (CVE-2009-0930).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- horde
Version update to horde 3.1.9 fixes a cross-site-scripting (XSS) issue
(CVE-2008-5917) and an include file problem (CVE-2009-0932).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- lcms
Specially crafted image files could cause an integer overflow in
lcms. Attackers could potentially exploit that to crash applications
using lcms or even execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0723,
CVE-2009-0581, CVE-2009-0733).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLES10
- moodle
moodle was prone to several cross-site-scripting (XSS) and
cross-site-request-forgery (CSRF) problems (CVE-2009-0499, CVE-2009-0500,
CVE-2009-0501, CVE-2009-0502).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- ghostscript
Integer overflows and missing upper bounds checks in Ghostscript's
ICC library potentially allowed attackers to crash Ghostscript or
even cause execution of arbitrary code via specially crafted PS or
PDF files (CVE-2009-0583, CVE-2009-0584).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLES9, SLES10

2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
- NetworkManager
The NetworkManager update caused WLAN to stop working on some
systems. Those systems most likely have a stale directory
/var/run/dbus/at\_console/root. It's most likely a leftover from a
root session. Removing the directory and restarting networking
should fix the problems. Please avoid logging in as root in the future.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
