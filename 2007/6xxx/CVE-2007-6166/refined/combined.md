### QuickTime - Remote hacker automatic control

| Version: | 7.2 to 7.3 |
| --- | --- |
| Technical Details: | A vulnerability exists in versions 7.2 and 7.3 of QuickTime (and possibly earlier versions) where the RSTP response can be manipulated to result in arbitrary code execution on a vulnerable system (despite attempts at filtering unwanted characters).  This vulnerability quickly spread from POC to exploit code, but at this stage only targets the Windows versions of QuickTime. |
| Description: | In what appears to be a similar vulnerability to one highlighted at the start of the year, as part of the Month of Mac Bugs project [Alerted to here (security item 1.1)](http://skiifwrald.com/pipermail/alertmailinglist_skiifwrald.com/2007-January/000269.html), exploit code has begun circulating for an exploitable vulnerability in Apple's QuickTime media platform.  At this stage, the vulnerability targets the Windows XP and Vista versions of QuickTime, and currently targets 7.2 and 7.3 (the newest version). |
| Mitigation: | Concerned users and administrators may disable support for the rtsp protocol through the QuickTime Control Panel / Preference Pane and selecting the File Types / Advanced -> MIME Settings and deselecting the RTSP stream description under the Streaming - Streaming Movies option.  RTSP support may have already been disabled (due to prior mitigation steps for earlier vulnerabilities), and this setting may already be deselected by default in the latest versions (thanks to US-CERT). US-CERT also advise that this step MAY NOT block attacks and suggest blocking the rtsp:// protocol at the network perimeter, avoiding QuickTime material from untrusted sources, and hardening your browser. |

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Win32 binary codecs: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200803-08**

Multiple vulnerabilities in the Win32 codecs for Linux may result in the
remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/win32codecs** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **20071007-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **20071007-r2** |

### Background

Win32 binary codecs provide support for video and audio playback.

### Description

Multiple buffer overflow, heap overflow, and integer overflow
vulnerabilities were discovered in the Quicktime plugin when processing
MOV, FLC, SGI, H.264 and FPX files.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted video
file, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Win32 binary codecs users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/win32codecs-20071007-r2"
```

Note: Since no updated binary versions have been released, the
Quicktime libraries have been removed from the package. Please use the
free alternative Quicktime implementations within VLC, MPlayer or Xine
for playback.

## Apple QuickTime RTSP Content-Type header stack buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#659761

Original Release Date: 2007-11-24 | Last Revised: 2008-01-11

---

### Overview

Apple QuickTime contains a stack buffer overflow vulnerability that may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| Real Time Streaming Protocol ([RTSP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2326)) is a protocol that is used by streaming media systems. The Apple QuickTime Streaming Server and QuickTime player both support RTSP.  Apple QuickTime contains a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the way QuickTime handles the RTSP [Content-Type](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2326#section-12.16) header. This vulnerability may be exploited by convincing a user to connect to a specially crafted RTSP stream. Note that QuickTime is a component of Apple iTunes, therefore iTunes installations are also affected by this vulnerability. We are aware of publicly available exploit code for this vulnerability.Testing indicates that QuickTime versions 4.0 through 7.3 are vulnerable on all supported Mac and Windows platforms. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to connect to a specially crafted RTSP stream, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. An attacker can use various types of web page content, including a QuickTime Media Link file, to cause a user to load an RTSP stream. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apple has released QuickTime [7.3.1](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=307176) to address this issue. Until updates can be applied, please consider the following workarounds. Note that these workarounds block certain attack vectors, but do not remove the vulnerability. |
| --- |

| **Uninstall QuickTime**Until updates are available, uninstalling QuickTime will mitigate this vulnerability. Note that uninstalling QuickTime will make applications that rely on QuickTime (such as iTunes) fail to run or run with limited functionality.**Block the** **rtsp://** **protocol**Blocking the RTSP protocol with proxy or firewall rules may help mitigate this vulnerability. Blocking outbound access to 554/tcp and 6970-6999/udp may partially mitigate this vulnerability. Since RTSP may use a variety of port numbers, blocking the protocol based on a particular port may not be sufficient. **Secure your web browser**Follow the guidelines described in the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/) document. These guidelines include several mitigations against this vulnerability, such as disabling downloads from untrusted sites in Internet Explorer on Microsoft Windows systems and disabling the option to *Open "safe" files after downloading* in Safari on Apple Mac systems.**Disable the QuickTime ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer**The QuickTime ActiveX controls can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSIDs:{02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B}{4063BE15-3B08-470D-A0D5-B37161CFFD69}More information about how to set the kill bit is available in [Microsoft Support Document 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for these controls:Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{4063BE15-3B08-470D-A0D5-B37161CFFD69}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400**Disable the QuickTime plug-in for Mozilla-based browsers**Users of Mozilla-based browsers, such as Firefox can disable the QuickTime plugin, as specified in the PluginDoc article [Uninstalling Plugins](http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/faqs/uninstall.html).**Disable the RTSP protocol handler**Mac OS X users can disable the RTSP protocol handler by editing the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist file with Property List Editor. Change the LSHandlerRoleAll value associated with the rtsp LSHanlderURLScheme to something other than com.apple.quicktimeplayer. This process can be simplified by using an application such as [RCDefaultApp](http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/). Microsoft Windows users should not need to make any changes, as QuickTime does not appear to register itself as the handler for the RTSP protocol on Windows systems.**Disable file association for QuickTime files**Disable the file association for QuickTime file types to help prevent windows applications from using Apple QuickTime to open QuickTime files. This can be accomplished by deleting the following registry keys:HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\QuickTime.\*This will remove the association for approximately 32 file types that are configured to open with the QuickTime Player software. **Disable QuickTime as the RTSP protocol handler on OS X**To disable the RTSP registered protocol handler in OS X open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist and look through ahundred or more entries to find RTSP and change it to something else.**Disable JavaScript**For instructions on how to disable JavaScript, please refer to the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/) document. This can help prevent some attack techniques that use the QuickTime plug-in or ActiveX control.**Do not access QuickTime files from untrusted sources**Attackers may host malicious QuickTime files on web sites. In order to convince users to visit their sites, those attackers often use a variety of techniques to create misleading links including URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, and intentional misspellings. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. |

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
