{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-6202",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the search functionality of the Seditio CMS, allowing for SQL injection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the backend database. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, potentially compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the application and its data. It also allows an attacker to retrieve user password hashes.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `plug.php?e=search&a=search` endpoint with malicious SQL code injected into the search parameters.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker also needs to know the target user ID to successfully retrieve the password hash. The vulnerability requires `magic_quotes_gpc` to be turned off on the server."
