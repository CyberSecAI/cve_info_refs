{
  "CVE-2007-6203": {
    "Description": "Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x and 2.2.x does not sanitize the HTTP Method specifier header from an HTTP request when it is reflected back in a \"413 Request Entity Too Large\" error message, which might allow cross-site scripting (XSS) style attacks using web client components that can send arbitrary headers in requests, as demonstrated via an HTTP request containing an invalid Content-length value, a similar issue to CVE-2006-3918.",
    "Root cause": "The HTTP Method specifier from the request is not sanitized before being included in the 413 error response.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper output sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser by sending a crafted HTTP request, leading to actions like defacement, redirection of sensitive information, and cookie manipulation.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Malicious HTTP requests with a crafted HTTP method"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to force the victim's browser to submit a malformed HTTP method with malicious javascript as the method itself. This could be done using vulnerable Flash plugins."
