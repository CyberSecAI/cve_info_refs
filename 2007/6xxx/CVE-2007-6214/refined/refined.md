- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `file_download.php` script in LearnLoop 2.0beta7 improperly handles the `sFilePath` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize or validate the user-supplied file path via the `sFilePath` parameter before using it to access files on the server. This allows an attacker to bypass intended restrictions and access files outside of the intended directory.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially disclosing sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, and user data.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable through a web request to the `file_download.php` script by manipulating the `sFilePath` parameter. Specifically, using `../` sequences in the parameter allows an attacker to navigate up directories.
   
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable LearnLoop application and have knowledge of the file structure. The exploit can be achieved remotely.
