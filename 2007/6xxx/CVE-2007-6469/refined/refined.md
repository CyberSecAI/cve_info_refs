The content provided describes two vulnerabilities in phpRPG version 0.8.0: SQL injection and session information disclosure.

**SQL Injection**

*   **Root cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the login process. Specifically, the application does not properly handle single quotes in the username field when `magic_quotes_gpc` is off.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization, allowing for SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can bypass the login mechanism and gain administrative access by injecting SQL code into the username field.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted username string to the login form, specifically `1'or 1=1 limit 1/*` when `magic_quotes_gpc` is off. The password field is also mentioned as part of the attack vector, but the provided information does not indicate a need to modify the password to succeed.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to submit data to the login form. They also need to know that the `magic_quotes_gpc` option is off on the server.

**Session Information Disclosure**

*   **Root cause:** The application uses `session_save_path()` to store session files in a publicly accessible directory (`/tmp/`).
*   **Weaknesses:** Session files are stored in a directory accessible over HTTP.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can steal any session registered by phpRPG by accessing the session files through the web server.
*   **Attack vector:** Navigating to the `/tmp/` directory, or to the directory set by the `session_save_path` function, via a web browser.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the web server, and navigate to the directory containing the session files.
