Package: pioneers
Version: 0.11.2-2
Severity: normal
Tags: security, fixed-upstream, patch

By sending special codes to the pioneers server, it can be made to
crash.  The game that was in progress is lost when this happens.
It is not possible to execute code using this bug.

The patch for this problem is here:
<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1791176&group_id=5095&atid=305095>

It is already applied in the new upstream release, 0.11.3, which I shall
package soon.

Security team: please let me know if I can/should do anything to get
this patch into stable.  I think it should apply directly to the stable
package without problems (but I didn't test that yet).

Thanks,
Bas

thanks

A bug which caused a segmentation fault was fixed, however it is still
possible to crash the server remotely, this time by triggering an
assert.  Therefore I am reopening this bug.

Thanks,

I'm not really sure what triggers it.  Bug #1786686 on sourceforge has
some more info, but none of it is really certain.

```

Hi,

As I wrote before, there was a DoS vulnerability in Pioneers.  While
testing if it also occurred in stable, I found a second problem, which
is now also fixed.  The fix is uploaded to unstable, and should enter
testing in 2 days.  The attached patch fixes both problems in stable.
To use it:

cd /tmp
dget -x ftp://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/pool/main/p/pioneers/pioneers_0.10.2-3.dsc
cd pioneers-0.10.2
patch -p2 < /path/to/patch
dch -i
debuild

The problem is documented on
<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1786686&group_id=5095&atid=105095>
This patch is a combination of the following two patches:
<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1791176&group_id=5095&atid=305095>
<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1833003&group_id=5095&atid=305095>

If you need any more help, let me know.

Thanks,
Bas

Thanks for providing an update, but since we have a wide range of more
important security issues to address it is very unlikely we'll be able
to release an update for crash bugs in a game server, since there
will almost always be new and more grave issues on the plate.

I'd recommend to update this through a stable point update instead.

Cheers,
        Moritz
