{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `sezione_news.php` script.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to sensitive data disclosure (e.g., usernames and password hashes), data modification, or other malicious activities.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request to `sezione_news.php` with a crafted `id` parameter containing malicious SQL code"
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and must be able to inject malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter. No authentication is required as the vulnerability is present before any login process.",
     "additional_information": "The provided PoC demonstrates how an attacker can use a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve user credentials from the `login` table. This can then be used to gain administrative access to the application."
