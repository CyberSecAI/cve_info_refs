Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-6565:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a blind SQL injection vulnerability present in the Blakord Portal software. This vulnerability exists because user-supplied input, likely the `id` parameter, is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection, meaning that the attacker does not receive direct error messages or query results from the database. Instead, the attacker must infer information by observing the application's response to different SQL injection attempts.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The application fails to sanitize the `id` parameter before using it in SQL queries.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `id` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to injection

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials and other confidential information.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to the application and its resources.
*   **Database Manipulation:**  Although it is a blind SQLi, and more difficult, in some cases it can also allow modification of the underlying database through SQL queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to any module of the Blakord Portal, manipulating the `id` parameter.
*   **SQL Injection Payloads:** The attacker injects SQL code using the `id` parameter. Examples include `id=1 and 1=1` (true condition) and `id=1 and 1=2` (false condition) to determine if the application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection, followed by more complex queries to extract information or manipulate the database
*   **Blind Injection:** The attacker does not receive direct output but observes the application's response (e.g., whether or not the page loads).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.
*   **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have a working understanding of SQL to craft malicious queries.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Additional Details (from Exploit-DB and SecurityReason):**
*   **Vulnerable Application:** Blakord Portal Beta 1.3.A (all modules).
*   **Platform:** PHP.
*   **Discovery Date:** 2007-12-26.
*   **Author:** JosS.
*   **Dorks (Search Queries):**  "Power by Blakord Portal", "Powered by Blakord Portal", "Blakord Portal".
*   **Exploitation Examples:** The exploit details provide specific example URLs showing how to test for the vulnerability and extract database information, such as table and column names.
*  **CVSS Base Score:** 7.5/10 (Medium Severity)
