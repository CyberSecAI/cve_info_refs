      "summary": "The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in the `mod_proxy_balancer` module of Apache HTTP Server. It arises when the module doesn't properly sanitize its input before using it in output. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then executed by the victim's browser."
