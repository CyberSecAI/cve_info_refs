How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1- [Remote Attacker] can login to hosting controller Panel. He can also change all others' passwords:
    1.1- http://[HC URL]/hosting/addreseller.asp?reseller=[USERNAME]  -> for ex. [USERNAME]= resadmin
    1.2- Now, to login without changing the password, attacker must run "ChangeDisplay.htm" then redirect to "main.asp"
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1.2.1 ChangeDisplay.htm~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            <script>
            function check(){
                _action = '/AdminSettings/displays.asp?DecideAction=1&ChangeSkin=1'
                frmDisplay.action = window.document.all.URL.value + _action

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    1.3- Attacker, also can change username's password without having current password by "ChangePass.htm"
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1.3.1 ChangePass.htm~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            <script>
            function check(){

2- [User] can copy a file to hosting controller web directory which is executed under administrator's privilege, so attacker can execute his commands by administrator's privilege. For example attacker can gain remote desktop of server by this way and uploading an ASP file!
This bug is because of "inc_newuser.asp" that can set full control permission on each "db","www","Special", or "log" directory on the server.
This part is more complicated than the others, so we describe it more too.
    2.1- We have a username, for ex. ?testuser? for a site like ?testuser.com?
    2.2- Login by "testuser" and its password.
 2.3- Find Hosting Controller setup directory as we wrote it in part 11. (default directory is ?C:\Program Files\Advanced Communications\Hosting Controller\web\admin\?)
    2.4- Find ?testuser.com? IIS username by uploading a file or by seeing all system user (part 10) or by your experience (username for ?testuser.com? is always like ?testusercom_web? )
    2.5- Drag & drop "SetPermission.htm" to your current browser's window (that is logged in Hosting Controller) and fill it.
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~2.5.1 SetPermission.htm~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            <pre>
            This file set full permission on "DB" directory of "forum"
            So you can upload your file there and execute your command with administrator permission.
            </pre>
            <script language="javascript">

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    2.6- If you see ?Error: 70500170 : User already exists in either OS or Database.? Means that all the thing are OK!, and your permission has already set.
    2.7- Now you have a full access to "[HCPATH]\Forum\DB".
     Note: You can do that with "[HCPATH]\phpBB\phpBB\db" too because there is "db" directory too.
   2.8- So you can upload your command executer there, but you need a file uploader at first on "testuser.com" to upload your command executer on "[HCPATH]\Forum\DB".
 2.9- If your permission has not been set correctly, its always because of limitation on making a new user. So you must login with username's reseller and make a new plan with making some new user accounts permission then sell it to your username. Also, you can increase your credit amount (part 6) and buy a plan with a lot of web accounts then select it and do these operation from the first. (Note: This vulnerability works properly and there is no exception like the others!)

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
/////////////////////

15- [User] can change other's host headers.
 15.1- This is because of "/IIS/iibind.asp" which accept the parameter without any checking. Also, this file has potential for dangerous SQL Injection.

####################
- Solution:
####################

Unfortunately, there is no support from hosting controller about these bugs. Also, they told us that there is no more support for HC 6.1.
Fast Solution:
Delete or rename these files which are in "Hosting Controller\web\admin\":
- "/hosting/addreseller.asp"
- "/Accounts/AccountActions.asp"
- "/hosting/addsubsite.asp"
- "/hosting/xml_addresellerresult.asp"
- "/accounts/accountmanager.asp"
- "/fp2002/UNINSTAL.asp"
- "/OpenApi/GatewayVariables.asp"
- "/fp2000/NEWSRVR.asp"
- "/hosting/importhostingplans.asp"
- "/hosting/AutoSignUpPlans.asp"
- "/forum/HCSpecific/DisableForum.asp"
- "/forum/HCSpecific/EnableForum.asp"
- "/IIS/iibind.asp"

Also, you can contact "admin[4t}bugreport{d0t]ir" to fix all these bugs for you without changing or deleting any file if you want.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
