- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `index.php` script of the "project alumni" application. Specifically, the `$_GET['act']` parameter is directly used in an `include` statement without validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is a **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** vulnerability. The application directly includes files based on user-supplied input, which allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By exploiting the LFI vulnerability, an attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`, potentially leading to information disclosure and further compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests. The attacker manipulates the `act` parameter of `index.php` to specify a path to a file they wish to include.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special privileges or specific network positions are required.

The provided exploit URL `http://victim/path/index.php?act=../../../../../../etc/passwd%00` demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability, using path traversal (`../`) to navigate to the `/etc/passwd` file. The null byte `%00` is used to terminate the path, which may be necessary depending on the system configuration.
