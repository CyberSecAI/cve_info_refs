```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly verify the input passed to the \"id\" parameter in the profiles-codes, video-codes, and arcade-games modules before using it in SQL queries.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to extract sensitive information like user IDs, usernames, password hashes, and email addresses from the database. In some cases, it could lead to system access through techniques like reading the /etc/passwd file (if the web server has the required privileges).",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a web browser by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the URL of the vulnerable modules.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The magic_quotes setting in php.ini must be off for successful exploitation. No prior authentication is required for exploitation."
