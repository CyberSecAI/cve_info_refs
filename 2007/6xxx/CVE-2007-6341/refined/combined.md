Package        : libnet-dns-perl
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-3377 CVE-2007-3409 CVE-2007-6341
Debian Bug     : 457445

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in libnet-dns-perl.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

It was discovered that libnet-dns-perl generates very weak transaction
IDs when sending queries (CVE-2007-3377).  This update switches
transaction ID generation to the Perl random generator, making
prediction attacks more difficult.

Compression loops in domain names resulted in an infinite loop in the
domain name expander written in Perl (CVE-2007-3409).  The Debian
package uses an expander written in C by default, but this vulnerability
has been addressed nevertheless.

Decoding malformed A records could lead to a crash (via an uncaught
Perl exception) of certain applications using libnet-dns-perl
(CVE-2007-6341).

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.59-1etch1.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.48-1sarge1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libnet-dns-perl package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you

Revision history for Net::DNS
=============================

*** 0.63, 8 Feb 2008

This version contains a Security Fix.

Feature NotifyHandler in Nameserver

  The NotifyHandler is a new attribute to the nameserver used in the
  same way as the ReplyHandler except that it is executed when the
  opcode is NS_NOTIFY (RFC1996). It takes the same arguments as the
  reply handler (i.e. $qname, $qclass, $qtype, $peerhost, and $query).
  Corrections made in the documentation.

Fix rt.cpan.org #32937: 5.11 introduces new warning on uc(undef)

  The patch supplied fixes for methods where undefined arguments were
  likely. For methods where undefined arguments don't make the warning
  will be printed.

Fix rt.cpan.org #32147: Default LocalAddr broken in Net::DNS::Nameserver 0.62

  Listen on the default address if LocalAddr not defined.

Fix rt.cpan.org #30316  Security issue with Net::DNS Resolver.

  Net/DNS/RR/A.pm in Net::DNS 0.60 build 654 allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (program "croak") via a crafted DNS
  response (http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-6341). Packet
  parsing routines are now enclosed in eval blocks to trap exception
  and avoid premature termination of user program.

Bug: mbox-dname and txt-dname were not allowed to be empty in the RP RR.
   Fix by Peter Koch

*** 0.62, 28 December 2007

Features: Move of some functionality out of the Packet to the Question
   and RR classes; parsing of elements in the packet is now performed
   by calling the appropriate subclasses.

   New methods were introduced:
   * Net::DNS::Packet->parse()
   * Net::DNS::RR->parse()
   * Net::DNS::Question->parse()

   The Packet class now defers parsing of authority/additional until
   their content is really needed. This should cause a bit of
   performance improvement.

   Dick Franks is acknowledged for this Good Work (TM).

Feature: the Net::DNS::Packet's answersize() method will from now on
    ignore its arguments and just return the size of the packet.

Feature: The Net::DNS::RR->new() method used to call
    Net::DNS::RR->new_from_data() whenever called with the appropriate
    combination of arguments. That (undocumented) behavior has been deprecated.
    Use Net::DNS::RR->new_from_data() directly if you depended on that.

Feature: Net::DNS::Packets unique_push now ignores the TTL in
    comparison of uniqueness, this is closer to the intend of
    RFC2181, but not yet fully compliant.

Fix rt.cpan.org #29816
    Acquiring the IP address for the Resolver under Cygwin is made
    more resilient.

Fix rt.cpan.org #31425
    Empty question section in Base.pm search method detected

Fix rt.cpan.org #31042
    Makefile corrected to add a library target.

Fix rt.cpan.org #29818
    10-recurse.t used to fail in very specific environment (where a query for
    qname="." and qtype="NS" would return with an empty additional section).
    Fixed by adding the hints explicitly; this also forces the tests to take
    place under the root served by a-m.root-servers.net

Fix rt.cpan.org #29877
    Made 00-version.t recognize a "GIT" environment.

Fix rt.cpan.org #29878

   SPF.pm did not evaluate as true. Thanks Bjorn Hansen.

Fix rt.cpan.org #21398
   answersize() and answerfrom() set for persistent sockets

Fix rt.cpan.org #29883
   Fix various tests only available through SVN, so they are
   more robust (Acknowledgements Bjoern Hansen)

Fix rt.cpan.org #24343
   Resolver's nameserver() method would do silly things with undefined
   arguments.

Fix rt.cpan.org #29531
   Nameserver.pm, Packet.pm and Question.pm modified to avoid erroneous PTR
   lookup in response to mischievous query packet containing an IP address.

Fix rt.cpan.org #27970 better netdns.o

    Marek Rouchal provided two minor improvements for linking the C
    code sniplets

Fix rt.cpan 28345

    A fix in Test::Simple revealed an off by 1 error in the testplan
    for 05-rr-rrsort.t. The fix is to remove a test, creating a dependency
    on Test::Simple 0.71 seemed overkill.

*** 0.61, 1 August 2007

Fix rt.cpan.org #28106, 28198, and 28590
    Modification of $_ in various places.

Fix
    t/11-inet6 assumed lowercase domain names.

*** 0.60 20 June 2007

Fix spelling mistakes in change log using interactive spell checker (aspell).

Fix
    Two redundant calls of $self->rdatastr() in Net::DNS::RR::string().

Fix rt.cpan.org #27285 bis
    Unreleased 0.59_1 dn_expand_PP() has security flaw allowing access to
    arbitrary data using crafted packet with out of range compression pointer.
    Patch by Dick Franks based on 0.59 code.

Fix rt.cpan.org #27391
    dn_compress() produces corrupt packet for name containing empty label.

Fix rt.cpan.org #26957
    dn_compress() croaks for name having label which exceeds 63 characters.
    Patch by Dick Franks truncates offending label.

Feature check_soa test of NCACHE TTL
    Dick Franks supplied an improved version of check_soa script which
    performs a direct test of NCACHE TTL by looking up non-existent name and
    reporting value if it exceeds 86400. Test is skipped unless minimumTTL is
    above same threshold.  Recent BIND implementations impose a ceiling on
    NCACHE TTLs internally, so a large minimumTTL value is unlikely to have
    damaging consequences at many sites.

Fix rt.cpan.org #27285
    Break out of malformed packets with compression loops.
    Steffen Ullrich is acknowledged for patch and test code.

Feature check_zone "alternate domain" and "exception file" flags
    Paul Archer supplied a patch for check_zone adding two new features.

Feature Support for IPSECKEY RR
    Rudimentary IPSECKEY RR support added.

Fix rt.cpan.org  #25342
    HINFO would only accept its data fields within quotes. That has now
    been fixed to adhere to <character-string> by inheriting parsing functions
    from TXT.

Fix rt.cpan.org #24631 / Feature IP address prefix notation
    Dick Franks supplied a cleaned up version of Question.pm.

    Revised code deals with incomplete IPv6 address bug and accepts RFC4291
    address prefix notation. IPv4/prefix also supported for completeness.

    This involved a minor change to the API for reverse IP lookup.  Changing
    qtype to PTR is now performed for A and AAAA only.  This allows queries
    for NS and SOA records at interior nodes to be specified using the address
    prefix.  Type ANY queries now also produce the expected result.

    Cleaned up TYPE/CLASS reversal code, exploiting fact that the intersection
    of the sets of class and type names contains only one member (ANY).

    Minor cleanup of remaining code.

Fix rt.cpan.org #22019

    Expunge trailing dots from RR->new_from_hash() FQDN arguments.
    Patch by Dick Franks.

Fix Recursion and EDNS OPT record

    The Recursive resolver process would add an OPT-RR with each recursion
    which causes FORMERRs with a number of authoritative servers.

Feature SSHFP warn instead of die

    We do not die if a not implemented fingerprint type value is read
    from the wire, instead we 'warn' and return undef.

Feature NSEC3PARAM hook

    A hook to load NSEC3PARAM when available has been added.
    WARNING: Both NSEC3 and NSEC3PARAM are configured with their
    experimental type codes.

Feature rt r24525

    Net::DNS::Resolver depended on Net::IP (2268 Kb) which depends on
    heavy module Math::BigInt (1780 Kb). Valery Studennikov suggested to
    ship Net::DNS::Resolver::Base with its own copies of ip_is_ipv[4|6] and
    supplied a patch with those functions stripped from Net::IP.

    Note that the package still depends on Net::IP because
    Net::DNS::Nameserver and a few tests depend on it.

Fix rt 22334
    Fixed "perl Makefile.PL --xs" behavior, patch by Tamas Palfalvi

Fix rt 21752 and 24042
    Applied the patch supplied by Alexandr Ciornii to be able
    to compile on ActiveState perl .
    Slight modifications based on comments by nimnul

Fix rt 23961
    Randomized the ID on the queries. Thanks to "hjp" for reporting and
    suggesting a fix.

    The randomization of the src port is supposed to be handled by the
    setting the source port to "0" (default). Overriding the default
    or using persistent sockets may be problematic.

    Also see:
    http://www.potaroo.net/ietf/idref/draft-hubert-dns-anti-spoofing/

Fix
    Minor compile time warnings for netdns.c on Fedora Core.

*** 0.59 September 18, 2006

Fix rt.cpan.org 20836, 20857, 20994, and 21402

    These tickets all revolved around proper reverse mapping of IPv6
    addresses.

    Acknowledgments to Dick Franks who has provided elegant solutions and
    cleaned a bit of code.

    Note that directly calling Question->new() without arguments will
    cause the qclass,qtype to be IN, A instead of ANY, ANY.

    Net::DNS::Resolver's search() method would always gracefully
    interpret a qname in the form of an IPv4 address. It would go out
    and do a PTR query in the reverse address tree. This behavior has
    also been applied to IPv6 addresses in their many shapes and
    forms.

    This change did two things, 1) root zone not implicitly added to
    search list when looking up short name, 2) default domain appended
    to short name if DEFNAMES and not DNSRCH.

Fix rt.cpan.org 18113

   Minor error due to unapplied part of patch fixed.

Feature: Experimental NSEC3 hooks.

   Net::DNS::typesbyval() now confesses on undefined
   args. Acknowledgments to Dean Serenevy.

Feature Implemented SPF (typecode 99).

   The class completely inherits from Net::DNS::RR::TXT (the easiest
   RR to implement ever).

Feature added rrsort() function.
   Feature was requested by Eric Hall in rt.cpan.org 13392

   This was a little tricky as I think that the sort functions are in
   fact RR specific class attributes that should be accessed through
   class methods. This is difficult to implement. I do think I found a
   fairly clean manner. It does require a global variable in Net::DNS
   to store the functions and some trickery when the sorting functions
   are defined.

   See Net::DNS and Net::DNS::RR documentation for details.

   Defaults sorting functions are currently implemented in
      SRV: default sort: low priority to high priority and for
           same preference highest weight first.
	   weight: sort all RRs based on weight, highest first
	   priority: see default sort

      MX:  default sort: lowest preference first.
           preference: see default sort

    NAPTR: default sort: lowest to highest order, for same order lowest
           preference first

   TCP fallback after V6 socket failure

   Reworked Net::DNS::Base::Nameserver::send_tcp() to fallback to IPv4 when
   possible. (change applied to SVN Revision 538).

Feature Cleanup duplicated code

   axfr_send() and send_tcp() contained some duplicated code. I merged
   this in one "helper" method _create_tcp_socket()

Fix AXFR persistent sockets colliding with query sockets.

   I think that using the same persistent sockets for AXFR and
   'ordinary' queries could lead to race conditions. Better safe than
   sorry. For axfrs we create a different set of persistent sockets.

   Note that this prevents performing a SOA query first and then using
   the same socket for the zone transfer itself(in Net::DNS these are
   different code paths). This behavior of SOA and transfer on the
   same socket-- seems to be suggested by 1035 section 4.2.2:

     "In particular, the server should allow the SOA and AXFR request
     sequence (which begins a refresh operation) to be made on a
     single connection."

   Obviously, on the client side this behavior is not mandatory.

Fix rt.cpan.org 17596

    The fixes and features above also fixed the timeout problem reported by
    Paul Hofman

 Profiling

    It turned out that each time we were calling
    Net::DNS::Resolver::Base::nameserver(); We were creating a
    resolver object. Now a resolver object is only called when a
    domain name is given as argument.

Fix rt.cpan.org 11931

  Using Net-DNS 0.53 on Win XP, it is unable to retrieve the
  nameservers when the IP address of the interface is assigned by
  DHCP.  This is due to the DHCP assigned IP address being stored in
  DhcpIPAddress rather than IPAddress (which is then 0.0.0.0).  Adding
  a check of DhcpIPAddress existence and not being 0.0.0.0 fixes the

Fix rt.cpan.org 14046

  RRSIGs verify and create failed for a number of RR types. The
  error message showed something like:
      Can't call method "dn_comp" on an undefined value
  This was caused by an omission in the _canonicalRdata() method
  in Net::DNS::RR that was inherited by all failing RR types.

  Code was added to t/05-rr.t that will test signature creation
  if Net::DNS::SEC is available and can be loaded.

Feature async nameserver behaviour.

   In rt.cpan.org 14622 Robert Stone suggested:

      The fact that it needs to take over the main running thread
      limits its audience.  Since many daemon programs are already
      driven by a top level select loop, it seems useful to provide an
      API for the user to integrate Net::DNS::Nameserver processing to
      their own select loop.

   He also supplied example code for which he is hereby acknowledged.
   The patch was not used because simultaneously Robert Martin-Legène
   supplied a patch to Nameservers.pm that allowed the same async
   functionality through the use of loop_once method. Robert M-L's
   code also carefully manages the TCP sockets, so that they can
   deal with AXFRs.

   Robert S. has been so kind to review Robert M-L's code and is hereby
   kindly acknowledged.

   NB. Since the code may be subject to change the documentation of the
   loop_once method has been commented out.

    It should be noted that for perl versions < 5.006 I had to disable

Fix:
      Concatenation of scalars caused modification of data because of
      Perl's habit to treat scalars as utf characters instead of bytes.
      Inserted use bytes pragma throughout the code base. DNS is done

Feature:

      (e.g. www,nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/210570)
      I worked around that by moving the library into the base
      directory of the distribution as the "subdir" section
      seemed to be all funny.

Fix: rt.cpan.org#11931 (the off-topic part)

      Sidney Markowitz spotted an awkward condition that rarely happens but is
      significant enough to be dealt with.

      In the send_udp method there are two loops: one over the nameservers
      and one that waits for the sockets to come forward with data.

      That second loop will sometimes timeout and then be entered with a
      repeated query to the same nameserver. It occasionally happens that the
      old packet arrives on the socket. That packet is discarded but the
      loop does not return to the loop to wait for the remainder of the
      timeout period for an answer on the second query, that may still arrive.
      This has now been fixed.

      Thanks to Sidney for the assessment of the problem and the fix.

*** 0.49_01    (Version 0.50 release candidate 1)

Fix: Makefile.PL: Minor tweak to recognize Mac OS X 10.4 not so relevant
    since netdnslib is distributed with the code.

Feature: Calling the Net::DNS::Resolver::dnssec method with a non-zero
    argument will set the udppacketsize to 2048. The method will
    also carp a warning if you pass a non-zero argument when
    Net::DNS::SEC is not installed.

Feature: IPv6 transport support

     IPv6 transport has been added to the resolver and to the
     nameserver code.

     To use IPv6 please make sure that you have IO::Socket::INET6 version
     2.01 or later installed.

     If IPv6 transport is available Net::DNS::Resolver::Recurse will make
     use of it (picking randomly between IPv4 and IPv6 transport) use
     the force_v4() method to only force IPv4.

Feature: Binary characters in labels

     RFC 1035 3.1:

       Domain names in messages are expressed in terms of a sequence of
       labels.  Each label is represented as a one octet length field
       followed by that number of octets.  Since every domain name ends
       with the null label of the root, a domain name is terminated by a
       length byte of zero.  The high order two bits of every length octet
       must be zero, and the remaining six bits of the length field limit
       the label to 63 octets or less.

     Unfortunately dname attributes are stored strings throughout
     Net::DNS.  (With hindsight dnames should have had their own class
     in which one could have preserved the wire format.).

     To be able to represent all octets that are allowed in domain
     names I took the approach to use the "presentation format" for
     the attributes. This presentation format is defined in RFC 1035
     5.1.

     I added code to parse presentation format domain names that has
     escaped data such as \ddd and \X (where X is not a number) to
     wireformat and vice verse. In the conversion from wire format to
     presentation format the characters that have special meaning in a
     zone file are escaped (so that they can be cut-n-pasted without
     pain).

     These are " (0x22), $ (0x24), (0x28), ) (0x29), . (0x2e) , ;
     (0x3b), @ (ox40) and \ (0x5c). The number between brackets
     representing the ascii code in hex.

     Note that wherever a name occurs as a string in Net::DNS it is
     now in presentation format.

     For those that dealt with 'hostnames' (subset of all possible
     domain names) this will be a completely transparent change.

     Details:

     I added netdnslib which contains Net::DNS's own dn_expand. Its
     implemented in C and the source is a hodgepodge of Berkeley based
     code and snippets from ISC's bind9 distribution. The behavior, in
     terms of which chars are escaped, is similar to bind9.

     There are some functions added to DNS.pm that do conversion from
     presentation and wire format and back. They should only be used
     internally (although they live in EXPORT_OK.)

     For esoteric test cases see t/11-escapedchars.t.

      TXT records don't work with semicolons

      Since we are expecting presentation format at input a comment
      will need to be escaped ( \; ).

      It could be argued that this is a to strict interpretation of
      1035 section 5.1.

      While working on this I discovered there are more problems with
      TXT RRs. e.g.; '0100' (a character string content represented in
      hex) is a perfectly legal and should be represented as "\000" in
      presentation format. Net::DNS does pass character strings with
      "non-ASCII" chars from the wire to the char_str_lst array but
      the print functions do not properly escape them when printing.

      Some tests with TXT RRs added to 07-misc.t

*** 0.47_01 May 6, 2004

** NOTICE **

RR subclasses no longer pull in parts of Net::DNS; Net::DNS is assumed
to be up and running when the subclass is compiled.  If you were using a
RR subclass directly, this may break your code.  It was never documented
that you could use them directly however, so hopefully you never did...

Fixed bug where SRV records with a priority of 0 did not function
correctly.  CPAN #6214

Calls to various constants where using the &NAME syntax, which is not
inlined.  Changed to NAME().

Added SSHFP support. [Olaf]

CERT fixes.  [Olaf]

*** 0.47 April 1, 2004

safe_push() is back in Net::DNS::Packet, due to the excellent debate
skills of Luis E Monoz.  However, the name safe_push() is deprecated,
use the new name unique_push() instead.

Fixed a bug in Net::DNS::Nameserver which caused the class to build
packets incorrectly in some cases. [Ask Bjorn Hansen]

Error message cleanups in Net::DNS::typesbyname()
and Net::DNS::typesbyval() [Ask Bjorn Hansen]

Net::DNS::RR::new_from_hash() now works with unknown RR types [Olaf].

*** 0.46 February 21, 2004

IPv6 reverse lookups can now be done with Net::DNS::Resolver::search(),
as well as with query().

Hostnames can now be used in the 'nameservers' argument to
Net::DNS::Resolver->new()

*** 0.45_01 February 9, 2004

Net::DNS now uses UDP on windows.

Removed Net::DNS::Select from the package.  IO::Select appears to work
on windows just fine.

Fixed a bug that caused MXes with a preference of 0 to function
incorrectly, reported by Dick Franks.

Net::DNS had a few problems running under taint mode, especially under
cygwin.  These issues have been fixed.  More issues with taint mode may
lay undiscovered.

Applied Matthew Darwin's patch added support for IPv6 reverse lookups to
Net::DNS::Resolver::query.

*** 0.45 January 8, 2004

No changes from 0.44_02.

** 0.44_02 January 3, 2004

The XS detection code was broken.  We actually use the XS bits now.

Major cleanups/optimizations of the various RR subclasses.  This release
of Net::DNS is over twice as fast at parsing dns packets as 0.44.

** NOTICE **

$rr->rdatastr no longer returns '; no data' if the RR record has no
data.  This happens in $rr->string now.

Net::DNS::Packet::safe_push() no longer exists.  The method is now only
available from Net::DNS::Update objects.

** 0.44_01 January 3, 2004

Net::DNS::RR objects were not playing nice with Storable, this caused
the axfr demo script to fail.  Thanks to Joe Dial for the report.

** NOTICE **
This may cause RR objects that are already serialize to not deserialize
correctly.

Reply handlers in Net::DNS::Nameserver are now passed the query object.

Fixed a nasty bug in Nameserver.pm related to the qr bit.  As Olaf
explained:

  Replies are sent if the query has its "qr" bit set. The "qr" bit is an
  indication that the packet is sent as a response to a query. Since
  there are more implementations that suffer from this bug one can cause
  all kinds of nasty ping-pong loops by spoofing the initial packet or
  have an infinite query loop by spoofing a query from the localhost:53
  address.

Various Win32/Cygwin cleanups from Sidney Markowitz.

*** 0.44 December 12, 2003

	The Wrath of CPAN Release.

CPAN.pm doesn't understand the nature of revision numbers.  1.10 is
newer than 1.9; but CPAN.pm treats them as floats.  This is bad.
All the internal version numbers in Net::DNS have been bumped to
2.100 in order to fix this.

No actual code changes in this release.

*** 0.43 December 11, 2003

Added warning of deprecation of Net::DNS::Packet::safe_push.  This will
move into Net::DNS::Update, as Net::DNS::Update is now a proper subclass
of Net::DNS::Packet.

** 0.42_02 December 11, 2003

Fixed a long standing bug with zone transfers in the "many-answers" format.
CPAN #1903.

Added the '--online-tests' flag to Makefile.PL.  This activates the online
tests without asking the user interactively.  "--no-online-tests" turns
the tests off.

Cleaned up Makefile.PL a little.  The "--pm" flag is now deprecated, use
"--no-xs" instead.

Added support for unknown RR types (rfc3597). Note for developers: the
typesbyname, typesbyval, classesbyname and classesbyval hashes should
not be used directly, use the same named wrapper functions
instead. [Olaf Kolkman]

Added two hashes for administrative use; they store which types are
qtypes and metatypes (rfc2929). [Olaf Kolkman]

** 0.42_01 November 30, 2003

Major work to get Net::DNS functioning properly on Cygwin by Sidney
Markowitz.

Fixed a bug in Net::DNS::Nameserver's error handling.  CPAN #4195

*** 0.42 October 26, 2003

Fixed compilation problems on panther (Mac OS 10.3).

Fixed a bug in Net::DNS::Resolver::Recurse which allowed an endless
loop to arise in certain situations.  (cpan #3969, patch
by Rob Brown)

Applied Mike Mitchell's patch implementing a persistent UDP socket.
See the Net::DNS::Resolver documentation for details.

*** 0.41 October 3, 2003

Added some documentation about modifying the behavior of Net::DNS::Resolver.

** 0.40_01 September 26, 2003

Fixed some uninitialized value warnings when running under windows.

Fixed a bug in the test suite that caused 00-version.t to fail with
certain versions of ExtUtils::MakeMaker.   Thanks to David James, Jos
Boumans and others for reporting it.

Reply handlers in Net::DNS::Nameserver are now passed the peerhost.
(Assen Totin <assen@online.bg>)

Reply handlers in Net::DNS::Nameserver can now tweak the header bits
that the nameserver returns.  [Olaf]

The AD header bit is now documented, and twiddlable. [Olaf]

The change log has been trimmed, entries for versions older than 0.21
have been removed.

** NOTICE **
Net::DNS::Resolver::axfr_old() has been removed from the package.
An exception will be thrown if you attempt to use this method.  Use
axfr() or axfr_start() instead.

*** 0.40 September 1, 2003

Various POD tweaks.

** 0.39_02 August 28, 2003

Net-DNS-SEC updates, seems that IETF has been busy redefining DNSSEC.
[Olaf]

Added version to all the modules in the distribution.

** 0.39_01 August 12 2003

Added a META.yaml.  The crystal ball says an upgrade to Module::Install may
be coming soon.

Changed how the versions of the various submodules were set.  The CPAN
indexer cannot execute "$VERSION = $Net::DNS::VERSION".  The single line
with the $VERSION assignment is pulled out of the file and eval'ed; at
that time, Net::DNS is not loaded.  The submodules now pull their version
numbers out of CVS.

*** 0.39 August 7 2003

Fixed a bug on Win32 where some machines separated lists with commas,
not whitespace.  Thanks to Jim White for pointing it out.

** 0.38_02 July 29 2003

Reworked the POD for Net::DNS::Resolver.

When parsing resolver configuration files, IPv6 addresses are now skipped,
as Net::DNS does not yet have IPv6 support.

** 0.38_01 Jun 22 2003

Broke Net::DNS::Resolver into separate classes.  UNIX and Win32
classes are currently implemented.  Many of the globals in
Net::DNS::Resolver no longer exist.  They were never documented
so you never used them.... right?

Options to Net::DNS::Resolver->new() are now supported, including
using your own configuration file.  See the Net::DNS::Resolver man
page for details.

Tweaked Net::DNS::RR::TXT to fail more gracefully when the quotes
in the data section are not balanced.

Add more tests (of course).

Moved next_id() from Resolver.pm to Header.pm (which is where it is
used).

Net::DNS::Select now uses $^O directly, this means that the second
argument to Net::DNS::Select::new() (the OS) is now ignored.

*** 0.38 Jun 5 2003

Various buglets fixed in the new Makefile.PL.

Use Dynaloader instead of XSLoader.  Turns out that XSLoader is only
in more recent perls.

Added deprecation warning to Net::DNS::Resolver::axfr_old().

HP-UX fixes [cpan #2710], I don't have the name of the reporter/patcher.

*** 0.37 May 28 2003

Renamed the test C file to compile.c, test.c was confusing the 'make test'
target.

*** 0.36 May 28 2003

Removed Rob Brown's RPM stuff.  Something odd happened in the 0.35 tarball
and at the moment I don't have the time to investigate.

*** 0.35 May 26 2003

POD fixes, added tests for POD.

*** 0.34_03 May 22 2003

Reworked Makefile.PL to try and detect if you have a working C compiler.

Added '--pm' and '--xs' command line options to Makefile.PL

Fixed linking problem on linux.

Tie::DNSHash removed from the package, see Tie::DNS from CPAN for a more
complete implementation of a DNS hash.

*** 0.34_02 May 21 2003

Net::DNS::Packet::dn_expand is now implemented using the function of the
same name from libresolv.  This method of decompressing names is around
twice as fast as the perl implementation.

Applied Jan Dubois's patch to fix nameserver lookup on Windows 2000/95/98/ME.

*** 0.34 6 Mar 2003

Applied David Carmean's patch for handling more than one string in a
TXT RR's RDATA section.

Applied Net::DNS::Resolver::Recurse bug fixes from Rob Brown.

Added check of the answer's rcode in Net::DNS::Resolver::axfr_next().

Applied Kenneth Olving <kenneth.olving@eoncompany.com> Windows changes.

Applied patch from Dan Sully (daniel@electricrain.com) allowing multiple
questions to be part of a DNS packet.

*** 0.33 8 Jan 2003

Fixed 00-load.t to skip the Net::DNS::SEC modules.  The test suite
should now pass if you have Net::DNS::SEC installed.

Fixed the regular expression in RR.pm to comply with the RFCs, turns
out we were _too_ paranoid.  [Olaf]

*** 0.32 5 Jan 2003

Various cleanups for perl 5.004.  Thanks to nathan@anderson-net.com
([cpan #1847])

Applied Olaf's SIG patch (thanks as always).

Win32 now looks at the environment variables when building the
configuration defaults.  Thanks to net-dns-bug@oak-wood.co.uk
(That's the only name I have... [cpan #1819])

Added Rob Brown's Net::DNS::Resolver::Recurse module.

*** 0.31 17 Nov 2002

Applied Olaf's patch for an initialization bug in OPT.pm

Applied Rob Brown's patch for udp timeouts.

Added stuff from Rob Brown for making RPM creation easier.

Fixed a typo in FAQ.pod that was making apropos and whatis
grumpy.  Thanks to Florian Hinzmann for pointing it out and a patch.

*** 0.30 7 Nov 2002

Applied Andrew Tridgell's (tridge@samba.org) patch for TKEY support.

Added Net::DNS::Packet->safe_push() to allow for automatically
checking for duplicate RRs being pushed into a packet.  Inspired by Luis
Munoz.

Added more tests.

*** 0.29 2 Oct 2002

Fixed $_ from creeping out of scope in Resolver.pm. Thanks to
Ilya Martynov for finding the problem and the patch to fix it.

Fixed divide by zero bug there is no usable network interface(s).
Thanks to twilliams@tfcci.com, misiek@pld.ORG.PL (and one other
person that I can't seem to find the address of) for reports.

*** 0.28 20 Aug 2002

Fixed a bug in the new AUTOLOAD routines that made it impossible to set
attributes to '0'.

Fixed a bug in the RR patch that broke many updates.

*** 0.27 15 Aug 2002

Added (untested) support for perl 5.004.

We now allow whitespace at the beginning of a RR.

Fixed an issue that gave Net::DNS::SEC problems, %Net::DNS::RR::RR is now
in a scope that the Net::DNS::SEC hook can see it from.

Fixed SRV records.

Fixed debug message in Net::DNS::Resolver::bgread().

*** 0.26 5 Aug 2002

Fixed various bugs in the test suite.

Fixed warning in Net::DNS::RR::AUTOLOAD with perl 5.005.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.
