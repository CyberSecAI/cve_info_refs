Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** SQL Injection vulnerability in the `active.asp` file of Snitz Forums 2000.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The `BuildTime` parameter in `active.asp` is vulnerable to SQL injection. The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `BuildTime` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially allowing them to gain administrator level privileges by modifying the `M_Level` field in the database. This grants them full access to the forum.
*  **Attack Vectors:**  The attacker sends an HTTP POST request to `active.asp` with a crafted `BuildTime` parameter containing SQL injection code. This can be done via a simple HTML form.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the forum. They do not need any special privileges other than a valid user account. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a SQL Injection in the `active.asp` file of Snitz Forums 2000. By sending a crafted POST request, an attacker can inject SQL code through the `BuildTime` parameter to elevate their privileges to administrator.
