      "summary": "The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) in Mcms Easy Web Make. The vulnerable code is within `index.php`, where the `template` parameter is used to include files. The vulnerability exists when `magic_quotes_gpc` is off. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the `template` parameter, using a path to a local file, to include arbitrary files on the server, by injecting a null byte `%00` to bypass any file extension checks. The vulnerable code is: `include\"includes/$template/template.config.php\";`"
