**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Flat PHP Board application does not properly filter user-supplied input in several areas, including user registration, profile updates, and handling of topic and viewprofile parameters. This lack of sanitization allows for various injection and manipulation attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Remote User Credentials Disclosure:** Usernames, passwords, and emails can be exposed by directly accessing user profile files (e.g., `users/[target_username].php`).
*   **Multiple Remote Command Executions / File Uploading:** Unfiltered input during user registration (specifically username, password, and email fields), allows injection of malicious code.  This results in arbitrary PHP code execution and file upload by creating a specially crafted user profile file. The profile update functionality is similarly affected
*   **Remote Directory Traversal / Source Disclosure:** By manipulating the `topic` and `username` parameters in `index.php`, attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, including PHP source code.
*   **Remote Cookie Manipulation / Privilege Escalation:** Manipulating the `fpb_username` cookie allows an attacker to impersonate another user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Exposure of user credentials including usernames, passwords, and email addresses.
*   Remote execution of arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   Disclosure of sensitive server-side source code.
*   Privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain control over the accounts of other users.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Direct access to user profile files via HTTP.
*   Manipulated form submissions, such as during user registration or profile updates.
*   Manipulated GET parameters in URLs, allowing for directory traversal and file inclusion.
*   Modification of client-side cookies.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and manipulate the cookies.
*   The attacker needs to be able to register a user account, in order to leverage the code injection vulnerabilities.
