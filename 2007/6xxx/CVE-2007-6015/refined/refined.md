Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2007-6015 from the provided documents:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `send_mailslot()` function of Samba.
*   The vulnerability stems from improper processing of `SAMLOGON` packets. Specifically, a boundary checking error in the `send_mailslot()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Buffer overflow:**  The `send_mailslot()` function does not correctly handle the size of incoming `SAMLOGON` packets, particularly the `GETDC` string.
*   **Improper input validation:** The software doesn't properly validate the size of the username string within the SAMLOGON packets, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
*   **Odd offset vulnerability:** A specially crafted SAMLOGON packet with an empty username at an odd offset will cause the subsequent string to be processed incorrectly.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Samba server.
*   **Denial of Service:** Exploitation can cause the Samba service to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the network.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to send a specially crafted `SAMLOGON` domain logon packet.
*   The vulnerability requires that domain logon support is enabled in Samba, but this is not the default configuration in Gentoo.
* The attacker needs network connectivity to the target.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a SAMLOGON domain logon packet with:
  * A username string placed at an odd offset (or an empty username at an odd offset).
  * A long GETDC string.
* The vulnerability stems from the way Samba converts the GETDC string into ascuser by using the pull_ucs2_pstring function after an empty username is placed at an odd offset. This allows a larger buffer overflow.
* This issue is present in samba versions prior to 3.0.28.
* The vulnerability exists in `nmbd` code, and specifically in the function `nmbd_packets.c` at line 1895 calling `set_message()` function which causes a stack overflow.

**Mitigation:**
*   Disable domain logon support.
*   Upgrade to the patched version of samba.

**Patched Versions:**
*   Samba version 3.0.28 (released by upstream)
*   Samba version 3.0.27a with patch applied

**Affected products (per content):**
*   HP-UX running HP CIFS Server (Samba) vA.02.03.02 or earlier on HP-UX B.11.11, B.11.23, and B.11.31.
*   Debian (etch - 3.0.24-6etch9, sarge - 3.0.14a-3sarge11).
*   Ubuntu (dapper - 3.0.22-1ubuntu3.6, gusty - 3.0.26a-1ubuntu2.3, feisty - 3.0.24-2ubuntu1.5, edgy - 3.0.22-1ubuntu4.5).
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux (various versions).
*   Slackware (10.0, 10.1, 10.2, 11.0, 12.0, and -current).
*   Gentoo (prior to 3.0.28).
* Avaya Messaging Storage Server and Avaya Message Networking prior to 3.1 SP1.

**CVSS Score:**
* CVSS Base Score is 9.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) according to the provided HP Security bulletin.
