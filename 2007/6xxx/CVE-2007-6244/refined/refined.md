{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Adobe Flash Player's asfunction protocol allows HTTP hyperlinks in Flash files to launch ActionScript functions, but this protocol was not properly restricted, leading to cross-site scripting issues.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
       "Improper Restriction of Security Bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to launch cross-site scripting attacks against sites that host vulnerable Flash files. This can lead to information disclosure and session hijacking by running arbitrary javascript in the security context of another domain.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker could host a malicious Flash file or inject it into a vulnerable website.",
        "User interaction is required. Target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create a malicious SWF file, or inject a malicious SWF file into a webpage or have the user open a malicious SWF file.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability specifically affects Flash Player 8 and Flash Player 9 and does not affect Flash Player 7. The vulnerability is triggered via the 'navigateToURL' API with a `javascript:` URI. This will execute in the context of the named frame, instead of that of the SWF or the parent page. The fix restricts the asfunction: protocol"
