How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.

# Opera: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200712-22**

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Opera, allowing for the
execution of arbitrary code and cross domain scripting.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/opera** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **9.25** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **9.25** |

### Background

Opera is a fast Web browser that is available free of charge.

### Description

David Bloom reported two vulnerabilities where plug-ins (CVE-2007-6520)
and Rich text editing (CVE-2007-6522) could be used to allow cross
domain scripting. Alexander Klink (Cynops GmbH) discovered an issue
with TLS certificates (CVE-2007-6521). Gynvael Coldwind reported that
bitmaps might reveal random data from memory (CVE-2007-6524).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities, possibly leading
to the execution of arbitrary code and cross domain scripting.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Opera users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/opera-9.25"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Graphics: ImageLib
▾

Core :: Graphics: ImageLib
ImageLib decodes GIF, JPEG and PNG images, and provides the decoded data to the Compositor for display. If Firefox or Seamonkey can display an image when loaded separately from the page, ImageLib is working, and the actual imaging bug exists elsewhere within Firefox or Seamonkey.

Examples of appropriate bugs: PNG gAMA chunk ignored; Crashes on GIF w/corrupted frame(merr-01.gif); or PNGs and JPEGs aren't displayed on FreeBSD.

Full credit goes to Michael Skladnikiewicz, who reported this to security@mozilla.org in an email with subject "Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.11, 3.0b2pre and prior Remote Information Disclosure". His initial email is quoted below.
-------------------------------------------
Hi,
(credit: Gynvael Coldwind // Vexillium with help from udevd and porneL
(I didn't know about <canvas> ;D))
OK, Here is how it goes.
Firefox has a problem in handling 8bit BMP files.
The BMP format has a field in the BITMAPINFOHEADER named biClrUsed, the
field says how many colors does the palette contain. If this field is 0,
then 256 color pallet is used. When this field is not 0, the palette has
the given number of colors.
Now this is how it goes in Firefox:
1. Firefox allocates 256 \* sizeof(RGB) for the palette
2. It copies the biClrUsed colors from the BMP file
Well, what is missing is:
1a. memset(pallete, 0, 256 \* sizeof(RGB)
The palette still contains old data from the heap.
Now, we take a BMP file sized 256x1x8 with biClrUser = 0, and fill the
bitmap with gradient, from 0 to 255:
00 01 02 03 04 05 ... and so on
When displayed, the BMP file looks chaotic, and in fact it contains the
palette copied to the screen.
Here is where HTML 5.0 comes in and <canvas>. You can imagine the
rest... But I'll write it anyway. You can create a HTML/javascript that
copies the image from img to a canvas and then gets it data and, for
example using a form, posts it to some remote server.
This has been tested and it works. There is a PoC exploit in the bottom.
The harvested data contains mainly trash, but there are also parts of
other websites, parts of java scripts, even parts of favorites. Well, if
there are also cookies and passwords in heap, then they are also reachable.
I've attached also the scripts and the leak.bmp bitmap.
This will be posted on bugtraq as soon as a fixed version of FireFox is
released.
Please check also Thunderbird for this issue (I didn't check).
Best regards,
Looking forward to Your reply,
Michael "Gynvael Coldwind" Skladnikiewicz

Follow-up email from Michael:
------------------------------------
Hello again,
Since I didn't receive any reply from You, I digged a little into the FF
code to provide You with additional information.
First of all, I was mistaking - it is not a missing memset function,
it's a boundary condition error.
In file mozilla\modules\libpr0n\decoders\bmp\nsBMPDecoder.cpp
Function ProcessData:
Line 260:
if (mBIH.bpp <= 8) {
mNumColors = 1 << mBIH.bpp;
if (mBIH.colors && mBIH.colors < mNumColors)
mNumColors = mBIH.colors;
mColors = new colorTable[mNumColors];
if (!mColors)
return NS\_ERROR\_OUT\_OF\_MEMORY;
}
Line 403:
case 8:
while (lpos > 0) {
SetPixel(d, \*p, mColors);
--lpos;
++p;
}
break;
There is a check missing - \*p should be checked against mNumColors.
In a malformed BMP file the \*p will be equal to or greater then
mNumColors, what causes one of two things:
1. Remote DoS - FF crashes when mColors[\*p] reaches over the Heap's end
(this happens mostly on Windows XP, it hasn't happen on Vista nor Linux)
2. Remote Information Disclosure (using <canvas> and javascript,
information from the heap residing after the mColors can be copied -
I've written you a mail about this).
Looking forward to your reply.
G.C.

I'm not really familiar with this code, but this patch seems to fix the bug. mNumColors is calculated based on either mBIH.bpp or mBIH.colors (which comes from the image), and then we never check whether the image data conforms to that range of colors. The only obvious way to do this was to do it in SetPixel as we're decoding the data - perhaps not optimal, but I don't see a better way.
This uses color at index 0 if the passed-in color is outside the range of mNumColors - that's probably still not safe, because it looks like mColors' initialization depends entirely on the image data which could again be corrupt. With the given test image the 0 color appears to be black, which matches what I see when I open the image in IE (IE doesn't fail to load the image).

This one just uses black (0,0,0) for invalid pixels, rather than relying on mColors. I suppose the question to answer is whether it's possible to produce a BMP file that doesn't initialize mColors (at <http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/modules/libpr0n/decoders/bmp/nsBMPDecoder.cpp&rev=1.37&mark=303-327#303> ) - if it is, then there's still the possibility of reading uninitialized memory, even with this patch. Hoping someone who knows more can comment.

The patch itself looks good.
There is no way to not have mColors uninitialized in the range 0 < mNumColors, as the parser always reads 3\*mNumColors bytes from the image data.
But there could be an easier way to safeguard this:
1. Allocate always a mColors table for 8-bit, so with 256 entries, even if mNumColors < 256
2. To always clear the whole table to 0 (using memset(mColors, 0, 256\*sizeof(colorTable))
In this way the SetPixel doesn't need to check the boundary (as Idx is a PRUint8 and thus always between 0 and 255)

Hi,
Imho Alfred Kayser's idea would be better (faster, and still safe).
However, Gavin Sharp's patch is still correct, it fixes the issue.

The ICO decoder doesn't have this bug because it always uses the maximum value for mNumColors based on mBIH.bpp.

| --- | --- | --- |

|  | |

Actually this patch won't fix the reported problem completely.
In the current code mNumColors is set to "1 << mBIH.bpp",
assuming that the color table is large enough to cover all possible pixel values for resp. 1, 4 and 8 bpp (note that MSDN also says that the colormap could be used for bpp's 16 and 32...)
But, as the report in [comment #1](/show_bug.cgi?id=408076#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - out of bounds read in BMP decoder can lead to information disclosure") says, the actual number of colorvalues in the table in the file is specified by biClrUser (if not zero)
MSDN: "biClrUser specifies the number of color indexes in the color table that are actually used by the bitmap. If this value is zero, the bitmap uses the maximum number of colors corresponding to the value of the biBitCount member for the compression mode specified by biCompression.
If biClrUsed is nonzero and the biBitCount member is less than 16, the biClrUsed member specifies the actual number of colors the graphics engine or device driver accesses.".
So, what actually needs to happen is that the mColors table is allocated according to bpp (as the pixel values coming from the image data are garanteed to be 1, 4 or 8 bit wide), but the decoder need to check for biClrUsed !=0 and in that case, only read that number colors from the file, and clear the table for the rest.
Note, that this is probably not really a security issue, as the decoder will now try to always read 256 color entries for the table, even if biClrUsed is < 256, resulting in using some of the actual image data itself for the colortable, and then the image data is itself will be not complete. So, the image will look like garbage, but one will not be able address any uninitialized values in the colortable... (but keep the 'security-sensitive' flag if really needed...).
So, now at least the colortable cleared and sane, but the reading of the image is not completely perfect.
P.s., the example code set biClrUsed to 'i', which is probably '256' given the code above? This is strange??Priority: P1 → --Target Milestone: mozilla1.9 M11 → ---

Tip:
Instead of:
mNumColors = 1 << mBIH.bpp;
if (mBIH.colors && mBIH.colors < mNumColors)
mNumColors = mBIH.colors;
mColors = new PRUint32[mNumColors];
if (!mColors)
return NS\_ERROR\_OUT\_OF\_MEMORY;
memset(mColors, 0, 256 \* sizeof(colorTable));
Do:
mNumColors = 1 << mBIH.bpp;
mColors = new PRUint32[mNumColors];
if (!mColors)
return NS\_ERROR\_OUT\_OF\_MEMORY;
memset(mColors, 0, mNumColors \* sizeof(colorTable));
if (mBIH.colors && mBIH.colors < mNumColors)
mNumColors = mBIH.colors;
As noted before, the index is never more than allowed by the 'bpp', but mBIH.colors can specify a smaller table. In the proposed way we allocate and clear the table according to bpp, and only read values according to mBIH.colors (if non-zero).

My current patch already does that... it doesn't change the value of mNumColors, which is what we use to determine how many color entries to read. It merely changes how much memory we allocate to hold any potential color values, and zeroes it to ensure no UMR.
I don't understand your other comment, it sounds like a spec compliance issue that was pre-existing and is unrelated to this bug.

That's already what happens... biClrUsed is mBIH.colors, and we use it to set mNumColors with and without my patch.
I could tweak my patch to allocate only bpp\*8 colorTable entries, rather than the maximum of 256, if that's what you're concerned about.

I also wrote a patch for this yesterday. Initially I also tried checking against mNumColors all the time and also came around to using a fixed-size table.
We could go with Alfred's suggestion of a variable sized table based on bpp, but the amount of memory saved is miniscule and simpler is better.

Just for the record, I am ok with the patch. It is the safest (in terms of protection and in terms of minimum impact) way, and won't harm that much.

Thanks Alfred.
I landed this patch with a comment pointing to [bug 408256](/show_bug.cgi?id=408256 "VERIFIED FIXED - Use a constant-size buffer in BMP decoder to reduce fragmentation") to avoid pointing out that this was a security fix to malicious people watching Bonsai.
This is now fixed on the trunk:
mozilla/modules/libpr0n/decoders/bmp/nsBMPDecoder.cpp 1.38Status: ASSIGNED → RESOLVEDClosed: 17 years agoResolution: --- → FIXED

Gavin, do I need to host this testcase elsewhere since your uploaded image is zipped?

No, the image is there only to be used in the modified testcase - it's linked to directly using a jar: URI. All you need to do to verify is load the "modified testcase" ([attachment 292786](/attachment.cgi?id=292786 "modified testcase") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=292786&action=edit "modified testcase")) multiple times, and make sure you always see a solid black line and that the textbox contains all zeroes, rather than random colors/numbers.

Any word from Apple or Opera on a fix date? I guess we shouldn't publish an advisory for 2.0.0.12 until we hear back.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
