    },
    "summary": "The vulnerability in Dovecot arises from a flaw in how it caches LDAP authentication data when specific configurations are used. If two users with the same password and matching `pass_filter` variables log in within the `auth_cache_ttl` period, the second user may inherit the cached `pass_attrs` of the first user. This results in the second user potentially accessing the first user's mail or other resources based on `pass_attrs`, if those include user specific information like home directory. The vulnerability exists in versions 1.0.rc11 and later. The root cause is that the base setting's %variables were not included in the auth cache key which broke the caching mechanism, causing incorrect user associations. The attack vector is through network login attempts to Dovecot. An attacker needs to have valid credentials and their password needs to be same as that of another user on the system, they also need to log in within the auth cache timeout period for the vulnerability to be exploited."
