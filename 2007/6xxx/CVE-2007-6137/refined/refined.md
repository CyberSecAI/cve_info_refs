Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-6137

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `Content Injector` version 1.52 application. The `cat` parameter in `index.php` is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Exposure: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and password hashes (MD5).
- Unauthorized Access: By obtaining admin credentials, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application's administrative interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a crafted `cat` parameter: `www.site.com/index.php?cat=99999/**/union/**/select/**/1,2,username,4,5,password,7,8,9/**/from/**/users/*`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability, since the vulnerable parameter is part of the URL

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit allows the attacker to view admin user details and MD5 hashed passwords.
- The admin login page is located at `/admin/`.
- The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` SQL injection technique to retrieve data from the `users` table.
