How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### [Websense Policy Filtering Bypass](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKv41ge8XcQ)

discovered by mrhinkydink

PRODUCT: Websense Enterprise 6.3.1

EXPOSURE: Web Filtering Bypass

SYNOPSIS
========

By spoofing the User-Agent header it is possible to bypass filtering and, to a lesser extent, monitoring in a Websense Enterprise 6.3.1 environment.

PROOF OF CONCEPT
================

The following was tested in an unpatched 6.3.1 system using the ISA Server integration product. It is assumed it will work with other integration products but this has not been tested. Other User Agents may also work.

I. Install FireFox 2.0.x

II. Obtain and install the User Agent Switcher browser plug-in by Chris Pederick

III. Add the following User Agents to the plug-in

 Description: RealPlayer
 User Agent : RealPlayer G2

 Description: MSN Messenger
 User Agent : MSMSGS

 Description: WebEx
 User Agent : StoneHttpAgent

IV. Change FireFox's User Agent to any one of the preceding values

V. Browse to a filtered Web site

VI. Content is allowed

Content browsed via this method will be recorded in the Websense database as being in the "Non-HTTP" category.

Demonstration:

[Websens Policy Bypass (obsolete)](http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoid=39865727)

SEE ALSO
========
Websense KnowledgeBase article #976

The vendor acknowledges this behavior in the aforementioned article.

WORKAROUND
==========
Disable the protocols mentioned above.

VENDOR RESPONSE
===============
Websense cleaned up this issue in database #92938

   As the ancients used to say, pride comes before a fall. :( The morning after I disclosed the Websense bypass, I checked my email & went into the kitchen to pack my lunch. I came back and the drive light on BOT House was flashing like crazy and there were disk-eating sounds coming from the box itself. The drive, a Fujistu 80G, had self-destructed.

   That evening I put the ISA server online and was at least able to get EXP II running.

   So... now I have a new HD and a lot of work to do.

   Glad you liked the movie. I had a lot of fun making it.

   ZSnDYcate here...

   Hink,

   Appreciate all the selfless time, effort and cash you put into maintaining BOT House and EXII. You may have other servers, but these two I visit almost daily as part of my post work unwind ritual. You've created a home for some of the best spirited and talented lo-grav players in UT99. Any chance those players that you repeatedly come across during reviews of your chat logger in either mentioned server getting a bot named after them? Over to you to please consider, or not:D I think it would be cool and I'm hoping you will too...a kind of homage to your loyal server fraggers... Looking fwd to the rtn of BOT House. Take Care Hink.

   Very Respectfully,
   Z

   Thanks for the kind words. BH is getting its shit back together slowly but I don't think it'll be back up until Christmas. Look out for a new IP on EXII before it goes back online. When that happens we're half way there.
