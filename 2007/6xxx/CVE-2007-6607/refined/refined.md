Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2007-6607:

**Vulnerability:** Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenBiblio 0.5.2-pre4 and prior.  While the provided document doesn't specifically detail CVE-2007-6607, it is listed alongside other CVEs and described as a  vulnerability. The other vulnerabilities are described in detail.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerabilities stem from insecure coding practices in OpenBiblio, specifically in handling user input, file inclusion, and database queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   Vulnerability 1: The `shared/help.php` file includes files based on the `page` GET parameter without proper sanitization.
        *   Code: `include("../locale/".OBIB_LOCALE."/help/".$page.".php");`
    *   Vulnerability 2: The `shared/header.php` file includes files based on the `tab` parameter without proper sanitization (requires register_globals On and magic_quotes_gpc Off).
        *   Code: `<?php include("../navbars/".$tab.".php");?>`
*   **Path Disclosure:** Error messages reveal the full server path of the application when display_errors is enabled in PHP.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple XSS vulnerabilities exist through GET parameters and POST data, allowing injection of malicious scripts.
    *   Examples: `admin/staff_del_confirm.php`, `admin/theme_del_confirm.php`, and `admin/theme_preview.php`
*   **SQL Injection:** The `reports/report_criteria.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `sql` parameter which allows users with 'report' role to extract any information from the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **LFI:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive information like configuration files or system files.
*   **Path Disclosure:**  Reveals server paths which provides attackers with information on the server layout and could aid in further attacks.
*   **XSS:** An attacker can steal user cookies, which can be used to impersonate the user.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive database information including admin passwords, and potentially modify the data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **LFI:** By crafting malicious URLs with manipulated GET parameters (`page` or `tab`).
*   **Path Disclosure:** By accessing pages that generate errors due to the code.
*   **XSS:** By crafting malicious URLs with manipulated GET parameters or by crafting a form that submits malicious data via POST.
*   **SQL Injection:** By crafting malicious URLs with manipulated GET parameters (`sql`) and a user with a report role.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **LFI:** No specific access is required to exploit the LFI.
*   **Path Disclosure:** No specific access is required.
*   **XSS:** No specific access is required.
*   **SQL Injection:** Requires a user with the 'report' role and knowledge of SQL.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory was released on 2008-01-01, but the vulnerabilities were discovered earlier.
* The advisory provides Proof of Concept (PoC) examples for most vulnerabilities.
* The advisory explicitly states to upgrade to version 0.6.0 which addresses all the described issues.
