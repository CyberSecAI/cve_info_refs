CVE-2007-6500
```

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple vulnerabilities exist due to inadequate input validation and access control mechanisms in Hosting Controller 6.1 Hot fix 3.3. These issues allow unauthorized users to perform administrative actions and access sensitive data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Remote attackers can log in to the Hosting Controller panel without proper credentials and change other users' passwords by exploiting vulnerable scripts like `addreseller.asp` in combination with `ChangeDisplay.htm` and `ChangePass.htm`.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload/Code Execution:** Users can upload files to web directories with administrative privileges by leveraging the `inc_newuser.asp` script, which sets full control permissions on certain directories. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with administrator privileges.
*   **Unauthorized User Creation:** Remote attackers can create new user accounts by manipulating parameters in `default.asp`, `selectdomain.asp`, and `addsubsite.asp`.
*   **Profile Manipulation:** Remote attackers can modify user profiles by exploiting the `Addreseller.asp` script along with `xml_addresellerresult.asp`, potentially through SQL injection in the email or login name fields.
*   **SQL Injection:** Users can view sensitive database information via SQL injection vulnerabilities in the `accountmanager.asp` script. Specific examples provided allow access to user lists, admin properties, SQL server info, IIS passwords, credit card data, DSN, domain registration information, and gateway details.
*   **Credit/Discount Manipulation:** Users can change their credit amount or increase discounts using the `AccountActions.asp` script.
*   **FrontPage Extension Uninstallation:** Users can uninstall FrontPage extensions of other users by sending a "host" ID to `UNINSTAL.asp`.
*   **Gateway Information Deletion:** Users can delete gateway information directly through `GatewayVariables.asp` or via SQL injection.
*   **Pay Type Manipulation:** Users can enable or disable payment types by accessing `choosetranstype.asp` directly.
*  **Username Enumeration:** Users can see all usernames on the server using the `NEWSRVR.asp` script.
*   **Path Disclosure:** Users can find the Hosting Controller setup directory via `css.asp`, particularly by exploiting `FindMap.asp`.
*  **Plan Manipulation:** Users can import unwanted plans or change existing plans via `importhostingplans.asp` and `AutoSignUpPlans.asp`.
*   **Website Path Disclosure:** Remote attackers can find the website path by triggering an error in `admin/forum/`.
*   **Forum Manipulation:** Remote attackers can enable or disable forums via SQL injection in `DisableForum.asp` and `EnableForum.asp`.
*   **Host Header Manipulation:** Users can change host headers via the `iibind.asp` script, which is also vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Full system administrator access
*   Remote code execution with administrative privileges
*   Unauthorized user creation and profile modification
*   Data breaches and disclosure of sensitive information
*   Financial manipulation (credit/discount changes)
*   Denial of service (via deletion of gateway info, disabling forums, etc.)
*   Website and service disruption (host header changes, FrontPage extension removal)
*  Complete compromise of the Hosting Controller server and hosted websites

**Attack vectors:**
*   HTTP requests to vulnerable ASP scripts
*   Direct URL manipulation
*   Form submissions
*   SQL Injection

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Remote attackers can exploit many vulnerabilities without any prior authentication
*   Some exploits require an existing user account (but with limited privileges)
