Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-6462:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `fullnews.php` file of the "PHP Real Estate" application. The `id` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. An attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter to inject malicious SQL code into the database query. This can allow an attacker to bypass security checks and access or modify database content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information stored in the database, such as usernames and passwords, as demonstrated in the provided exploit example targeting the `admin` table.
*   **Potential System Compromise:** Depending on the database privileges and the structure of the application, the attacker could potentially gain more control over the application and the underlying system.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker can potentially bypass authentication mechanisms by extracting admin credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `fullnews.php` file, manipulating the `id` parameter.
*   **URL Parameter Injection:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `id` parameter, taken directly from the URL, is not properly escaped or validated before being incorporated into a database query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL queries that can be injected into the application's database queries.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication to the web application.

**Exploit Details:**

The provided exploit is:

```
www.site.com/fullnews.php?id=-1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,2,concat(username,char(58),password),4,5/**/FROM/**/admin/*
```

This SQL injection attempts to:

1.  Use `-1` to ensure no valid record is returned from the initial query.
2.  Use `UNION ALL SELECT` to inject a new query.
3.  Retrieve the `username` and `password` from the `admin` table, concatenating them using `char(58)` (colon).

This extracted information could then be used to log in to the admin interface at `/admin/`.
