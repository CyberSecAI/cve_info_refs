Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `printview.php` file of PNphpBB2 versions 1.2i and earlier.
- The script includes a file based on the user-controlled `$phpEx` variable without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI. The `$phpEx` parameter in `printview.php` is vulnerable to directory traversal. By manipulating this parameter, an attacker can include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, potentially including configuration files containing database credentials, source code, or system files like `/etc/passwd`.
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the disclosure of sensitive information on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP request to `printview.php` with a manipulated `phpEx` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The exploit does not appear to require any prior authentication.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable file:** The attacker needs to know the path to the `printview.php` and how to exploit the $phpEx parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The `printview.php` script includes a file using this line:  `include($phpbb_root_path . 'common.'.$phpEx);` where `$phpbb_root_path` is something like './modules/PNphpBB2/'.
- The `$phpEx` variable is directly taken from the GET parameter without sanitization, allowing directory traversal with values like `/../../../../../../etc/passwd` or a similar relative path.
- The exploit examples provided show the full URL structure: `http://[host]/[path]/modules/PNphpBB2/printview.php?phpEx=/../../../../../../../etc/passwd` and `http://[host]/[path]/modules/PNphpBB2/printview.php?phpEx=[LFI]`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by irk4z.
- The exploit was published on milw0rm.com.
- The vulnerable software is PNphpBB2 versions 1.2i and earlier.
- The blog post also mentions a similar LFI vulnerability in `pninit.php`, but the exploit details are not provided for it.
