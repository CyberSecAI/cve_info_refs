{
  "CVE-2007-6388": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the mod_status module. On sites where mod_status is enabled and the status pages were publicly accessible, a cross-site scripting attack is possible. Note that the server-status page is not enabled by default and it is best practice to not make this publicly available.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The mod_status module does not properly sanitize input which allows for injection of malicious code",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML which can be used to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), within the same domain.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to convince a victim to view server output during a crafted server request.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the server-status page to be enabled and publicly accessible"
  }
}
