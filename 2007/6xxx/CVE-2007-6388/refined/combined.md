# Apache HTTP Server 2.2 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.2. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 2.2 is End-of-Life since December 2017 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before the End-of-Life. Subsequent issues may have affected 2.2 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.35-never

### low: Use-after-free when using <Limit > with an unrecognized method in .htaccess ("OptionsBleed") ([CVE-2017-9798](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9798))

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned. Users are encouraged to migrate to 2.4.28 or later for this and other fixes.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Hanno Böck for reporting this issue.

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### moderate: apr\_fnmatch flaw leads to mod\_autoindex remote DoS ([CVE-2011-0419](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0419))

A flaw was found in the apr\_fnmatch() function of the bundled APR library. Where mod\_autoindex is enabled, and a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

Workaround: Setting the 'IgnoreClient' option to the 'IndexOptions' directive disables processing of the client-supplied request query arguments, preventing this attack.

Resolution: Update APR to release 1.4.5 (bundled with httpd 2.2.19) or release 0.9.20 (bundled with httpd 2.0.65)

### low: mod\_cache and mod\_dav DoS ([CVE-2010-1452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1452))

A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod\_cache (2.2) and mod\_dav (2.0 and 2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM. This issue is further mitigated as mod\_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod\_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers" directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.

### important: Timeout detection flaw (mod\_proxy\_http) ([CVE-2010-2068](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2068))

An information disclosure flaw was found in mod\_proxy\_http in versions 2.2.9 through 2.2.15, 2.3.4-alpha and 2.3.5-alpha. Under certain timeout conditions, the server could return a response intended for another user. Only Windows, Netware and OS2 operating systems are affected. Only those configurations which trigger the use of proxy worker pools are affected. There was no vulnerability on earlier versions, as proxy pools were not yet introduced.

The simplest workaround is to globally configure;

SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1

### important: mod\_isapi module unload flaw ([CVE-2010-0425](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0425))

A flaw was found with within mod\_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod\_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

### low: Subrequest handling of request headers (mod\_headers) ([CVE-2010-0434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0434))

A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy of the headers\_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod\_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

Please close and restart all running instances of Apache after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.

# Apache HTTP Server 2.0 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.0. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 2.0 has had no new releases since 2013 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before August 2013. Subsequent issues may have affected 2.0 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.0.65

### moderate: apr\_fnmatch flaw leads to mod\_autoindex remote DoS ([CVE-2011-0419](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0419))

A flaw was found in the apr\_fnmatch() function of the bundled APR library. Where mod\_autoindex is enabled, and a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

Workaround: Setting the 'IgnoreClient' option to the 'IndexOptions' directive disables processing of the client-supplied request query arguments, preventing this attack.

Resolution: Update APR to release 1.4.5 (bundled with httpd 2.2.19) or release 0.9.20 (bundled with httpd 2.0.65)

### important: Range header remote DoS ([CVE-2011-3192](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3192))

A flaw was found in the way the Apache HTTP Server handled Range HTTP headers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd to use an excessive amount of memory and CPU time via HTTP requests with a specially-crafted Range header. This could be used in a denial of service attack. Advisory: CVE-2011-3192.txt

### moderate: mod\_proxy reverse proxy exposure ([CVE-2011-3368](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3368))

An exposure was found when using mod\_proxy in reverse proxy mode. In certain configurations using RewriteRule with proxy flag or ProxyPassMatch, a remote attacker could cause the reverse proxy to connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing sensitive information from internal web servers not directly accessible to attacker. No update of 1.3 will be released.

Patches will be published to https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply\_to\_1.3.42/

### important: mod\_isapi module unload flaw ([CVE-2010-0425](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0425))

A flaw was found with within mod\_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod\_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

### low: Subrequest handling of request headers (mod\_headers) ([CVE-2010-0434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0434))

A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy of the headers\_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod\_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

### low: mod\_cache and mod\_dav DoS ([CVE-2010-1452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1452))

A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod\_cache (2.2) and mod\_dav (2.0 and 2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM. This issue is further mitigated as mod\_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod\_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers" directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.

A flaw was found in handling of versioning hooks in mod\_dav. An attacker could send a carefully crafted request in such a way to cause the child process handling the connection to crash. This issue will only result in a denial of service where a threaded process model is in use.

| Issue public | 2002-09-19 |

| Update 2.0.42 released | 2002-09-24 |
| Affects | 2.0.40, 2.0.39, 2.0.37, 2.0.36, 2.0.35 |

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.0.40

### low: Path revealing exposures ([CVE-2002-0654](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0654))

A path-revealing exposure was present in multiview type map negotiation (such as the default error documents) where a module would report the full path of the typemapped .var file when multiple documents or no documents could be served. Additionally a path-revealing exposure in cgi/cgid when Apache fails to invoke a script. The modules would report "couldn't create child process /path-to-script/script.pl" revealing the full path of the script.

### important: Path vulnerability ([CVE-2002-0661](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0661))

Certain URIs would bypass security and allow users to invoke or access any file depending on the system configuration. Affects Windows, OS2, Netware and Cygwin platforms only.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.0.37

### critical: Apache Chunked encoding vulnerability ([CVE-2002-0392](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0392))

Malicious requests can cause various effects ranging from a relatively harmless increase in system resources through to denial of service attacks and in some cases the ability to execute arbitrary remote code.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.0.36

### low: Warning messages could be displayed to users ([CVE-2002-1592](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1592))

In some cases warning messages could get returned to end users in addition to being recorded in the error log. This could reveal the path to a CGI script for example, a minor security exposure.

## Details

It was discovered that Apache did not sanitize the Expect header from

an HTTP request when it is reflected back in an error message, which

could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting

attacks when processing the output. With cross-site scripting

vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output

during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this

to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords),

within the same domain. This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 6.06.

([CVE-2006-3918](/security/CVE-2006-3918))

It was discovered that when configured as a proxy server and using a

threaded MPM, Apache did not properly sanitize its input. A remote

attacker could send Apache crafted date headers and cause a denial of

service via application crash. By default, mod\_proxy is disabled in

Ubuntu. ([CVE-2007-3847](/security/CVE-2007-3847))

It was discovered that mod\_autoindex did not force a character set,

which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site

scripting attacks when processing the output. ([CVE-2007-4465](/security/CVE-2007-4465))

It was discovered that mod\_imap/mod\_imagemap did not force a

character set, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable

to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output. By

default, mod\_imap/mod\_imagemap is disabled in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2007-5000](/security/CVE-2007-5000))

It was discovered that mod\_status when status pages were available,

allowed for cross-site scripting attacks. By default, mod\_status is

disabled in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2007-6388](/security/CVE-2007-6388))

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_balancer did not sanitize its input,

which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site

scripting attacks when processing the output. By default,

mod\_proxy\_balancer is disabled in Ubuntu. This was only vulnerable

in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-6421](/security/CVE-2007-6421))

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_balancer could be made to

dereference a NULL pointer. A remote attacker could send a crafted

request and cause a denial of service via application crash. By

default, mod\_proxy\_balancer is disabled in Ubuntu. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-6422](/security/CVE-2007-6422))

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ftp did not force a character set,

which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site

scripting attacks when processing the output. By default,

mod\_proxy\_ftp is disabled in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2008-0005](/security/CVE-2008-0005))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable versions of
httpd, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected
package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

[website](http://support.avaya.com/) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support

SecurityAlert Id: 50
CVE: CVE-2007-6388
SecurityRisk: Low
Affected Software: Apache 2.2.x (mod\_status)
Apache 1.3.x
Apache 2.0.x
Advisory URL: http://securityreason.com/achievement\_securityalert/50
Vendor: http://httpd.apache.org
- --- 0.Description ---
The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and
maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems
including UNIX and Windows NT. The goal of this project is to
provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides
HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards.
Apache has been the most popular web server on the Internet since
April 1996. The November 2005 Netcraft Web Server Survey found
that more than 70% of the web sites on the Internet are using
Apache, thus making it more widely used than all other web
servers combined.
mod\_status : http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod\_status.html
- From apache site : "The Status module allows a server administrator to find out how well their server is performing. A HTML page is presented that gives the current server statistics in an easily readable form. If required this page can be made to automatically refresh (given a compatible browser). Another page gives a simple machine-readable list of the current server state."
- --- 1. Apache Refresh Header - Open Redirector (XSS) Vulnerability ---
During the fact that Apache mod\_status do not filter char ";" we can inject new URL.
This fact give attacker open redirector and can lead to phishing attack.
Also attacker can create more advanced method to trigger XSS on victim's browser.
- --- 2. Exploit ---
SecurityReason is not going to release a exploit to the general public.
Exploit was provided and tested for Apache Team .
- --- 3. How to fix ---

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

In the environment definition file (httpd.conf), either delete the directives shown below, or put a hash sign (#) at the start of the line to change it to a comment and so disable the server status monitoring function. Then restart the Web server.

* Product [a]

  #LoadModule status\_module modules/mod\_status.so

  #AddModule mod\_status.c

  #ExtendedStatus On

  #< Location /server-status >

  #    SetHandler server-status

  #    .

  #    .

  #    .

  #< /Location >
* Product [b]

  #LoadModule status\_module "C:/Interstage/F3FMihs/modules/mod\_status.so"

  #ExtendedStatus On

  #< Location /server-status >

  #    SetHandler server-status

  #    .

  #    .

  #    .

  #< /Location >
* Product [c]

  #LoadModule status\_module libexec/mod\_status.so

  #AddModule mod\_status.c

  #ExtendedStatus On

  #< Location /server-status >

  #    SetHandler server-status

  #    .

  #    .

  #    .

  #< /Location >
* Product [d]

  #LoadModule status\_module "/opt/FJSVihs/modules/mod\_status.so"

  #ExtendedStatus On

  #< Location /server-status >

  #    SetHandler server-status

  #    .

  #    .

# Apache HTTP Server 1.3 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 1.3. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 1.3 has had no new releases since 2010 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before March 2010. Subsequent issues may have affected 1.3 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

### moderate: mod\_proxy buffer overflow ([CVE-2004-0492](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0492))

A buffer overflow was found in the Apache proxy module, mod\_proxy, which can be triggered by receiving an invalid Content-Length header. In order to exploit this issue an attacker would need to get an Apache installation that was configured as a proxy to connect to a malicious site. This would cause the Apache child processing the request to crash, although this does not represent a significant Denial of Service attack as requests will continue to be handled by other Apache child processes. This issue may lead to remote arbitrary code execution on some BSD platforms.

### low: mod\_digest nonce checking ([CVE-2003-0987](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0987))

mod\_digest does not properly verify the nonce of a client response by using a AuthNonce secret. This could allow a malicious user who is able to sniff network traffic to conduct a replay attack against a website using Digest protection. Note that mod\_digest implements an older version of the MD5 Digest Authentication specification which is known not to work with modern browsers. This issue does not affect mod\_auth\_digest.

### important: Denial of service attack on Win32 and OS2 ([CVE-2001-1342](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1342))

A vulnerability was found in the Win32 and OS2 ports of Apache 1.3. A client submitting a carefully constructed URI could cause a General Protection Fault in a child process, bringing up a message box which would have to be cleared by the operator to resume operation. This vulnerability introduced no identified means to compromise the server other than introducing a possible denial of service.

| Affects | 1.3.20, 1.3.19?, 1.3.17?, 1.3.14?, 1.3.12?, 1.3.11?, 1.3.9?, 1.3.6?, 1.3.4?, 1.3.3?, 1.3.2?, 1.3.1?, 1.3.0? |

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 1.3.19

### important: Requests can cause directory listing to be displayed ([CVE-2001-0925](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0925))

The default installation can lead mod\_negotiation and mod\_dir or mod\_autoindex to display a directory listing instead of the multiview index.html file if a very long path was created artificially by using many slashes.

| Update 1.3.19 released | 2001-02-28 |
| --- | --- |
| Affects | 1.3.17, 1.3.14, 1.3.12, 1.3.11 |

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 1.3.14

### moderate: Requests can cause directory listing to be displayed on NT ([CVE-2000-0505](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-0505))

A security hole on Apache for Windows allows a user to view the listing of a directory instead of the default HTML page by sending a carefully constructed request.

| Update 1.3.14 released | 2000-10-13 |
| --- | --- |
| Affects | 1.3.12, 1.3.11?, 1.3.9?, 1.3.6?, 1.3.4?, 1.3.3?, 1.3.2?, 1.3.1?, 1.3.0? |

### important: Rewrite rules that include references allow access to any file ([CVE-2000-0913](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-0913))

The Rewrite module, mod\_rewrite, can allow access to any file on the web server. The vulnerability occurs only with certain specific cases of using regular expression references in RewriteRule directives: If the destination of a RewriteRule contains regular expression references then an attacker will be able to access any file on the server.

| --- | --- |
| Update 1.3.14 released | 2000-10-13 |
| Affects | 1.3.12, 1.3.11?, 1.3.9?, 1.3.6?, 1.3.4?, 1.3.3?, 1.3.2?, 1.3.1?, 1.3.0? |

### important: Mass virtual hosting can display CGI source ([CVE-2000-1204](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-1204))

A security problem for users of the mass virtual hosting module, mod\_vhost\_alias, causes the source to a CGI to be sent if the cgi-bin directory is under the document root. However, it is not normal to have your cgi-bin directory under a document root.

| Update 1.3.14 released | 2000-10-13 |
| --- | --- |
| Affects | 1.3.12, 1.3.11, 1.3.9 |

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 1.3.12

### important: Cross-site scripting can reveal private session information ([CVE-2000-1205](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-1205))

Apache was vulnerable to cross site scripting issues. It was shown that malicious HTML tags can be embedded in client web requests if the server or script handling the request does not carefully encode all information displayed to the user. Using these vulnerabilities attackers could, for example, obtain copies of your private cookies used to authenticate you to other sites.

| Update 1.3.12 released | 2000-02-25 |
| --- | --- |
| Affects | 1.3.11, 1.3.9, 1.3.6, 1.3.4, 1.3.3, 1.3.2, 1.3.1, 1.3.0 |

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 1.3.11

### moderate: Mass virtual hosting security issue ([CVE-2000-1206](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-1206))

A security problem can occur for sites using mass name-based virtual hosting (using the new mod\_vhost\_alias module) or with special mod\_rewrite rules.

| Update 1.3.11 released | 2000-01-21 |
| --- | --- |
| Affects | 1.3.9, 1.3.6?, 1.3.4?, 1.3.3?, 1.3.2?, 1.3.1?, 1.3.0? |

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 1.3.2

### important: Multiple header Denial of Service vulnerability ([CVE-1999-1199](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1199))

A serious problem exists when a client sends a large number of headers with the same header name. Apache uses up memory faster than the amount of memory required to simply store the received data itself. That is, memory use increases faster and faster as more headers are received, rather than increasing at a constant rate. This makes a denial of service attack based on this method more effective than methods which cause Apache to use memory at a constant rate, since the attacker has to send less data.

| Update 1.3.2 released | 1998-09-23 |
