  "cve": "CVE-2007-6720",
  "description": "libmikmod 3.1.9 through 3.2.0, as used by MikMod, SDL-mixer, and possibly other products, relies on the channel count of the last loaded song, rather than the currently playing song, for certain playback calculations, which allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) by loading multiple songs (aka MOD files) with different numbers of channels.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from libmikmod using the channel count of the last loaded song instead of the currently playing song for certain playback calculations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect use of a global variable `md_sngchn` to store the number of channels which is not updated when switching songs.",
      "Insufficient checks on the channel counts when processing audio data.",
	  "Lack of proper memory management related to the number of audio channels."
    ],
    "impact": "A user-assisted attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash) by loading multiple songs with varying numbers of channels.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Loading multiple MOD files with different channel counts."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious sequence of audio files (MOD format) to the victim application or user.",
	"affected_components": [
		"libmikmod library",
		"Applications using libmikmod directly",
		"SDL-mixer library which used libmikmod"
	]
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "MikMod",
    "SDL-mixer",
	"Possibly other products using libmikmod"
  ],
  "patch_details": {
    "fixes": [
		"Correctly use the number of channels of the currently playing song for calculations.",
		"Apply a patch that makes sdl-mixer work properly.",
      "Update libmikmod to version 3.1.11-6.1 or later."
