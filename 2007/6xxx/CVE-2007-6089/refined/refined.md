  "CVE-2007-6089": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "meBiblio 0.4.5 is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to the insecure use of the 'action' parameter in `index.php`. The application includes files based on the value of this parameter without proper sanitization.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The application directly includes files based on the user-controlled `action` parameter without proper sanitization.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, potentially leading to complete system compromise. This could involve executing malicious scripts, gaining unauthorized access to the server, or manipulating sensitive data.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "By crafting a malicious URL with a remote URL in the action parameter"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server and host a malicious file on a server accessible to the target. The `register_globals` setting being enabled on the server hosting the application is also a requirement."
