{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an assert trip or a `bcopy (NULL, ....)` in the `cs_validate_page` function, triggered when the `hashes()` function returns NULL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of NULL return values",
       "Potential for a NULL pointer dereference in `bcopy`"
    ],
    "impact": "Local kernel Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": "A local attacker can trigger the vulnerability by manipulating code signature data within a file. The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) modifies the number of code slots to cause a NULL return from `hashes()`.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to execute a crafted program on the target system."
