        "Vulnerability": {
            "Root cause": "The application includes a file using a user-controlled parameter, `kfm_base_path`, in the `admin/kfm/initialise.php` file through a require statement. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary files.",
            "Weaknesses": [
                "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
            ],
            "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious PHP file from a remote location.",
            "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `kfm_base_path` GET parameter in the `admin/kfm/initialise.php` file.",
             "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to a remote file server hosting the malicious PHP file."
        },
         "Additional Information": "The vulnerable code is located in `admin/kfm/initialise.php`. The vulnerability is triggered by the `require` statements that use the attacker controlled variable `kfm_base_path`. The exploit is demonstrated with an example URL. The software affected is 'DevMass Shopping Cart' version 1.0."
