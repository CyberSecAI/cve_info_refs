```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the TinyMCE module of CMS Made Simple, specifically in the `content_css.php` file. The `templateid` parameter from the GET request is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection. The lack of input validation on the `templateid` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to read sensitive data (such as usernames and passwords) or modify/delete information.
  - Attack vectors: The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `content_css.php` file. The attacker manipulates the `templateid` parameter to include malicious SQL code.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target web server. They don't need any special privileges or access to other parts of the system.
