How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Digital Bond Archives

In 2018 we moved the digitalbond.com content to dale-peterson.com for consulting and public speaking and [s4xevents.com](https://s4xevents.com) for S4 content. The old site hosted almost 2000 blog entries. This was before social media, and we were putting out about 7 per week. We have moved the still pertinent half of those to this site, and you can see them archived by year.

Most of the research projects have been dorment for a number of years including the Quickdraw ICS IDS signatures, Bandolier Security Audit Files, Portaledge SCADA SIEM, Redpoint Nmap NSE Scripts, PLC Honeynet, Basecamp Metasploit Modules and more. Now that there is a market for ICS security products these proof of concept research has served its purpose. Some of the remnants of these products are available on Github.

## Invensys Wonderware InTouch creates insecure NetDDE share

#### Vulnerability Note VU#138633

Original Release Date: 2007-11-19 | Last Revised: 2008-02-26

---

### Overview

Invensys Wonderware InTouch 8.0 creates a NetDDE share that could allow an attacker to run arbitrary programs.

### Description

| Invensys Wonderware [InTouch](http://us.wonderware.com/products/intouch/index.htm) HMI Software is used in Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.  Dynamic Data Exchange ([DDE](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms648711.aspx)) was designed to allow Microsoft Windows applications to share data. [NetDDE](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;125703) is an extension to DDE that was developed by Wonderware. NetDDE allows communications with local DDE applications and with remote NetDDE agents using NetBIOS. NetDDE is not supported in Windows Vista, but is included in Windows NT, 2000, XP, and Server 2003.InTouch 8.0 creates a universal NetDDE share. The permissions applied to the share may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary programs. Windows access permissions apply to NetDDE connections, however if an attacker can obtain valid credentials, or [possibly](http://lists.immunitysec.com/pipermail/dailydave/2004-October/001014.html) if anonymous connections are enabled, the attacker could connect to the NetDDE share and execute programs.Other vendors may also create insecure NetDDE shares. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to execute any application that accepts NetDDE connections. This could allow an attacker to gain control of the system running NetDDE |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**This issue has been addressed in Wonderware InTouch version 9 and later. Wonderware administrators with active support contracts who do not want to upgrade can get an updated version of Wonderware 8.0. Wonderware [Tech Alert 98](http://pacwest.wonderware.com/web/News/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsThreadID=2&NewsID=201804) contains information about obtaining fixed software. Wonderware administrators can also contact Wonderware for more information about obtaining updates.Please see the Systems Affected section below for information about other vendors. |
| --- |

| **Disable NetDDE**If NetDDE is not required, disable the Network DDE and Network DDE DSDM services.**Limit NetDDE share privileges**If NetDDE is required, configure shares to have the least necessary privileges. From [Digital Bond](http://www.digitalbond.com/index.php/2008/01/29/vulnerable-netdde-shares-lead-to-complete-system-compromise/ "Vulnerable NetDDE Shares Lead To Complete System Compromise"): "NetDDE allows a system to limit access to specific applications, documents, and even portions of the documents. Access and permissions can be set by user or group as well. The key is to avoid the wide open share like seen in the \*|\*." Also, unless absolutely required, do not configure anonymous users to be members of the Everyone group (see KB [278259](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/278259 "Everyone Group Does Not Include Anonymous Security Identifier") for more information).**Restrict NetDDE access**Per Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-031](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS04-031.mspx) (which describes an unrelated NetDDE vulnerability in Windows), blocking the below ports at perimeter firewalls can prevent remote NetDDE connections (as well as NetBIOS and SMB connections).     + Ports 135/udp, 137/udp, 138/udp, 445/udp, 135/tcp, 139/tcp, 445/tcp, and 593/tcp + All unsolicited inbound traffic on ports greater than 1024 + Any other specifically configured RPC port |
