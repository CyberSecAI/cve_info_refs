{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The BadBlue server copies the URI received by the client into a stack buffer of 4096 bytes using `strcpy()`, without proper bounds checking, when the `PassThru` command of `ext.dll` is invoked.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
       "Use of strcpy without bounds checking."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by overflowing the buffer.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `ext.dll` file with the `PassThru` command and an overly long URI."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The server must also have the vulnerable `ext.dll` file loaded."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The provided exploit code demonstrates how to send a malicious GET request to trigger the buffer overflow and execute shellcode on the target Windows system. The exploit includes a bind shellcode that listens on port 4444. The vulnerability was reported by Luigi Auriemma."
