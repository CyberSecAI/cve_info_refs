Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-6420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of proper security measures in the `mod_proxy_balancer` module of the Apache HTTP Server, specifically within its balancer-manager interface. The balancer-manager used GET requests for actions with side effects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The balancer-manager interface uses GET requests for actions that modify the server configuration. An attacker could craft a malicious link or web page that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, would cause the server to execute unintended actions.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Input passed to the "ss", "wr", and "rr" parameters in the balancer-manager are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or script code into a victim's browser.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Inputting an invalid value for the `bb` parameter while editing worker settings in the balancer-manager could cause a denial of service.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Inputting long strings of "A" characters in the URL (specifically 7390, 7506, or 7622) can cause memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CSRF:** An attacker could potentially modify the balancer manager configuration.
*   **XSS:** An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code in the browser of a victim, potentially leading to information theft or further attacks.
*   **DoS:** An attacker could cause the server to crash, making it unavailable to users.
*   **Memory Corruption:**  An attacker could crash the server or potentially perform code execution due to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF:** The attacker would need to entice a logged-in administrator to click a malicious link or visit a crafted web page.
*   **XSS:** The attacker can embed malicious code in the "ss", "wr", and "rr" parameters of the balancer-manager interface.
*   **DoS:** The attacker needs to send an HTTP request with the invalid "bb" parameter to the balancer-manager.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The attacker needs to send an HTTP request with long strings of "A" characters (7390, 7506, or 7622) to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **CSRF:** The attacker needs to target a logged-in administrator.
*   **XSS:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely.
*   **DoS:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely.

**Additional Information:**

* The vulnerability affects Apache 2.2.x versions and was fixed in version 2.2.9
* The `balancer-manager` interface should only be accessible to trusted users.
* The advisory mentions that the `balancer-manager` should be using POST requests for actions with side effects instead of GET requests to prevent CSRF attacks.
