{
  "CVE-2007-6206": {
    "description": "Blake Frantz discovered that when a core file owned by a non-root user exists, and a root-owned process dumps core over it, the core file retains its original ownership. This could be used by a local user to gain access to sensitive information.",
    "root_cause": "When a root-owned process overwrites an existing core file, the resulting core file retains the previous core file's ownership.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure handling of file ownership during core dumps."
    ],
    "impact": "A local user could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information present in a core dump file.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local user needs write access to a directory where a root process can write a core dump."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local user with write access to a directory. Ability to cause a root-owned process to core dump."
  }
