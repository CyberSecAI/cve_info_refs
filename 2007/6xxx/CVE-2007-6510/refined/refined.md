  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The code of some rippers in ProWizard has buffer overflows due to arrays being too small for the data they're meant to hold.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to insufficient array sizes (e.g., arrays of 128 elements instead of 255, or 31 instead of 255)."

        "By processing specially crafted music files with vulnerable rippers."
