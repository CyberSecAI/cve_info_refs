Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described in the Atlassian Security Advisory:

**1. XSS vulnerability in Issue Actions**

*   **Root Cause:** The `500page.jsp` file does not properly HTML-escape error messages, allowing user-controlled input to be rendered as HTML or JavaScript.
*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS). A malicious user can inject arbitrary HTML tags or scripts into an issue action, which is then displayed to other users.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Stealing session cookies or other user credentials by sending them to the attacker's server.
    *   Displaying malicious content to other users viewing JIRA issues, potentially damaging the company's reputation.
*   **Attack Vector:** By injecting malicious input through issue actions.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Needs the ability to interact with the system and inject malicious code via the described vulnerability.

**2. Anyone can delete a filter which is shared with them**

*   **Root Cause:** The system does not verify if a user is the owner of a filter before allowing them to delete it.
*   **Vulnerability:** Inadequate authorization checks during filter deletion.
*  **Impact:** Users can delete filters shared with them, causing inconvenience to the filter owner.
*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the filter ID during the deletion process.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a valid account with access to shared filters.

**3. Default language setting can be changed by an unauthorised user**

*   **Root Cause:** The setup wizard pages can be accessed even after setup, allowing the default language to be changed without proper checks.
*   **Vulnerability:** Lack of proper checks after initial setup allows unauthorized changes to the default language.
*   **Impact:** Malicious users can change the default language, potentially damaging the company's reputation and causing inconvenience.
*   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the setup wizard pages after setup completion.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to manually access the setup wizard URL.

**Summary of the Fixes**
*  For the XSS issue: HTML-escape all error messages rendered on the 500 page.
*  For the filter deletion issue: Verify that the logged-in user is the owner of the filter before deletion.
*  For the default language issue: Prevent access to the setup wizard pages after initial setup.
