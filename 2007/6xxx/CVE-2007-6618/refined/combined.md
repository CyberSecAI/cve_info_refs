How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security vulnerabilities

## XSS vulnerability in Issue Actions

#### Severity

Atlassian rates this vulnerability as **HIGH**, according to the scale published in the [JIRA Security documentation](/jira/security-advisories-112853939.html#SecurityAdvisories-SeverityLevels). This scale allows us to rank a vulnerability as critical, high, moderate or low.

#### Risk Assessment

We have identified and fixed a security flaw which may affect JIRA instances in a public environment. This flaw is an XSS (cross-site scripting) vulnerability in JIRA's issue actions, which potentially allows a malicious user (hacker) to insert their own HTML tags or script into an action.

* The hacker might take advantage of this flaw to steal other users' session cookies or other credentials, by sending the credentials back to the hacker's own web server.
* The hacker's text and script might be displayed to other people viewing the JIRA issue. This is potentially damaging to your company's reputation.

Atlassian recommends that you upgrade to [JIRA 3.12.1](/jira/jira-3-12-1-release-notes-112853953.html), or download the patch for JIRA 3.11 or 3.10.2, to fix the vulnerabilities described below.

You can read more about XSS attacks at [cgisecurity](http://www.cgisecurity.com/articles/xss-faq.shtml), [CERT](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html) and other places on the web.

#### Risk Mitigation

If you judge it necessary, you can disable public access (i.e. anonymous access and public signup) to your JIRA system until you have applied the necessary patch or upgrade. For even tighter control, you could restrict JIRA access to trusted groups only.

#### Vulnerability

All issue actions (e.g. 'Create issue') are affected. The problem is with `500page.jsp`. It does not HTML-escape the error messages it prints out.

#### Fix

The fix is to escape all of the error messages rendered on the 500 page, so that no user input, which is propagated to error messages, is interpreted as HTML or CSS.

This issue has been fixed in [JIRA 3.12.1](/jira/jira-3-12-1-release-notes-112853953.html). The fix is also provided as a patch for JIRA 3.12, 3.11 and 3.10.2. For more information, please see [JRA-14105](http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-14105).

## Anyone can delete a filter which is shared with them

#### Severity

Atlassian rates this vulnerability as **LOW**, according to the scale published in the [JIRA Security documentation](/jira/security-advisories-112853939.html#SecurityAdvisories-SeverityLevels). This scale allows us to rank a vulnerability as critical, high, moderate or low.

#### Risk Assessment

We have identified and fixed a security flaw which may affect JIRA instances in a public environment. This flaw allows users to delete filters which are shared with them, which is an inconvenience to the user who is the true owner of the filter.

Atlassian recommends that you upgrade to [JIRA 3.12.1](/jira/jira-3-12-1-release-notes-112853953.html), or download the patch for JIRA 3.12, 3.11 or 3.10.2, to fix the vulnerabilities described below.

#### Risk Mitigation

If you judge it necessary, you can disable public access (i.e. anonymous access and public signup) to your JIRA system until you have applied the necessary patch or upgrade. For even tighter control, you could instruct all users to share their filters with trusted groups only (i.e. instruct them not to use 'Global' sharing).

#### Vulnerability

When a user commences deleting one of their own filters, if they replace their filter ID with the ID of another user's filter which is shared with them, they can delete the other user's filter.

#### Fix

The fix is to check that the currently logged-in user is indeed the owner of the filter, before deleting a filter.

This issue has been fixed in [JIRA 3.12.1](/jira/jira-3-12-1-release-notes-112853953.html). The fix is also provided as a patch for JIRA 3.12, 3.11 and 3.10.2. For more information, please see [JRA-13999](http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-13999).

## Default language setting can be changed by an unauthorised user

#### Severity

Atlassian rates this vulnerability as **LOW**, according to the scale published in the [JIRA Security documentation](/jira/security-advisories-112853939.html#SecurityAdvisories-SeverityLevels). This scale allows us to rank a vulnerability as critical, high, moderate or low.

#### Risk Assessment

We have identified and fixed a security flaw which may affect JIRA instances in a public environment. This flaw potentially allows a malicious user (hacker) to change the default language of your JIRA instance, which is potentially damaging to your company's reputation, and an inconvenience to users.

Atlassian recommends that you upgrade to [JIRA 3.12.1](/jira/jira-3-12-1-release-notes-112853953.html), or download the patch for JIRA 3.11 or 3.10.2, to fix the vulnerabilities described below.

#### Risk Mitigation

If you judge it necessary, you can disable public access (i.e. anonymous access and public signup) to your JIRA system until you have applied the necessary patch or upgrade. For even tighter control, you could restrict JIRA access to trusted groups only.

#### Vulnerability

After a JIRA instance has been setup, the first page of the Setup Wizard can still be accessed by manually browsing to the URL.

Attempting to advance beyond this screen, or import data, correctly results in the "Already Setup" page being displayed. However, the default language for the JIRA instance can be modified without any security checks.

#### Fix

The fix is to check that JIRA has not already been setup, when a user attempts to access the any page of the Setup Wizard. Similar checks also occur when a user attempts direct access to the setup JSPs.

This issue has been fixed in [JIRA 3.12.1](/jira/jira-3-12-1-release-notes-112853953.html). The fix is also provided as a patch for JIRA 3.11 and 3.10.2. For more information, please see [JRA-14086](http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-14086).
