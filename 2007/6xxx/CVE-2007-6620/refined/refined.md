Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-6620:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `joovili.images.php` script. The `picture` parameter is vulnerable to path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (also known as Directory Traversal):** The application does not properly validate or sanitize user input, specifically the `picture` parameter, allowing an attacker to navigate the file system outside of the intended directory using relative path sequences like `../`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote File Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script (`joovili.images.php`) with a manipulated `picture` parameter. This parameter contains directory traversal sequences to access files outside the web root.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any prior authentication, meaning it can be exploited by anyone who can access the server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit-db entry mentions both `include/images.inc.php` and `joovili.images.php` being vulnerable. It specifies that versions 2.x.x are vulnerable in the `include/images.inc.php` file, and version 3.x.x are vulnerable in the `joovili.images.php` file.
- The provided exploit examples demonstrate the ability to read the `/etc/passwd` file, which could leak user information on the server.
- The `thumbnail=FALSE` parameter is included to prevent the script from performing operations on the revealed file as if it was an image, therefore only revealing its content.
- The entry includes a "dork" (Google search query) to help find instances of vulnerable software.
- This CVE is mentioned as being related to CVE-2007-6621 on Exploit-DB.
