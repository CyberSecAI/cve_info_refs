Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-6310:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper input sanitization within the Falt4 CMS application. Specifically, the `nav_ID` parameter in `index.php` and the `handler` parameter in `index.php` and `topic` parameter in `modules/feed/feed.php` are not sanitized before being used in queries or displayed on a webpage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The `nav_ID` parameter in the `index.php` script is vulnerable to blind SQL injection attacks due to lack of sanitization.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `handler` parameter in `index.php` and `topic` parameter in `modules/feed/feed.php` are vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** By crafting a malicious SQL query within the `nav_ID` parameter in `index.php`
    * Example URL: `http://www.EXAMPLE.com/falt4/index.php?handler=cat&nav_ID=1'%20and%20'1'='1`
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:**
    *   By injecting malicious scripts into the `handler` parameter of `index.php`
        *   Example URL: `http://www.EXAMPLE.com/falt4/index.php?handler=>"><script>alert(3)</script>&nav_ID=1`
    *   By injecting malicious scripts into the `topic` parameter of `modules/feed/feed.php`
        *   Example URL: `http://www.EXAMPLE.com/falt4/modules/feed/feed.php?type=rss&lang=1&topic=>"><script>alert(2)</script>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Falt4 CMS application. No specific positioning is mentioned, implying the vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerabilities, they can be exploited by sending a crafted request.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Mesut Timur of H-Security Labs.
*   A fix was released by the vendor on December 5, 2007 and public disclosure occurred on December 10, 2007.
*   The advisory suggests updating the files: `/yourfalt4/index.php`, `/yourfalt4/modules/feed.php`, `/yourfalt4/admin/index.php`.
*   The vulnerability was found in Falt4 CMS (RC4 10.9.2007)
