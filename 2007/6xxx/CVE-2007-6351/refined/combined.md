How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# libexif: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200712-15**

Two vulnerabilities in libexif possibly allow for the execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/libexif** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.6.16-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.6.16-r1** |

### Background

libexif is a library for parsing, editing and saving Exif metadata from
images. Exif, the Exchangeable image file format, specifies the
addition of metadata tags to JPEG, TIFF and RIFF files.

### Description

Meder Kydyraliev (Google Security) discovered an integer overflow
vulnerability in the exif\_data\_load\_data\_thumbnail() function leading
to a memory corruption (CVE-2007-6352) and an infinite recursion in the
exif\_loader\_write() function (CVE-2007-6351).

### Impact

An attacker could entice the user of an application making use of
libexif to load an image file with specially crafted Exif tags,
possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application or a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libexif users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libexif-0.6.16-r1"
```

Package        : libexif
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-2645 CVE-2007-6351 CVE-2007-6352

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the EXIF parsing code
of the libexif library, which can lead to denial of service or the
xecution of arbitrary code if a user is tricked into opening a
malformed image.

CVE-2007-2645

    Victor Stinner discovered an integer overflow, which may result in
    denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-6351

    Meder Kydyraliev discovered an infinite loop, which may result in
    denial of service.

CVE-2007-6352

    Victor Stinner discovered an integer overflow, which may result
    in denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary
    code.

This update also fixes two potential NULL pointer deferences.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.13-5etch2.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been
fixed in 0.6.9-6sarge2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libexif packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-654-1: libexif vulnerabilities

14 October 2008

libexif vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [libexif](/security/cves?package=libexif) -

## Details

Meder Kydyraliev discovered that libexif did not correctly handle certain

EXIF headers. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing

a specially crafted image, a remote attacker could cause the application

linked against libexif to crash, leading to a denial of service, or

possibly executing arbitrary code with user privileges.
