{
  "CVE-2007-6430": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient validation of database-based registrations when host-based authentication is used without a password.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authentication bypass due to lack of IP address check when a valid username is provided and no password is required for database-based registrations.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can bypass authentication and potentially hijack user sessions.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote network access.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have knowledge of a valid username within the Asterisk system and target a configuration using database-based registration and host-based authentication without a password."
