Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-6526:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the `tiki-special_chars.php` script of Tikiwiki. Specifically, the `area_name` parameter is not properly sanitized before being returned to the user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code through the `area_name` parameter, which is then executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session.
*   This can be used to steal browser session data or cookies within the context of the affected website.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious payload in the `area_name` variable within a URL targeting `tiki-special_chars.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious `area_name` parameter that targets a vulnerable Tikiwiki installation.
* No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable code is located between lines 166-168 of `tiki-special_chars.php`.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Mesut Timur from H-Labs.
*   A fix is included in Tikiwiki version 1.9.9, released on December 22, 2007.
*   A temporary workaround is mentioned which suggests either disabling or deleting the `tiki-special_chars.php` file if an upgrade to 1.9.9 cannot be performed.
