How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Linux kernel in the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9
Service Pack 4 was released to fix various bugs and also some security
problems:
CVE-2007-6716: Zero the struct dio with kzalloc instead of doing
it member-wise, this could have leaked information from the kernel.
CVE-2008-3525: Added missing capability checks in sbni\_ioctl().
CVE-2008-0598: On AMD64 some string operations could leak kernel
information into user space.
CVE-2008-1673: Added range checking in ASN.1 handling for the CIFS and
SNMP NAT netfilter modules.
CVE-2008-3272: Fixed range checking in the snd\_seq OSS ioctl, which
could be used to leak information from the kernel.
CVE-2008-2812: Various NULL ptr checks have been added to tty op
functions, which might have been used by local attackers to execute
code. We think that this affects only devices openable by root, so the
impact is limited.
More details are available in the package changelog.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot your machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Package        : linux-2.6
Vulnerability  : denial of service/privilege escalation
Problem type   : local/remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-6716 CVE-2008-1514 CVE-2008-3276 CVE-2008-3525
                 CVE-2008-3833 CVE-2008-4210 CVE-2008-4302

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2007-6716

    Joe Jin reported a local denial of service vulnerability that
    allows system users to trigger an oops due to an improperly
    initialized data structure.

CVE-2008-1514

    Jan Kratochvil reported a local denial of service vulnerability in
    the ptrace interface for the s390 architecture. Local users can
    trigger an invalid pointer dereference, leading to a system panic.

CVE-2008-3276

    Eugene Teo reported an integer overflow in the DCCP subsystem that
    may allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service in the
    form of a kernel panic.

CVE-2008-3525

    Eugene Teo reported a lack of capability checks in the kernel
    driver for Granch SBNI12 leased line adapters (sbni), allowing
    local users to perform privileged operations.

CVE-2008-3833

    The S_ISUID/S_ISGID bits were not being cleared during an inode
    splice, which, under certain conditions, can be exploited by local
    users to obtain the privileges of a group for which they are not a
    member. Mark Fasheh reported this issue.

CVE-2008-4210

    David Watson reported an issue in the open()/creat() system calls
    which, under certain conditions, can be exploited by local users
    to obtain the privileges of a group for which they are not a
    member.

CVE-2008-4302

    A coding error in the splice subsystem allows local users to
    attempt to unlock a page structure that has not been locked,
    resulting in a system crash.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.18.dfsg.1-22etch3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6, fai-kernels, and
user-mode-linux packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatability with or to take advantage of this update:

                                             Debian 4.0 (etch)
     fai-kernels                             1.17+etch.22etch3
     user-mode-linux                         2.6.18-1um-2etch.22etch3

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The openSUSE 10.3 kernel was update to 2.6.22.19. This includes bugs
and security fixes.
CVE-2008-4576: Fixed a crash in SCTP INIT-ACK, on mismatch between
SCTP AUTH availability. This might be exploited remotely for a denial
of service (crash) attack.
CVE-2008-3528: The ext[234] filesystem code fails to properly handle
corrupted data structures. With a mounted filesystem image or partition
that have corrupted dir->i\_size and dir->i\_blocks, a user performing
either a read or write operation on the mounted image or partition
can lead to a possible denial of service by spamming the logfile.
CVE-2007-6716: fs/direct-io.c in the dio subsystem in the Linux kernel
did not properly zero out the dio struct, which allows local users
to cause a denial of service (OOPS), as demonstrated by a certain
fio test.
CVE-2008-3525: Added missing capability checks in sbni\_ioctl().
CVE-2008-3272: Fixed range checking in the snd\_seq OSS ioctl, which
could be used to leak information from the kernel.
CVE-2008-3276: An integer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel
dccp\_setsockopt\_change() function. An attacker may leverage this
vulnerability to trigger a kernel panic on a victim's machine remotely.
CVE-2008-1673: Added range checking in ASN.1 handling for the CIFS
and SNMP NAT netfilter modules.
CVE-2008-2826: A integer overflow in SCTP was fixed, which might have
been used by remote attackers to crash the machine or potentially
execute code.
CVE-2008-2812: Various NULL ptr checks have been added to tty op
functions, which might have been used by local attackers to execute
code. We think that this affects only devices openable by root,
so the impact is limited.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart your machine after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=461082#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2008-09-04 02:36:52 UTC  ``` Description of problem: To avoid exposing ourselves to the risk of finding another field like .map_bh.b_state where we rely on zeroing but don't enforce it in the code. The fix uses kzalloc to zero all the struct dio rather than manually trying to track which fields we rely on being zero.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This kernel update for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 Service Pack 2 fixes
various bugs and some security problems:
CVE-2008-4210: When creating a file, open()/creat() allowed the setgid
bit to be set via the mode argument even when, due to the bsdgroups
mount option or the file being created in a setgid directory, the new
file's group is one which the user is not a member of. The local
attacker could then use ftruncate() and memory-mapped I/O to turn
the new file into an arbitrary binary and thus gain the privileges
of this group, since these operations do not clear the setgid bit."
CVE-2008-3528: The ext[234] filesystem code fails to properly handle
corrupted data structures. With a mounted filesystem image or partition
that have corrupted dir->i\_size and dir->i\_blocks, a user performing
either a read or write operation on the mounted image or partition
can lead to a possible denial of service by spamming the logfile.
CVE-2008-1514: The S/390 ptrace code allowed local users to cause
a denial of service (kernel panic) via the user-area-padding test
from the ptrace test suite in 31-bit mode, which triggers an invalid
dereference.
CVE-2007-6716: fs/direct-io.c in the dio subsystem in the Linux kernel
did not properly zero out the dio struct, which allows local users
to cause a denial of service (OOPS), as demonstrated by a certain
fio test.
CVE-2008-3525: Added missing capability checks in sbni\_ioctl().
Also OCFS2 was updated to version v1.4.1-1.
The full amount of changes can be reviewed in the RPM changelog.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart the computer after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

## Details

It was discovered that the direct-IO subsystem did not correctly validate

certain structures. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a system

crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-6716](/security/CVE-2007-6716))

It was discovered that the disabling of the ZERO\_PAGE optimization could

lead to large memory consumption. A local attacker could exploit this to

allocate all available memory, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2008-2372](/security/CVE-2008-2372))

It was discovered that the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) did

not correctly validate its arguments. If DCCP was in use, a remote attacker

could send specially crafted network traffic and cause a system crash,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-3276](/security/CVE-2008-3276))

It was discovered that the SBNI WAN driver did not correctly check for the

NET\_ADMIN capability. A malicious local root user lacking CAP\_NET\_ADMIN

would be able to change the WAN device configuration, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2008-3525](/security/CVE-2008-3525))

It was discovered that the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) did

not correctly validate the key length in the SCTP\_AUTH\_KEY option. If SCTP

is in use, a remote attacker could send specially crafted network traffic

that would crash the system, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2008-3526](/security/CVE-2008-3526))

It was discovered that the tmpfs implementation did not correctly handle

certain sequences of inode operations. A local attacker could exploit this

to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-3534](/security/CVE-2008-3534))

It was discovered that the readv/writev functions did not correctly handle

certain sequences of file operations. A local attacker could exploit this

to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-3535](/security/CVE-2008-3535))

It was discovered that SCTP did not correctly validate its userspace

arguments. A local attacker could call certain sctp\_\* functions with

malicious options and cause a system crash, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2008-3792](/security/CVE-2008-3792), [CVE-2008-4113](/security/CVE-2008-4113), [CVE-2008-4445](/security/CVE-2008-4445))

It was discovered the the i915 video driver did not correctly validate

memory addresses. A local attacker could exploit this to remap memory

that could cause a system crash, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2008-3831](/security/CVE-2008-3831))

Johann Dahm and David Richter discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly

handle certain file ACLs. If NFSv4 is in use, a local attacker could create

a malicious ACL that could cause a system crash, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2008-3915](/security/CVE-2008-3915))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: For systems without the hardy-updates pocket enabled, the 8.04

kernel update will include an unavoidable ABI change. The kernel update

has been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-386,

linux-powerpc, linux-amd64-generic), a standard system upgrade will

automatically perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This patch updates the SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SP1 kernel. It
fixes various bugs and security issues. The released version is
2.6.16.54-0.2.12.
Following security issues are addressed:
CVE-2008-4210: fs/open.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.22 does not
properly strip setuid and setgid bits when there is a write to a
file, which allows local users to gain the privileges of a different
group, and obtain sensitive information or possibly have unspecified
other impact, by creating an executable file in a setgid directory
through the (1) truncate or (2) ftruncate function in conjunction
with memory-mapped I/O.
CVE-2008-3528: The ext[234] filesystem code fails to properly handle
corrupted data structures. With a mounted filesystem image or partition
that have corrupted dir->i\_size and dir->i\_blocks, a user performing
either a read or write operation on the mounted image or partition
can lead to a possible denial of service by spamming the logfile.
CVE-2007-6716: fs/direct-io.c in the dio subsystem in the Linux kernel
did not properly zero out the dio struct, which allows local users
to cause a denial of service (OOPS), as demonstrated by a certain
fio test.
All other bugfixes can be found by looking at the RPM changelog.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- apache2
The security update of apache2 released at 2008/11/05 packages its modules
differently (/usr/lib/apache2-prefork vs. /usr/lib/apache2-worker). This
can, in seldom cases, cause a services (like iPrint) stop working if it
expects the modules in a special directory.
New packages will be released as soon as possible.
- ipsec-tools
Remote attackers could exploit memory leaks in the 'racoon' daemon
to crash it (CVE-2008-3651, CVE-2008-3652)
Affected products: all
- kernel-bigsmp
This kernel update fixes various bugs and also several security issues:
CVE-2008-4576: Fixed a crash in SCTP INIT-ACK, on mismatch between SCTP
AUTH availability. This might be exploited remotely for a denial of
service (crash) attack.
CVE-2008-3833: The generic\_file\_splice\_write function in fs/splice.c
in the Linux kernel does not properly strip setuid and setgid bits
when there is a write to a file, which allows local users to gain the
privileges of a different group, and obtain sensitive information or
possibly have unspecified other impact, by splicing into an inode in
order to create an executable file in a setgid directory.
CVE-2008-4210: fs/open.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.22 does not
properly strip setuid and setgid bits when there is a write to a file,
which allows local users to gain the privileges of a different group, and
obtain sensitive information or possibly have unspecified other impact,
by creating an executable file in a setgid directory through the (1)
truncate or (2) ftruncate function in conjunction with memory-mapped I/O.
CVE-2008-4302: fs/splice.c in the splice subsystem in the Linux
kernel before 2.6.22.2 does not properly handle a failure of the
add\_to\_page\_cache\_lru function, and subsequently attempts to unlock a page
that was not locked, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
(kernel BUG and system crash), as demonstrated by the fio I/O tool.
CVE-2008-3528: The ext[234] filesystem code fails to properly handle
corrupted data structures. With a mounted filesystem image or partition
that have corrupted dir->i\_size and dir->i\_blocks, a user performing
either a read or write operation on the mounted image or partition can
lead to a possible denial of service by spamming the logfile.
CVE-2007-6716: fs/direct-io.c in the dio subsystem in the Linux kernel
did not properly zero out the dio struct, which allows local users to
cause a denial of service (OOPS), as demonstrated by a certain fio test.
CVE-2008-3525: Added missing capability checks in sbni\_ioctl().
CVE-2008-3272: Fixed range checking in the snd\_seq OSS ioctl, which
could be used to leak information from the kernel.
CVE-2008-2931: The do\_change\_type function in fs/namespace.c did not
verify that the caller has the CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN capability, which allows
local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service by modifying
the properties of a mountpoint.
CVE-2008-2812: Various NULL ptr checks have been added to tty op
functions, which might have been used by local attackers to execute
code. We think that this affects only devices openable by root, so the
impact is limited.
CVE-2008-1673: Added range checking in ASN.1 handling for the CIFS and
SNMP NAT netfilter modules.
CVE-2008-3527: arch/i386/kernel/sysenter.c in the Virtual Dynamic Shared
Objects (vDSO) implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.21 did not
properly check boundaries, which allows local users to gain privileges
or cause a denial of service via unspecified vectors, related to the
install\_special\_mapping, syscall, and syscall32\_nopage functions.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2
- flash-player
This update of flash-player fixes several critical security vulner-
abilities that couls lead to remote system compromise.
(CVE-2007-6243, CVE-2008-3873, CVE-2007-4324, CVE-2008-4401,
CVE-2008-4503, CVE-2008-4546)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.2-11.0, Novell Linux Desktop 9,
SLED 10 SP1 and SP2
- mysql
Empty bit-strings in a query could crash the MySQL server (CVE-2008-3963).
Due to another flaw users could access tables of other users (CVE-2008-
4097, CVE-2008-4098).
Affected products: all (so far only released for SLES10, others will
follow)
- ktorrent

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=463661#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2008-09-24 05:40:37 UTC  ``` Description of problem: When creating a file, open()/creat() allows the setgid bit to be set via the mode argument even when, due to the bsdgroups mount option or the file being created in a setgid directory, the new file's group is one which the user is not a member of.  The user can then use ftruncate() and memory-mapped I/O to turn the new file into an arbitrary binary and thus gain the privileges of this group, since these operations do not clear the setgid bit.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=463661#c1)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2008-09-24 06:06:59 UTC  ``` Reference: <http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8420>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=463661#c2)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2008-09-24 06:13:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 317560](attachment.cgi?id=317560 "Reproducer (public)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=317560&action=edit "Reproducer (public)") Reproducer (public)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=463661#c7)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2008-09-24 10:30:34 UTC  ``` Proposed upstream patch: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=7b82dc0e64e93f430182f36b46b79fcee87d3532>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=463661#c8)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2008-09-24 10:37:04 UTC  ``` Additional references: <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/974>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=463661#c13)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2008-09-26 04:02:39 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=463661#c7)) > Proposed upstream patch: > <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=7b82dc0e64e93f430182f36b46b79fcee87d3532>  This should include commit 01de85e057328ecbef36e108673b1e81059d54c1 as well.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=463661#c18)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2008-10-07 01:14:28 UTC  ``` <http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=101812479210977&w=2>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=463661#c19)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2008-10-07 01:18:39 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=463661#c18)) > <http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=101812479210977&w=2>  More references: <http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=101811359004161&w=2> <http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=101811887207549&w=2>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=463661#c21)  Buck Huppmann    2008-11-12 22:44:04 UTC  ``` is there a RHSA coming for this for RH 4, a la  <http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2008-0957.html>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=463661#c24)  Vincent Danen    2010-12-21 17:41:49 UTC  ``` This was addressed via:  Red Hat Linux Advanced Workstation 2.1 (RHSA-2008:0787) Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 5 (RHSA-2008:0957) Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 4 (RHSA-2008:0972) Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 3 (RHSA-2008:0973) Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 2.1 (RHSA-2009:0001)   ``` |  |

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that resolve several security issues and fix
various bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* a flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Direct-IO implementation. This

could have allowed a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2007-6716, Important)

* when running ptrace in 31-bit mode on an IBM S/390 or IBM System z

kernel, a local unprivileged user could cause a denial of service by
reading from or writing into a padding area in the user\_regs\_struct32
structure. (CVE-2008-1514, Important)

* the do\_truncate() and generic\_file\_splice\_write() functions did not clear

the setuid and setgid bits. This could have allowed a local unprivileged
user to obtain access to privileged information. (CVE-2008-4210, Important)

* Tobias Klein reported a missing check in the Linux kernel's Open Sound

System (OSS) implementation. This deficiency could have led to an
information leak. (CVE-2008-3272, Moderate)

* a potential denial of service attack was discovered in the Linux kernel's

PWC USB video driver. A local unprivileged user could have used this flaw
to bring the kernel USB subsystem into the busy-waiting state.
(CVE-2007-5093, Low)

* the ext2 and ext3 file systems code failed to properly handle corrupted

data structures, leading to a possible local denial of service issue when
read or write operations were performed. (CVE-2008-3528, Low)

In addition, these updated packages fix the following bugs:

* when using the CIFS "forcedirectio" option, appending to an open file on

a CIFS share resulted in that file being overwritten with the data to be
appended.

* a kernel panic occurred when a device with PCI ID 8086:10c8 was present

on a system with a loaded ixgbe driver.

* due to an aacraid driver regression, the kernel failed to boot when trying

to load the aacraid driver and printed the following error message:
"aac\_srb: aac\_fib\_send failed with status: 8195".

* due to an mpt driver regression, when RAID 1 was configured on Primergy

systems with an LSI SCSI IME 53C1020/1030 controller, the kernel panicked
during boot.

* the mpt driver produced a large number of extraneous debugging messages

when performing a "Host reset" operation.

* due to a regression in the sym driver, the kernel panicked when a SCSI

hot swap was performed using MCP18 hardware.

* all cores on a multi-core system now scale their frequencies in

accordance with the policy set by the system's CPU frequency governor.

* the netdump subsystem suffered from several stability issues. These are

addressed in this updated kernel.

* under certain conditions, the ext3 file system reported a negative count

of used blocks.

* reading /proc/self/mem incorrectly returned "Invalid argument" instead of

"input/output error" due to a regression.

* under certain conditions, the kernel panicked when a USB device was

removed while the system was busy accessing the device.

* a race condition in the kernel could have led to a kernel crash during

the creation of a new process.

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Users should upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE request: kernel: dio: zero struct dio with kzalloc instead of
 manually

Hi Steve,

Is this assigned with a CVE name already? If not, please allocate one.

This upstream commit addressed a user triggerable DoS:
848c4dd5153c7a0de55470ce99a8e13a63b4703f

Summary:
[PATCH] dio: zero struct dio with kzalloc instead of manually

To avoid exposing ourselves to the risk of finding another field like
.map_bh.b_state where we rely on zeroing but don't enforce it in the
code. The fix uses kzalloc to zero all the struct dio rather than
manually trying to track which fields we rely on being zero.

Reproducer:
<http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/30/448>

Thanks, Eugene

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The fix uses kzalloc to zero all the struct dio rather than manually trying to track which fields we rely on being zero.

On 2.6.18-92.1.13, the same happens.  the steps are as follows: 1. download fio-1.21.tar.[bz2](show_bug.cgi?id=2 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - broken links of default index.html") from <http://freshmeat.net/projects/fio/> and extract the file to /root/kzhang/fio directory 2. make & make install 3. download jobfile from <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=315718> 4. change the directory=/root/kzhang/fio 5. ./fio jobfile  the system would kernel panic, following is the backtrace.
