  "CVE-2007-6306": {
    "description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the image map feature in JFreeChart 1.0.8 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) chart name or (2) chart tool tip text; or the (3) href, (4) shape, or (5) coords attribute of a chart area.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The JFreeChart library fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data when generating HTML image maps.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into a web page that displays a JFreeChart. This can lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, defacement, or the execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker must be able to control the chart name or tool tip text, or the href, shape, or coords attributes of a chart area used by JFreeChart to generate an image map."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide malicious input that's used to generate a chart with an image map. Depending on the usage, this might involve an attacker directly providing input or exploiting a different vulnerability that allows them to control such data."
