How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# exiftags: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200712-17**

Multiple vulnerabilities in exiftags possibly allow for the execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/exiftags** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.01** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.01** |

### Background

exiftags is a library and set of tools for parsing, editing and saving
Exif metadata from images. Exif, the Exchangeable image file format,
specifies the addition of metadata tags to JPEG, TIFF and RIFF files.

### Description

Meder Kydyraliev (Google Security) discovered that Exif metadata is not
properly sanitized before being processed, resulting in illegal memory
access in the postprop() and other functions (CVE-2007-6354). He also
discovered integer overflow vulnerabilities in the parsetag() and other
functions (CVE-2007-6355) and an infinite recursion in the readifds()
function caused by recursive IFD references (CVE-2007-6356).

### Impact

An attacker could entice the user of an application making use of
exiftags or an application included in exiftags to load an image file
with specially crafted Exif tags, possibly resulting in the execution
of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application or a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All exiftags users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/exiftags-1.01"
```

Package        : exiftags
Vulnerability  : insufficient input sanitizing
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-6354 CVE-2007-6355 CVE-2007-6356
Debian Bug     : 457062

Christian Schmid and Meder Kydyraliev (Google Security) discovered a
number of vulnerabilities in exiftags, a utility for extracting EXIF
metadata from JPEG images. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identified the following three problems:

CVE-2007-6354

    Inadequate EXIF property validation could lead to invalid memory
    accesses if executed on a maliciously crafted image, potentially
    including heap corruption and the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-6355

    Flawed data validation could lead to integer overflows, causing
    other invalid memory accesses, also with the potential for memory
    corruption or arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2007-6356

    Cyclical EXIF image file directory (IFD) references could cause
    a denial of service (infinite loop).

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.98-1.1+etch1.

The old stable distribution (sarge) cannot be fixed synchronously
with the Etch version due to a technical limitation in the Debian
archive management scripts.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.01-0.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your exiftags package.

Debian 4.0 (stable)
- -------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.
