  "CVE-2007-6694": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "Multiple sources",
      "CWE": "CWE-476",
      "Description": "A possible NULL pointer dereference was found in the chrp_show_cpuinfo function when using the PowerPC architecture. This may have allowed a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service (crash)."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a NULL pointer dereference within the `chrp_show_cpuinfo` function on PowerPC (CHRP) platforms. The function attempts to use the `model` string obtained from `of_get_property` without checking if `of_get_property` succeeded in retrieving the `model` property.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "NULL pointer dereference"
      ],
      "Impact": "A local unprivileged user can trigger a denial-of-service (system crash).",
      "Attack vector": "Local access to the system.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local, unprivileged user."
    },
    "Affected_components": [
      "Linux kernel on PowerPC (CHRP) platforms."

     "Patches": [
        {

           "Description": "Updated kernel packages that fix the vulnerability."
