  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Incorrect bounds checking in the httpHeaderUpdate() function when processing cache update replies within the Squid Proxy server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect bounds checking",
      "Memory leak vulnerability",
      "Denial of service due to memory exhaustion"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause the Squid proxy server to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition. If the proxy is used as a reverse proxy, it may also affect the web servers relying on it. Specially crafted requests can also cause high CPU usage.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attack via network access to the Squid proxy",
      "Specially crafted HTTP requests"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the Squid proxy server. They need to be a trusted client or have network access to the proxy.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability can lead to a memory leak when performing cache updates. The issue was initially fixed in Squid version 2.6.STABLE17 but that fix was incomplete, the full fix arrived with Squid version 2.6.STABLE18.  The vulnerability was discovered by the Wikimedia Foundation."
