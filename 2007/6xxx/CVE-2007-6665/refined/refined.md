- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `admin/login.asp` page of the oneSCHOOL application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass authentication and extract sensitive information (usernames and passwords) from the `UsersSecure` table.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `admin/login.asp` page with a malicious SQL query injected into the `txtLoginID` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special privileges.
