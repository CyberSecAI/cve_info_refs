Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `search.php` file of PHCDownload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `search.php` script is vulnerable to XSS. This occurs because user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being included in the output page.
*   **Possible SQL Injection:** The blog post also mentions a "posible SQL injection", indicating that the lack of sanitization might extend to database queries, but this is not confirmed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the search results page. This allows them to:
    *   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they view the search results page.
    *   Potentially steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim within the context of the vulnerable web application.
*   **SQL Injection (Potential):** If SQL injection is possible, an attacker could:
    *   Access, modify, or delete sensitive database information.
    *   Potentially take complete control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** The attacker would craft a malicious search query containing JavaScript code, e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, and then trick a user into executing the search on the vulnerable site.
*   **SQL Injection (Potential):** An attacker could inject SQL code into the search parameter and potentially manipulate the underlying database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the `search.php` functionality of PHCDownload.
*   The attacker must be able to craft malicious input that is not properly sanitized by the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**
* The blog post was written in 2007, and this exploit is likely for an older version of the software.

**Summary of CVE-2007-6669:**

The provided content from lostmon.blogspot.com indicates that the root cause of the vulnerability is insufficient input sanitization in `search.php` of PHCDownload, leading to XSS and possible SQL injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these weaknesses by injecting malicious code into the search query, leading to the execution of malicious scripts in a victim's browser or manipulation of the database. The attacker needs to access the search functionality and craft a specific input to exploit the vulnerability.
