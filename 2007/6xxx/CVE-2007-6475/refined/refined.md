Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is improper input validation and sanitization in the gf-3xplorer 2.4 application. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to:

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `lang_sel` parameter in `updater.php` and `thumber.php` is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include local files. The exploit uses a null byte (`%00`) to truncate the file path, effectively bypassing checks.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `newdir` parameter in `index_3x.php` is also vulnerable to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   Lack of proper input sanitization for the `lang_sel` parameter.
    *   Failure to validate the provided path, allowing access to arbitrary files within the server's filesystem.
    *   Vulnerability to null byte injection (`%00`) to terminate the file path prematurely.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Lack of proper input sanitization for the `newdir` parameter in `index_3x.php`.
    *   Allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **LFI:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive system files, configuration files, source code, or database credentials, leading to information disclosure and potential further attacks.
*   **XSS:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **LFI:**
    *   HTTP GET request to `updater.php` or `thumber.php` with a malicious `lang_sel` parameter.
    *   Example: `http://[site]/[path]/updater.php?lang_sel=[LFI]%00`
*   **XSS:**
    *   HTTP GET request to `index_3x.php` with a malicious `newdir` parameter.
    *   Example: `http://[site]/[path]/index_3x.php?newdir=">[Xss]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
*   No authentication is mentioned as being required to exploit the described vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable files within the web application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content also mentions a `phpinfo()` page accessible at `http://[site]/GF-3XPLORER/explorer/phpinfo.php`, which could further aid an attacker in gathering system information.
*   The application has `magic_quotes_gpc` set to "Off," which simplifies LFI attacks.
*   This exploit information is more detailed than the information provided in the CVE description.
