      "source": "aluigi.altervista.org_81323e50_20250124_223732.html",
      "details": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in BadBlue web server versions 2.72b and earlier.\n\n**A) PassThru buffer overflow:**\n  - **Root cause:** When the `PassThru` command of `ext.dll` is invoked, the server copies the remaining part of the URI received from the client into a 4096-byte stack buffer using `strcpy()`. This leads to a buffer overflow if the URI exceeds the buffer size.\n  - **Weakness:** Use of `strcpy()` without bounds checking.\n  - **Impact:** Remote code execution (likely), denial of service.\n  - **Attack vector:** Sending a specially crafted HTTP request with an overly long URI.\n  - **Attacker capabilities:** Remote attacker, no authentication required.\n\n**B) Upload directory traversal:**\n  - **Root cause:** The upload feature allows an attacker to upload files outside the designated folder.\n  - **Weakness:** Lack of proper sanitization and validation of file paths during upload.\n  - **Impact:** Overwriting arbitrary files, including the server's configuration file (`ext.ini`), potentially leading to complete server compromise.\n  - **Attack vector:** Sending a specially crafted upload request with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the filename.\n  - **Attacker capabilities:** Remote attacker, possibly no authentication required (not specified).\n\n**C) Path disclosure:**\n  - **Root cause:** The server discloses its full path when using the `?&browse=` parameter on a non-existent folder.\n  - **Weakness:** Improper error handling that leaks internal path information.\n  - **Impact:** Information disclosure that can be useful for further attacks, especially in conjunction with the upload directory traversal vulnerability.\n  - **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with the `?&browse=` parameter to a non-existent folder.\n   - **Attacker capabilities:** Remote attacker, no authentication required."
