The provided content discusses multiple issues related to X.509 certificate handling in web browsers, focusing on how these issues can be exploited for phishing attacks through certificate spoofing. The primary vulnerability discussed, and the one most relevant to CVE-2007-6591, is the lack of binding between user-approved certificates and the originating hostname.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The core issue is that some browsers fail to properly bind user-approved certificates to the specific hostname they were initially presented for. This means that once a user accepts a certificate from an unknown CA for one site, an attacker can reuse that certificate on a different site. The browser, having previously accepted the cert, will then trust the connection even if it's to a completely different site than what the certificate is intended for.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **No Cert-Name Binding:** The primary weakness is the failure to bind a user-approved certificate to the originating hostname. This allows certificate reuse for different hosts.
*   **SubjectAltName Not Shown:**  Browsers do not prominently display `subjectAltName` fields. This makes it difficult for users to detect that a certificate is valid for multiple domains, increasing the chances of unnoticed spoofing.
*   **Loose Wildcard Matching:** Some browsers perform "loose matching" of wildcards in certificates, violating RFC 2818. For instance, they might accept a certificate for "\*" or "\*.com" as valid for any domain, allowing for broad spoofing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Certificate Spoofing:** An attacker can reuse a certificate that a user previously accepted (even for a completely different domain) to impersonate a legitimate website.
*   **Phishing:** The attacker can present a spoofed HTTPS website with a valid-looking certificate, tricking the user into believing they are on a legitimate website. This can lead to the user giving up sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** An attacker could intercept the user's traffic and present a spoofed server with a reused certificate that the browser already trusts.
*   **Compromised Certificate Authority:** An attacker could compromise a CA and issue a certificate with a very broad wildcard like `*.com`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs a certificate that was previously accepted by the victim's browser for *any* website.
*   The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or redirect the victim's traffic (e.g., MITM attack, DNS spoofing).

**Additional Notes:**
* The document highlights that Mozilla-based browsers, Konqueror, and Safari 2 were initially affected by the `no-cert-name-binding` vulnerability. Later versions of Mozilla (>=1.9 M9) incorporated fixes that bind certificates to hostnames.
* The document provides a detailed explanation of the subjectAltName field, and how it relates to the discussed weaknesses, and mentions that most browsers don't display this field properly.
* The document also addresses issues with wildcard matching and certificate storage in various browsers.

The content is very relevant to CVE-2007-6591, which relates to certificate spoofing due to a lack of proper hostname binding. The content gives a detailed explanation of how that vulnerability can be achieved as well as other related issues.
