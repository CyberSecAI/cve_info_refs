Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-6600:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how PostgreSQL handles functions within index expressions. Specifically, during `VACUUM` and `ANALYZE` operations, index functions are executed as the superuser instead of the table owner. This allows for the possibility of privilege escalation.
*   Additionally, the ability to use `SET ROLE` and `SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION` within index functions further exacerbates the problem, allowing attackers to potentially assume other user roles.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incorrect Privilege Handling:** Index functions were executed with superuser privileges when they should have been executed with the privileges of the table owner.
*   **Unrestricted Functionality:** The ability to use `SET ROLE` and `SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION` within index functions was not properly controlled, leading to privilege escalation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers could potentially escalate their privileges within the database by creating malicious index functions which use `SET ROLE` and `SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION` when called by VACUUM and ANALYZE.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves creating or modifying database indexes that incorporate malicious functions which use `SET ROLE` and `SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION`.
*   The vulnerability is triggered during `VACUUM` and `ANALYZE` operations which are operations performed by the database.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would require the ability to create and alter indexes with malicious functions.
*   The attacker needs to have a valid database account.
*   The attacker does not need superuser privileges to create such indexes.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is described as local in some of the sources, which means that it could be exploited by users with local database access.
*   The fix requires updating to specific versions of PostgreSQL which address the issue.
*   One of the sources mentioned "expression indexes" which is the specific feature where this vulnerability exists.
*   Another source mentions that this vulnerability is present on all platforms and architectures.

In summary, CVE-2007-6600 is a privilege escalation vulnerability that allows attackers to gain higher database privileges by creating malicious index functions and then triggering them via the VACUUM and ANALYZE functions. The improper privilege handling and unrestricted use of `SET ROLE` and `SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION` are the core issues of this vulnerability.
