Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an insecure `include()` statement in the `frontpage_right.php` file. The script uses a user-supplied parameter `$loadadminpage` without proper sanitization, which allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary remote files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. The script directly includes a file specified by the attacker through the `loadadminpage` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request by manipulating the `loadadminpage` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable path:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable script (`frontpage_right.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`loadadminpage`).
- **Hosting a malicious file:** The attacker needs to host a malicious PHP file on a server accessible to the vulnerable system.
