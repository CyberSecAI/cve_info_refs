Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of user-supplied input in the `resize.php` script of the PictPress WordPress plugin. Specifically, the script directly uses the `path` GET parameter to construct a file path without proper sanitization, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** The core vulnerability is a path traversal issue. The plugin uses user-provided input (`$_GET['path']`) to construct a file path without any validation, allowing attackers to traverse directories outside of the intended cache directory.
    *   **Remote File Disclosure:** The vulnerable code uses the constructed path with `readfile()`, which can lead to the disclosure of arbitrary files on the server.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **File Disclosure:** Attackers can read the content of sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd` or other configuration files. This information could be used to gain further access or compromise the system.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `resize.php` script.
    *   **Path Traversal Payload:** The `path` parameter in the GET request is crafted to contain path traversal sequences like `../../` to access files outside of the intended directory.
    *   **Null Byte Injection:** The provided PoC uses a null byte (`%00`) at the end of the file path, which can be used to truncate the path, preventing the plugin from appending additional information after the user-controlled path.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable WordPress plugin.
    *   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic understanding of HTTP requests, path traversal, and URL encoding to craft the malicious request.

**Summary of Vulnerability Details**
The provided content describes a Remote File Disclosure vulnerability in the WordPress PictPress plugin (version <= 0.91). The `resize.php` script is vulnerable to path traversal because it does not validate the `path` GET parameter which allows attackers to read any file on the system by manipulating this parameter using directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) and null bytes.
