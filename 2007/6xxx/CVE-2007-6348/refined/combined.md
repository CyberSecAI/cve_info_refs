Thanks for the info.  Somebody also provided a similar PoC, and I'm
working on releasing 1.4.13 at the moment to ensure less confusion.

All,

Due to the package compromise of 1.4.11, and 1.4.12, we are forced to
release 1.4.13 to ensure no confusions. While initial review didn't
uncover a need for concern, several proof of concepts show that the
package alterations introduce a high risk security issue, allowing
remote inclusion of files. These changes would allow a remote user the
ability to execute exploit code on a victim machine, without any user
interaction on the victim's server. This could grant the attacker the
ability to deploy further code on the victim's server.

We *STRONGLY* advise all users of 1.4.11, and 1.4.12 upgrade
immediately.

Hash: SHA1

All,

It has been brought to our attention that the MD5 sums for the 1.4.12
package were not matching the actual package.  We've been
investigating this issue, and uncovered that the package was modified
post release.  This was believed to have been caused by a compromised
account from one of our release maintainers.

Further investigations show that the modifications to the code should
have little to no impact at this time.  Modifications seemed to be
based around a PHP global variable which we cannot track down.  The
changes made will most likely generate an error, rather than a
compromise of a system in the event the code does get executed.

Original packages, stored on secure media, have been restored to the
Sourceforge download servers, and additional signatures for the
packages are now available on the SquirrelMail download page at
<http://www.squirrelmail.org/download.php>

While we believe the changes made should have little impact, we
strongly recommend everybody that has downloaded the 1.4.12 package
after the 8th December, to redownload the package.

The code modifications did not made it into our source control, just
the final package.  We are currently investigating older packages to
see if they were also compromised.

Once again, the original package MD5s are:
ea5e750797628c9f0f247009f8ae0e14  squirrelmail-1.4.12.tar.bz2
d17c1d9f1ee3dde2c1c21a22fc4f9d0e  squirrelmail-1.4.12.tar.gz
3f6514939ea1ebf69f6f8c92781886ab  squirrelmail-1.4.12.zip

We apologies for the inconvenience this may have caused.

For any further issues, please contact myself, or the security list

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
