Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-6454:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `handshakeHTTP` function within `servhs.cpp` of PeerCast.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A heap buffer overflow exists due to insufficient bounds checking when handling HTTP requests, specifically `SOURCE` requests.
- The `handshakeHTTP` function copies data from the HTTP request into the `loginPassword` and `loginMount` buffers without proper size validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending a specially crafted, overly long `SOURCE` request.
- The overflow can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server, with the privileges of the user running the PeerCast server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker sends a malicious HTTP `SOURCE` request to the PeerCast server.
- The oversized request overflows the `loginPassword` and `loginMount` buffers on the heap.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PeerCast server.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability if `ALLOW_BROADCAST` is enabled (which is the default).

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects PeerCast versions 0.1217 and earlier, as well as SVN revision 344 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Luigi Auriemma.
- The `ALLOW_BROADCAST` setting, enabled by default, exacerbates the vulnerability.
- Patches and fixes were implemented in PeerCast version 0.1218, SVN revision 347 and in Debian packages `peercast` 0.1217.toots.20060314-1etch0, `gnome-peercast` 0.5.4-1.1etch0 and 0.5.4-1.2.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, and the attack complexity is considered low.
