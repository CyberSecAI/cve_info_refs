Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-6472

**Vulnerable Software:** phpMyRealty 1.0.x

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**  SQL Injection vulnerability in the `search.php` and `findlistings.php` files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:**  Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `type` parameter of `search.php` and the `listing_updated_days` parameter of `findlistings.php`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information such as usernames and passwords from the database (e.g., from `pmr_admins` and `pmr_users` tables).
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to gain administrative access to the application.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable scripts (`search.php` and `findlistings.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** Knowledge of SQL is required to craft the malicious SQL injection payloads.
*  **No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability**

**Technical Details:**

*   The `search.php` file is vulnerable via the `type` parameter. An example exploit is given:
    ```
    www.victim.com/search.php?type=-1+union+select+concat_ws(char(58),login,password)+from+pmr_admins
    www.victim.com/search.php?type=-1+union+select+concat_ws(char(58),login,password)+from+pmr_users
    ```
*   The `findlistings.php` file is vulnerable via the `listing_updated_days` parameter. An example exploit is given:
    ```
    www.victim.com/admin/findlistings.php?listing_updated=YES&listing_updated_days=1)+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4/*
    ```
*   The exploit examples use `UNION SELECT` statements to extract data from the database.
