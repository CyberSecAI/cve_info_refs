Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter in the `leggi_commenti.asp` file. This allows for SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. The `id` parameter, used in a query, isn't properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other potentially confidential information. In this case, the exploit specifically targets the `utenti` table and attempts to retrieve the password and other information for admin users.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `leggi_commenti.asp` file. The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter within the URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application. No special privileges or access to the application's server is required.

**Additional Details:**

The provided exploit example shows how an attacker could use a `UNION SELECT` SQL injection technique to extract data. Specifically the exploit attempts to select password, name, and other fields from the 'utenti' table.

The application is identified as "MWOpen E-Commerce". The vulnerability affects all versions.
