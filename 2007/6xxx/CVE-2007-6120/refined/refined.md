```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Bluetooth SDP dissector in Wireshark can be tricked into an endless loop.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: An infinite loop vulnerability exists in the Bluetooth SDP dissector.
- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering an infinite loop in Wireshark.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted Bluetooth SDP packet.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to send a malformed Bluetooth SDP packet to a system running a vulnerable version of Wireshark. This could be achieved by capturing network traffic or by opening a malformed capture file.
