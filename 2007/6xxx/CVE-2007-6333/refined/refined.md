    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The HP Info Center software contains a vulnerable ActiveX control (HPInfoDLL.dll) with insecure methods.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure methods in the ActiveX control allow for arbitrary registry read/write and remote code execution.",
        "The `LaunchApp` method in the ActiveX control does not properly validate the path, allowing execution of any program on the system.",
        "The ActiveX control is marked as 'Safe for Scripting', enabling full scripting access from a browser."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution, remote system registry read/write access, and remote shell command execution. This can lead to malware installation, sensitive data manipulation, and denial-of-service attacks.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Users are induced to visit a malicious webpage that exploits the ActiveX control.",
        "The exploit leverages the `LaunchApp` method to execute arbitrary programs, including the command shell.",
        "Combining shell access with the ability to hide the command window, an attacker can download and execute arbitrary code remotely without user interaction."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to induce a user with vulnerable software to visit a malicious website.",
          "Exploitation requires no user interaction after the user visits the malicious link.",
          "The attacker needs a server to host the malicious code to be downloaded to the victim's machine."
