  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-6651",
      "description": "Bitweaver R2 CMS has an arbitrary file upload vulnerability. It's possible to upload arbitrary files with image/gif content-type (this can be changed via local proxy or direct content alteration). It is also possible for an attacker to bypass \"/storage/.htaccess\" restriction by uploading their own .htaccess and controlling server settings.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of uploaded file types in `/fisheye/upload.php`. Although there's a check for 'image' or 'pdf' types, this check can be easily bypassed by altering the content-type in the request or through a proxy. Additionally, lack of proper restrictions allows upload of files like `.htaccess` to override server settings.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation",
        "Inadequate File Type Checking",
        "htaccess bypass"
       ],
      "impact": "An attacker can upload malicious files, potentially including scripts that could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server. Furthermore, they can modify server configurations by uploading a custom .htaccess file.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Web interface (file upload)"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface where the file upload functionality is exposed. They need to be able to manipulate the file upload request (for example, using a proxy). No authentication seems to be required."
    },
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-6650",
       "description": "Bitweaver R2 CMS has a source code disclosure vulnerability. By using the 'suck_url' parameter in the `wiki/edit.php` file, an attacker can force the system to read and display the source code of arbitrary local files, such as the config file.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the use of `file_get_contents()` in `/wiki/edit.php` with the `suck_url` parameter which allows an attacker to read arbitrary local files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure Direct Object Reference",
        "Unrestricted URL parameter use"
       ],
      "impact": "An attacker can gain access to sensitive information, including configuration files, potentially leading to full compromise of the application and the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP request to the `wiki/edit.php` file using the `suck_url` parameter"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web application, no authentication required to exploit the vulnerability.  "
