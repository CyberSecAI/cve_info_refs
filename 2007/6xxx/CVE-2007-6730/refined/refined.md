{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ZyXEL P-330W router's web-based management interface lacks proper input validation and cross-site request forgery (XSRF) protection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the web management interface.",
      "Lack of XSRF protection, making the entire web interface vulnerable."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser by exploiting XSS vulnerabilities. Additionally, an attacker can perform unauthorized actions on the router (e.g., enabling remote management, changing passwords) via XSRF attacks if the victim is logged into the router's web interface.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "XSS: Injecting malicious JavaScript code into vulnerable input fields in the web interface.",
       "XSRF: Attacker creates a malicious web page that, when visited by an authenticated user, triggers unauthorized actions on the router."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "For XSS, the attacker needs to identify vulnerable input fields in the routerâ€™s web interface. For XSRF, the attacker needs to lure a logged-in user into visiting a malicious web page. Both attacks require the victim to have an active session with the router."
