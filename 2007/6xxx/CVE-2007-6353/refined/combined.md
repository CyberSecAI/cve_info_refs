# Welcome to the Gentoo wiki!

Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!

## Available documentation

To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the [Documentation topic](#Documentation_topics) links provided below.

Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a *Handbook:* or *Project:* prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective *Discussion* pages.

Find something to add or edit? The [*Getting started*](#Getting_started) section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.

Most importantly, the **Gentoo Handbook** is among the best documents found on the wiki:

 [Gentoo Handbook (Official installation documentation)](/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page "Handbook:Main Page")

Due to usability issues the [visual editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVisualEditor "wikipedia:Wikipedia:VisualEditor") has been temporarily disabled. See [bug #910279](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910279) for more details.
#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- libexiv2 integer overflow problem
Meder Kydyraliev of Google found out that specially crafted
files could trigger an integer overflow in the libexiv2 library,
potentially causing code execution (CVE-2007-6353).
This problem affected openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3, updated packages were
released on December 21st.
- dvips buffer overflows / insecure tempfiles
Buffer overflows in dvips and dviljk could be triggered by specially
crafted dvi files (CVE-2007-5935, CVE-2007-5937).
dvips additionally created temporary files in an insecure manner
(CVE-2007-5936).
Update TeX packages have been released for all affected distributions
except openSUSE 10.3. openSUSE 10.3 texlive packages are still pending
due to unrelated problems.
- libsndfile possible buffer overflow
A possible buffer overflow that occurs while reading decoded PCM
data from the FLAC library was fixed in libsndfile. (CVE-2007-4974)
Updates have been released for all affected distributions containing
libsndfile on January 3rd.
- squid denial of service problem
The web browser squid was updated to fix a denial-of-service bug
during cache update reply processing. (CVE-2007-6239)
Squid has been updated on all SUSE Linux based products on
December 30.
- rsync directory traversal problems
A bug in rsync was fixed that allowed remote attackers to access
restricted files outside a module's hierarchy if no chroot setup
was used. (CVE-2007-6199)
Please also read <http://rsync.samba.org/security.html> entry
from November 28th, 2007 to get more information about a secure
configuration of rsync that also covers the bug tracked with
CVE-2007-6200.
This rsync update also fixes some crashes that only affect rsync-2.6.8
on SLES10.
The update was released on December 22nd.
- clamav 0.92 security update
The virus scan engine clamav was upgrade to 0.92 to fix numerous flaws including
some security problems (CVE-2007-6335, CVE-2007-6336, CVE-2007-6337).
Please note that the version number of the clamav library has
changed. Programs linked against libclamav therefore need to be
updated as well. We released klamav, claws and sylpheed-claws packages to
adjust this.
This update was released on December 20.
- Xen denial of service problems
Various Xen issues have been fixed, two of them security related:
- CVE-2007-5906: Xen allowed virtual guest system users to cause
a denial of service (hypervisor crash) by using a debug register
(DR7) to set certain breakpoints.
- CVE-2007-5907: Xen 3.1.1 does not prevent modification of the CR4
TSC from applications, which allows pv guests to cause a denial
of service (crash).
Updates have been released for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.3 and SUSE
Linux Enterprise Server 10. openSUSE 10.2 updates are still pending.

2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
- libexif vulnerabilities
A Google security audit also found problems in libexif. We are preparing
updates for these issues. (CVE-2007-6351/CVE-2007-6352)
- wireshark 0.99.7 security problems
Multiple bugs were fixed in wireshark 0.99.7, updated packages for these
problems are currently in QA.
- various MySQL security issues
We are currently testing a MySQL update to fix various security issues
discovered.
- krb5 small security issues
We are currently testing fixes for the reported krb5 security issues.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1474-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
January 23, 2008                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : exiv2
Vulnerability  : integer overflow
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-6353

Meder Kydyraliev discovered an integer overflow in the thumbnail
handling of libexif, the EXIF/IPTC metadata manipulation library, which
could result in the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.10-1.5.

The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain exiv2 packages.

We recommend that you upgrade your exiv2 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian (stable)
- ---------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=425921#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2007-12-17 09:07:12 UTC  ``` Meder Kydyraliev reported an integer overflow exiv2's EXIF parsing code resulting in heap buffer oveflow.  This can possibly lead to code execution as user running application using exiv2 library to extract EXIF tags from malicious image files.  Upstream commit: <http://dev.robotbattle.com/~cvsuser/cgi-bin/ns_viewcvs.cgi/exiv2/trunk/src/exif.cpp?rev=1346&r1=1231&r2=1346>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=425921#c1)  Rex Dieter    2007-12-17 14:32:12 UTC  ``` This is (apparently, can't see it yet), the upstream issue tracker: <http://dev.robotbattle.com/bugs/view.php?id=534>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=425921#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2007-12-17 14:49:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=425921#c1)) > <http://dev.robotbattle.com/bugs/view.php?id=534>  Yes it is.  That report was first opened as public and it also contained further details about similar problems in other EXIF parsing libraries (see e.g. our bugs #425551 and #425561 for libexif).      ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=425921#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2007-12-17 14:52:36 UTC  ``` Gentoo bug states that exiv2 did not compile because of incorrect static casts used in the upstream patch.

IMHO that would > be the best solution.  No, it is not. The patch should apply to 0.15 though. If you are more comfortable with bumping to an actual release than patching, you could ask upstream for a security release. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-15 18:13:46 UTC  ``` Oh, and Ismail - thanks for the corrected patch! ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  İsmail Dönmez    2007-12-15 18:38:55 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=202351#c7)) > Oh, and Ismail - thanks for the corrected patch!  Thats my pleasure.  ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Stefan Briesenick (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-15 19:10:35 UTC  ``` ok, currently we have 3 versions in portage. 0.13 which is stable and 0.14/0.15 which are testing. So I will remove 0.14 and patch 0.13.  But what to do with 0.15? Is there a patch already or can I use the 0.13 patch also? ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-16 00:14:40 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=202351#c9)) > ok, currently we have 3 versions in portage. 0.13 which is stable and 0.14/0.15 > which are testing. So I will remove 0.14 and patch 0.13. >  > But what to do with 0.15? Is there a patch already or can I use the 0.13 patch > also?  Since src/exif.cpp did not change at all between 0.13 and 0.15, whichever you patch is fine. There are several options, it's your choice as maintainer:  1) Patch 0.13, remove 0.14 and 0.15. 2) Patch 0.13, patch 0.15 with 0.13 staying stable. (remove 0.14 after that) 3) Patch 0.15 with 0.15 going stable. (remove 0.13 and 0.14 after that)  I'd go with (3) if you would stable 0.15 anyway soon, otherwise (2). (1) if you are lazy, but it will mean ~arch user's are going to downgrade their copies. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Stefan Briesenick (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-16 01:26:07 UTC  ``` ok, what I did:  1. removed 0.14 completely 2. revbumped 0.15 to 0.15-1 and removed 0.15 3. revbumped 0.13 to 0.13-1 and switched to testing  since the patch looks sane, it should be easy to stablize 0.13-r1 after a few tests. Furthermore, we should stabalize 0.15-r1 afterwards. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-16 13:26:50 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=202351#c8)) > (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=202351#c7)) > > Oh, and Ismail - thanks for the corrected patch! >  > Thats my pleasure.   Did you contact upstream about the issue in the patch or does this only affect the releases?  ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  İsmail Dönmez    2007-12-16 13:29:25 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=202351#c12)) > (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=202351#c8)) > > (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=202351#c7)) > > > Oh, and Ismail - thanks for the corrected patch! > >  > > Thats my pleasure.  >  > Did you contact upstream about the issue in the patch or does this only affect > the releases?  I didn't contact upstream as I guessed they would fix it once it fails to compile as the error is obvious.  ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-16 13:44:09 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=202351#c13)) > I didn't contact upstream as I guessed they would fix it once it fails to > compile as the error is obvious.  Hm, the trunk compiles fine for me. However, you are right, on the releases, the patch won't work.  ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-16 13:44:31 UTC  ``` Arches, please test and mark stable media-gfx/exiv2-0.13-r1.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Exiv2: Integer overflow — GLSA **200712-16**

An integer overflow vulnerability in Exiv2 possibly allows for the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/exiv2** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.13-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.13-r1** |

### Background

Exiv2 is a C++ library and set of tools for parsing, editing and saving
Exif and IPTC metadata from images. Exif, the Exchangeable image file
format, specifies the addition of metadata tags to JPEG, TIFF and RIFF
files.

### Description

Meder Kydyraliev (Google Security) discovered an integer overflow
vulnerability in the JpegThumbnail::setDataArea() method leading to a
heap-based buffer overflow.

### Impact

An attacker could entice the user of an application making use of Exiv2
or an application included in Exiv2 to load an image file with
specially crafted Exif tags, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Exiv2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/exiv2-0.13-r1"
```

## Details

Meder Kydyraliev discovered that exiv2 did not correctly handle certain

EXIF headers. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing

a specially crafted image, a remote attacker could cause the application

linked against libexiv2 to crash, leading to a denial of service, or

possibly executing arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2007-6353](/security/CVE-2007-6353))

Joakim Bildrulle discovered that exiv2 did not correctly handle Nikon

lens EXIF information. If a user or automated system were tricked into

processing a specially crafted image, a remote attacker could cause the

application linked against libexiv2 to crash, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2008-2696](/security/CVE-2008-2696))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
