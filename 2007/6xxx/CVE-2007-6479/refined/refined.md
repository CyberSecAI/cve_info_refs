  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when uploading files through the user profile, allowing an attacker to bypass file type restrictions.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary File Upload",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and server.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to register as a user, then access the user profile page to upload a file with a double extension (e.g., `shell.php.rar`). The server will save the file as the first extension, allowing execution.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to register as a user on the Dokeos platform. They need to navigate to their user profile page and utilize the file upload functionality to upload the malicious file. No special server access required."
