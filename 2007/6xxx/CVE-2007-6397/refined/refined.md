```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient input sanitization in user registration and profile editing, and cookie manipulation.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Remote User Credentials Disclosure: User information is revealed by visiting specific URLs.
    - Multiple Remote Command Executions/File Uploading: Unfiltered input during registration allows injecting malicious code into created PHP files.
    - Remote Directory Traversal/Source Disclosure: Directory traversal is possible through the `topic` and `viewprofile` parameters, allowing access to arbitrary files.
    - Remote Cookie Manipulation/Privilege Escalation: By modifying the `fpb_username` cookie, an attacker can impersonate another user.
- Impact of exploitation:
    - Exposure of user credentials
    - Execution of arbitrary code on the server
    - Access to arbitrary files on the server
    - Privilege escalation by impersonating other users
- Attack vectors:
    - Visiting specific URLs (`/users/[target_username].php`)
    - Registering a new account with malicious code in user fields
    - Manipulating the `topic` and `viewprofile` parameters in URLs
    - Directly editing the `fpb_username` cookie
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Network access to the vulnerable application
    - Ability to send HTTP requests
    - For some exploits, the ability to create a user account.
