Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-6390:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `mycalendar` plugin for Serendipity.
*   The plugin allows unescaped content inside links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, caused by the lack of proper sanitization of link content. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the blog page.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The plugin's form, which is used to inject the malicious code, does not have CSRF protection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the blog page by exploiting the lack of XSS protection in the plugin
*   By exploiting the CSRF vulnerability, an attacker can force a blog administrator to submit the vulnerable form, leading to the execution of the attacker's XSS payload. This can be used to perform a variety of attacks, like cookie stealing, session hijacking and other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code within a link.
*   The attacker then exploits the CSRF vulnerability in the `mycalendar` plugin's form, to cause a blog administrator to submit the form and inject the XSS payload.
*   When a user visits the affected blog page, the injected JavaScript code executes in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious payload.
*   The attacker needs the ability to trick an administrator of the Serendipity blog into submitting a form, potentially by embedding a crafted link on a website or in an email.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.13 of the `mycalendar` plugin.
*   The blog post mentions that the Serendipity developers were quick to respond and fix the issue, indicating responsible disclosure and patching.
*   The content provides more detail than the typical CVE description, including the exact plugin, the method of exploitation and the fix.
