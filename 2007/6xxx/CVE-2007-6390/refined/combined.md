How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#### [Private Keys in the Fortigate Leak](/archives/908-Private-Keys-in-the-Fortigate-Leak.html)

![Keys](/uploads/keyring.svg)A few days ago, a download link for a leak of configuration files for Fortigate/Fortinet devices was posted on an Internet forum. It appears that the data was collected in 2022 due to a security vulnerability known as CVE-2022-40684. According to a [blog post by Fortinet in 2022](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/psirt-blogs/update-regarding-cve-2022-40684), they were already aware of active exploitation of the issue back then. It was first [reported by heise](https://www.heise.de/en/news/Unknown-group-releases-Fortinet-config-files-and-VPN-passwords-to-the-darknet-10244238.html), a [post by Kevin Beaumont](https://doublepulsar.com/2022-zero-day-was-used-to-raid-fortigate-firewall-configs-somebody-just-released-them-a7a74e0b0c7f) contains further info.![](https://ssl-vg03.met.vgwort.de/na/38f23234f602490cb9bd474524bd01e5)

What has not been widely recognized is that this leak also contains TLS and SSH private keys. As I am developing [badkeys](https://badkeys.info/), a tool to identify insecure and compromised keys, this caught my attention. (The following analysis is based on an incomplete subset of the leak. I may update the post if I get access to more complete information.)

The leaked configurations contain keys looking like this (not an actual key from the leak):
```
    set private-key "-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
MIGjMF8GCSqGSIb3DQEFDTBSMDEGCSqGSIb3DQEFDDAkBBC5oRB/b9iViG5YoFmw
03T1AgIIADAMBggqhkiG9w0CCQUAMB0GCWCGSAFlAwQBKgQQPsMiXQoINAe2uBZX
cbB1MARAXz1LwSJhElDvazEtfywe9pLSdCG9+A0G6CMk2Lp5eR954OjScEQY6Zqe
9J3V/fCQeDanrAE+/dpCefjAD4LhGg==
-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----"
```
They also include corresponding certificates and keys in OpenSSH format. As you can see, these private keys are encrypted. However, above those keys, we can find the encryption password. The password is also encrypted, looking like this:
```
    set password ENC SGFja1RoZVBsYW5ldCF[...]UA==
```
A quick search for the encryption method turned up a [script containing code to decrypt these passwords](https://github.com/saladandonionrings/cve-2019-6693). The encryption key is static and publicly known.

The password line contains a Base64 string that decodes to 148 bytes. The first four bytes, padded with 12 zero bytes, are the initialization vector. The remaining bytes are the encrypted payload. The encryption uses AES-128 in CBC mode. The decrypted passwords appear to be mostly hex numbers and are padded with zero bytes - and sometimes other characters. (I am unaware of their meaning.)

In case I lost you here with technical details, the important takeaway is that in almost all cases, it is possible to decrypt the private key. (I may share a tool to extract the keys at a later point in time.)

The use of a static encryption key is a known vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2019-6693. According to [Fortinet's advisory from 2020](https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-19-007), this was "fixed" by introducing a setting that allows to configure a custom password.

"Fixing" default passwords by providing and documenting an option to change the password is something I have strong opinions about. It does not work ([see also](https://industrydecarbonization.com/news/insecure-password-allowed-administrative-access-to-electric-vehicle-chargers.html)).

One result of this incident is that it gives us some real-world data on how many people will actually change their password if the option is given to them and documented in a security advisory. 99,5% of the keys could be decrypted with the default password. (Consider this as a lower bound and not an exact number. The password decryption may be flaky due to the unclear padding mechanism.)

Overall, there were around 100,000 private keys in PKCS format and 60,000 in OpenSSH format. Most of the corresponding certificates were self-signed, but a few thousand were issued by publicly trusted web certificate authorities, most of them expired. However, the data included keys for 84 WebPKI certificates that were neither expired nor revoked as of this morning. Only 10 unexpired certificates were already revoked.

I have reported the still valid certificates to the responsible certificate authorities for revocation. CAs are obliged to revoke certificates with known-compromised keys within 24 hours. Therefore, these certificates will all be revoked soon. (I also filed [two](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1942241) [reports](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1942270) due to difficulties with the reporting process of some CAs.)

As mentioned above, it was already known in 2022 that this vulnerabiltiy was actively exploited. Yet, it appears that, overwhelmingly, this did not lead to people replacing their likely compromised private keys and revoking their certificates. While we cannot tell from this observation whether the same is true for passwords and other private keys not used in publicly trusted certificates, it appears likely.

**Rant**

It is an unfortunate reality that these days, security products often are themselves the source of security vulnerabilities. While I have no empirical evidence for this (and nobody else has the data, [have I complained about this before?](https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-8169-in_search_of_evidence-based_it-security)), I believe that we have entered a situation in recent years where security products turned from "mostly useless, sometimes harmful" to "almost certainly causing more security issues than they prevent". I have more thoughts on this that I may share at another time.

If you are wondering what to do, the solution is neither to patch and fix your Fortinet device nor to buy additional attack surface from one of its equally bad competitors. It is to stop believing that adding more attack surface will increase security.

**Detecting affected keys**

Detection for those keys has been added to [badkeys](https://badkeys.info/). It is an open source tool, installable via [Python's package management](https://pypi.org/project/badkeys/). You can use it to scan SSH host keys, certificates, or private keys. Make sure to update the badkeys blocklist (*badkeys --update-bl*) before doing so.

Please note that this detection is currently based on incomplete data and does not cover all keys in the leak. More updates with more complete coverage may come. Please also note that I have not made the private keys public. Unlike in other cases, this means badkeys cannot give you the private key. (I may decide to publish the keys at some point in the future.)

The badkeys blocklist uses a yet poorly documented format (it is on my todo list to improve this). I am [sharing a list of SPKI SHA256 hashes of the affected keys](https://github.com/hannob/forti/raw/refs/heads/main/spkisha256-forti-compromised-keys.txt) to make it easier for others to write their own detection.

**Update (2025-01-23):** As mentioned, the original analysis was done with an incomplete set of the data. I later was able to access more complete data, increasing the number of keys to around 98,000 SSH keys and 167,000 PKCS keys. This also led to additional certificates reported for revocation. I have not kept track of the exact numbers. Therefore, the numbers above all refer to the incomplete dataset.

You can find a [script to extract and decrypt passwords and private keys from Fortigate configuration files here](https://github.com/hannob/forti/blob/main/fortipwkey).

**Update (2025-01-24):** During further analysis, I discovered that the dataset contained 314 private keys belonging to Let's Encrypt ACME accounts. I have now deactivated those accounts. Given that it has been over a week since the initial report of the incident, this adds to the impression that neither Fortinet itself nor their affected customers appear to have put any effort into cleaning up after this incident.

#### [How to create a Secure, Random Password with JavaScript](/archives/907-How-to-create-a-Secure%2C-Random-Password-with-JavaScript.html)

![Dice](/uploads/dice.svg)I recently needed to create a random password in a piece of JavaScript code. It was surprisingly difficult to find instructions and good examples of how to do that. Almost every result that Google, StackOverflow, or, for that matter, ChatGPT, turned up was flawed in one way or another.

Let's look at a few examples and learn how to create an actually secure password generation function. Our goal is to create a password from a defined set of characters with a fixed length. The password should be generated from a secure source of randomness, and it should have a uniform distribution, meaning every character should appear with the same likelihood. While the examples are JavaScript code, the principles can be used in any programming language.

One of the first examples to show up in Google is a [blog post on the webpage dev.to](https://dev.to/code_mystery/random-password-generator-using-javascript-6a). Here is the relevant part of the code:
```
/* Example with weak random number generator, DO NOT USE */
 var chars = "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz!@#$%^&*()ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
 var passwordLength = 12;
 var password = "";
 for (var i = 0; i <= passwordLength; i++) {
   var randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * chars.length);
   password += chars.substring(randomNumber, randomNumber +1);
  }
```
In this example, the source of randomness is the function *Math.random()*. It generates a random number between 0 and 1. The [documentation of *Math.random()* in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) says:

***Math.random()** does not provide cryptographically secure random numbers. Do not use them for anything related to security. Use the Web Crypto API instead, and more precisely, the **window.crypto.getRandomValues()** method.*

This is pretty clear: We should not use *Math.random()* for security purposes, as it gives us no guarantees about the security of its output. This is not a merely theoretical concern: [here is an example where someone used Math.random() to generate tokens](https://medium.com/%40betable/tifu-by-using-math-random-f1c308c4fd9d) and ended up seeing duplicate tokens in real-world use.

MDN tells us to use the **getRandomValues()** function of the Web Crypto API, which generates cryptographically strong random numbers.

We can make a more general statement here: Whenever we need randomness for security purposes, we should use a cryptographically secure random number generator. Even in non-security contexts, using secure random sources usually has no downsides. Theoretically, cryptographically strong random number generators can be slower, but unless you generate Gigabytes of random numbers, this is irrelevant. (I am not going to expand on how exactly cryptographically strong random number generators work, as this is something that should be done by the operating system. You can find [a good introduction here](https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7441-the_plain_simple_reality_of_entropy).)

All modern operating systems have built-in functionality for this. Unfortunately, for historical reasons, in many programming languages, there are simple and more widely used random number generation functions that many people use, and APIs for secure random numbers often come with extra obstacles and may not always be available. However, in the case of Javascript, [**crypto.getRandomValues()** has been available in all major browsers for over a decade](https://caniuse.com/getrandomvalues).

After establishing that we should not use **Math.random()**, we may check whether searching specifically for that gives us a better answer. When we search for "Javascript random password without Math.Random()", the first result that shows up is titled ["Never use Math.random() to create passwords in JavaScript"](https://whereisthebug.com/never-use-math-random-for-passwords/). That sounds like a good start. Unfortunately, it makes another mistake. Here is the code it recommends:
```
/* Example with floating point rounding bias, DO NOT USE */
function generatePassword(length = 16)
{
    let generatedPassword = "";

    const validChars = "0123456789" +
        "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" +
        "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" +
        ",.-{}+!\"#$%/()=?";

    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        let randomNumber = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint32Array(1))[0];
        randomNumber = randomNumber / 0x100000000;
        randomNumber = Math.floor(randomNumber * validChars.length);

        generatedPassword += validChars[randomNumber];
    }

    return generatedPassword;
}
```
This generates a random 32-bit unsigned integer with **crypto.getRandomValues()**, which is good. It divides that by the hexadecimal value 0x100000000, which is the upper bound of the possible values in a 32-bit unsigned integer. In other words, it is converting to a float between 0 and 1, likely trying to emulate what **Math.random()** provides.

The problem with this approach is that it uses floating-point numbers. It is generally a good idea to avoid floats in security and particularly cryptographic applications whenever possible. Floats introduce rounding errors, and due to the way they are stored, it is practically almost impossible to generate a uniform distribution. (See also [this explanation in a StackExchange comment](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/31659).)

Therefore, while this implementation is better than the first and probably "good enough" for random passwords, it is not ideal. It does not give us the best security we can have with a certain length and character choice of a password.

Another way of mapping a random integer number to an index for our list of characters is to use a random value modulo the size of our character class. Here is [an example from a StackOverflow comment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51540480):
```
/* Example with modulo bias, DO NOT USE */
var generatePassword = (
  length = 20,
  characters = '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz~!@-#$'
) =>
  Array.from(crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint32Array(length)))
    .map((x) => characters[x % characters.length])
    .join('')
```
This is also not ideal. It introduces a modulo bias.

The modulo bias in this example is quite small, so let's look at a different example. Assume we use letters and numbers (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, 62 characters total) and take a single byte (256 different values, 0-255) *r* from the random number generator. If we use the modulus *r % 62*, some characters are more likely to appear than others. The reason is that 256 is not a multiple of 62, so it is impossible to map our byte to this list of characters with a uniform distribution.

In our example, the lowercase "a" would be mapped to five values (0, 62, 124, 186, 248). The uppercase "A" would be mapped to only four values (26, 88, 150, 212). Some values have a higher probability than others.

(For more detailed explanations of a modulo bias, check [this post by Yolan Romailler from Kudelski Security](https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2020/07/28/the-definitive-guide-to-modulo-bias-and-how-to-avoid-it/) and [this post from Sebastian Pipping](https://blog.hartwork.org/posts/arc4random_uniform-and-avoiding-modulo-bias-when-using-a-random-number-generator/).)

One way to avoid a modulo bias is to use rejection sampling. The idea is that you throw away the values that cause higher probabilities. In our example above, 248 and higher values cause the modulo bias, so if we generate such a value, we repeat the process. A piece of code to generate a single random character could look like this:
```
const pwchars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789";
const limit = 256 - (256 % pwchars.length);
do {
  randval = window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(1))[0];
} while (randval >= limit);
```
Values equal or above *limit* get thrown away. The limit is set to the number of possible values in a byte modulo the number of different characters we want to use. We generate a random byte, and if it is above the limit, we will just repeat that process until we get a suitable value.

An alternative to rejection sampling is to make the modulo bias so small that it does not matter (by using a very large random value).

However, I find rejection sampling to be a much cleaner solution. If you argue that the modulo bias is so small that it does not matter, you must carefully analyze whether this is true. For a password, a small modulo bias may be okay. For cryptographic applications, things can be different. Rejection sampling avoids the modulo bias completely. Therefore, it is always a safe choice.

There are two things you might wonder about this approach. One is that it introduces a timing difference. In cases where the random number generator turns up multiple numbers in a row that are thrown away, the code runs a bit longer.

Timing differences can be a problem in security code, but this one is not. It does not reveal any information about the password because it is only influenced by values we throw away. Even if an attacker were able to measure the exact timing of our password generation, it would not give him any useful information. (This argument is however only true for a cryptographically secure random number generator. It assumes that the ignored random values do not reveal any information about the random number generator's internal state.)

Another issue with this approach is that it is not guaranteed to finish in any given time. Theoretically, the random number generator could produce numbers above our limit so often that the function stalls. However, the probability of that happening quickly becomes so low that it is irrelevant. Such code is generally so fast that even multiple rounds of rejection would not cause a noticeable delay.

To summarize: If we want to write a secure, random password generation function, we should consider three things: We should use a secure random number generation function. We should avoid floating point numbers. And we should avoid a modulo bias.

Taking this all together, here is a Javascript function that generates a 15-character password, composed of ASCII letters and numbers:
```
function simplesecpw() {
  const pwlen = 15;
  const pwchars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789";
  const limit = 256 - (256 % pwchars.length);

  let passwd = "";
  let randval;
  for (let i = 0; i < pwlen; i++) {
    do {
      randval = window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(1))[0];
    } while (randval >= limit);
    passwd += pwchars[randval % pwchars.length];
  }
  return passwd;
}
```
We first define our length and string of possible characters. We calculate the limit for the modulo bias. We run a for loop 15 times. Inside that loop, we have a while loop generating a random byte and implementing rejection sampling. Finally, we use the generated random value modulo the number of possible characters as our index. Overall, this is just 15 lines of code, and it is not particularly complicated.

If you want to use that code, feel free to do so. I have [published it](https://github.com/hannob/secpw/blob/main/simplesecpw.js) - and a [slightly more configurable version](https://github.com/hannob/secpw/blob/main/secpw.js) that allows optionally setting the length and the set of characters - under a very permissive license (0BSD license).

![Efail](/uploads/efail-blue.svg)I recently wrote down my thoughts about why I think deprecated cryptographic standards are to blame for the Efail vulnerability in OpenPGP and S/MIME. However I promised that I'll also cover the other huge part that made a bug like Efail possible: HTML mails.![](https://ssl-vg03.met.vgwort.de/na/3b6a271f047c4b97b7ace834d082ab08)

#### [efail: Outdated Crypto Standards are to blame](/archives/893-efail-Outdated-Crypto-Standards-are-to-blame.html)

![efail logo](/uploads/efail-red.svg)I have a lot of thoughts about the recently published [efail](https://efail.de/) vulnerability, so I thought I'd start to writeup some of them. I'd like to skip all the public outrage about the disclosure process for now, as I mainly wanted to get into the technical issues, explain what I think went wrong and how things can become more secure in the future. I read lots of wrong statements that "it's only the mail clients" and the underlying crypto standards are fine, so I'll start by explaining why I believe the OpenPGP and S/MIME standards are broken and why we still see these kinds of bugs in 2018. I plan to do a second writeup that will be titled "efail: HTML mails are to blame".![](https://ssl-vg03.met.vgwort.de/na/f4b98b03f3d14c3aa512a963558dfd06)

#### [Introducing Snallygaster - a Tool to Scan for Secrets on Web Servers](/archives/892-Introducing-Snallygaster-a-Tool-to-Scan-for-Secrets-on-Web-Servers.html)

![Snallygaster](/uploads/snallygaster.jpg)A few days ago I figured out that [several blogs operated by T-Mobile Austria had a Git repository exposed which included their wordpress configuration file](https://twitter.com/hanno/status/982530027135922179). Due to the fact that a phpMyAdmin installation was also accessible this would have allowed me to change or delete their database and subsequently take over their blogs.![](https://ssl-vg03.met.vgwort.de/na/78a134f5d0cf4ae4a36b06dba4c8eb23)

#### [Some minor Security Quirks in Firefox](/archives/891-Some-minor-Security-Quirks-in-Firefox.html)

![Firefox](/uploads/firefox-logo.svg)I discovered a couple of more or less minor security issues in Firefox lately. None of them is particularly scary, but they affect interesting corner cases or unusual behavior. I'm posting this mainly hoping that other people will find it inspiring to think about unusual security issues and maybe also come up with more realistic attack scenarios for these bugs.![](https://ssl-vg03.met.vgwort.de/na/c1c4ff014dbe488ba0d564ceaf1a85a2)

#### [In Search of a Secure Time Source](/archives/890-In-Search-of-a-Secure-Time-Source.html)

***Update:** This blogpost was written before NTS was available, and the information is outdated. If you are looking for a modern solution, I recommend using software and a time server with Network Time Security, as specified in [RFC 8915](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8915).*

# Some XSS issues in Serendipity found

#### [Some XSS issues in Serendipity found](/archives/572-Some-XSS-issues-in-Serendipity-found.html)

I recently stepped upon some XSS issues in Serendipity.

The first is in the remoterss-plugin, which can be used to display the content of an RSS feed in the sidebar of a blog. It didn't escape links, so JavaScript-Code could be injected by malicious RSS feeds. This plugin is shipped with the base version of S9Y. They've released 1.2.1 this weekend which has the fix.

If you're using the remoterss plugin, you should upgrade to 1.2.1 as soon as possible. This issue is named [CVE-2007-6205](http://www.int21.de/cve/CVE-2007-6205-s9y.html).

The other one is in the external mycalendar-plugin. It also allows unescaped content inside links. This wouldn't be a real issue, as this form should only be accessible by the blog administrator. But the form had no CSRF (Cross-Site-Request-Forgery) protection, so an attacker could trigger this form and thus inject javascript on the blog-page. This has been fixed within version 0.13 of the plugin, so if you're using it, please upgrade. CVE-2007-6390 now assigned.

Beside I'd like to note that I got fast replies to my reports and the s9y devs fixed them quite quickly. Thanks for that!

Schöne Sache @ RemoteRSS.

Allerdings solltest du noch deine freewvs-Datenbank bzgl. dessen updaten, da es momentan noch nicht über die alte Version meckert.

Can freewvs detect if somebody uses the remoterss-plugin ? Or will you start to bug me because I did not update even though I do not use this plugin ? ;-)

It'll bug you.

But in this case, I would prefer that behaviour.

It will bug you and I don't see much I can change to that. That's a conceptual problem of freewvs.

freewvs always checks for any vulnerability, although in many cases it'll cry about vulnerabilities that don't really affect the installation. This is not only for plugins, but also for stuff like »only affects if register\_globals is set", "only a risk in combination with outdated php version" or many other cases. Especially in this case, the only way to see if this plugin is used would be to look into the database - and that's most probably not a good idea.

Anyway, s9y update process is pretty straight and usually doesn't cause much pain.
