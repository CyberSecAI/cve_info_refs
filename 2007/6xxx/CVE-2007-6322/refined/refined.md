Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-6322:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the `filedownload.php` script of the `xml2owl` application. Specifically, the `file` parameter is not sanitized, allowing attackers to manipulate it to access arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness is the ability to perform directory traversal via the `file` parameter. By using sequences like `../`, an attacker can navigate up the directory structure and access files outside of the intended web directory.
*   **Remote File Disclosure:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to read the content of arbitrary files on the server, which is a form of information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidential Data Exposure:** The most significant impact is the potential exposure of sensitive information. Attackers can read configuration files (like `config.inc.php`, which may contain database credentials or other sensitive settings), system files (like `/etc/passwd`), or application source code.
*   **System Compromise:** If access control mechanisms are weak, attackers might be able to obtain credentials and further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `filedownload.php`. The `file` parameter is manipulated to include directory traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server hosting the `xml2owl` application.
*   **Basic Web Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs only a basic understanding of HTTP requests and how to manipulate URL parameters.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability in `xml2owl`'s `filedownload.php` allows attackers to read arbitrary files on the server by exploiting a lack of proper sanitization on the `file` parameter, leading to directory traversal and remote file disclosure. This can expose sensitive configuration files, system files, or application source code.
