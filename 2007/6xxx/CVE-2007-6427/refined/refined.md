The bugs range from crashing the X server to executing arbitrary code with the privilges of the X server process. For a successful attack the opponent needs shell access to the vulnerable system (local) or an already established connection to the X server. The Fixes are: - CVE-2007-5760: XFree86 Misc extension out of bounds array index - CVE-2007-5958: File existence disclosure - CVE-2007-6427: Xinput extension memory corruption - CVE-2007-6428: TOG-cup extension memory corruption - CVE-2007-6429: MIT-SHM and EVI extensions integer overflows - CVE-2008-0006: PCF Font parser buffer overflow",
