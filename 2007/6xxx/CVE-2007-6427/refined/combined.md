1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The X windows system is vulnerable to several kind of vulner-
abilities that are caused due to insufficient input validation.
The bugs range from crashing the X server to executing arbitrary
code with the privilges of the X server process.
For a successful attack the opponent needs shell access to the
vulnerable system (local) or an already established connection
to the X server.
Thanks to US CERT and iDefense for reporting this vulnerabilities
and to the Xorg-Security folks for fixing it.
The Fixes are:
- CVE-2007-5760: XFree86 Misc extension out of bounds array index
- CVE-2007-5958: File existence disclosure
- CVE-2007-6427: Xinput extension memory corruption
- CVE-2007-6428: TOG-cup extension memory corruption
- CVE-2007-6429: MIT-SHM and EVI extensions integer overflows
- CVE-2008-0006: PCF Font parser buffer overflow
2) Solution or Work-Around
none
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart your X server. (logout and login)
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# NX: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200804-05**

NX uses code from the X.org X11 server which is prone to multiple
vulnerabilities.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/nxnode** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.1.0-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.1.0-r2** |

| Package | **net-misc/nx** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.1.0-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.1.0-r1** |

### Background

NoMachine's NX establishes remote connections to X11 desktops over
small bandwidth links. NX and NX Node are the compression core
libraries, whereas NX is used by FreeNX and NX Node by the binary-only
NX servers.

### Description

Multiple integer overflow and buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been
discovered in the X.Org X server as shipped by NX and NX Node
(vulnerabilities 1-4 in GLSA 200801-09).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities via unspecified
vectors, leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges
of the user on the machine running the NX server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All NX Node users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/nxnode-3.1.0-r2"
```

All NX users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/nx-3.1.0-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.1.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

---

* **001: SECURITY FIX: April 27, 2007**
    *All architectures*

  Incorrect mbuf handling for ICMP6 packets.

  Using
  [pf(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.1/pf.4)
  to avoid the problem packets is an effective workaround until the patch
  can be installed.

  Use "block in inet6" in /etc/pf.conf

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.1/common/001_mbuf.patch)

  * **002: STABILITY FIX: April 27, 2007**
      *All architectures*

    Incorrect spl level can lead to panics under heavy kqueue usage.

                              execute arbitrary commands. This behaviour was documented, but was an unsafe
                              default and an extra hassle for administrators.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- wireshark security problems
Multiple flaws in wireshark could lead to crashes when certain
packets are processed (CVE-2008-1561,CVE-2008-1562,CVE-2008-1563)
These problems only affected wireshark in openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3
and were fixed there.
- otrs SOAP command execution
A bug in the trouble ticket system OTRS allowed a remote attacker
to get remote access without specifying a valid user name via the
SOAP interface (CVE-2008-1515).
otrs is only included on openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 and was fixed there.
- xine security problems
Specially crafted files could cause integer overflows in the xine
library.
Attackers could potentially exploit that to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user who opened such a file
(CVE-2008-1482).
xine was updated on all SUSE Linux products containing xine.
- xgl various X related security fixes
Xgl uses the XFree86/X.Org code base and so was also affected by
various integer overflow bugs found and fixed in those.
(CVE-2007-6429, CVE-2007-1003, CVE-2007-5958, CVE-2007-6427,
CVE-2007-6428, CVE-2007-6429, CVE-2008-0006)
Xgl was updated on SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10, SUSE Linux 10.1,
openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- silc-toolkit buffer overflow
A flaw in processing PKCS#1-Messages in silc-toolkit could lead
to a buffer overflow. Remote attackers could exploit that to crash
the server. (CVE-2008-1552)
Only openSUSE 10.3 contains silc-toolkit and was fixed.
- lighttpd security problems
Several security problems were fixed in lighttpd.
- Remote attackers were able to crash lighttpd by opening
a large number of connections (CVE-2008-0983).
- A bug in mod\_cgi allowed remote attackers to read
cgi source files (CVE-2008-1111).
- A bug in mod\_userdir allowed remote attackers to read
arbitrary files (CVE-2008-1270).
lighttpd is only included in SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 (SDK),
SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 and was fixed for those
distributions.
- tk GIF problems
Specially crafted GIF images could cause a buffer overflow and
crash the toolkit library tk. It seems unlikely but not entirely
impossible that this overflow can be exploited to execute arbitrary
code (CVE-2008-0553).
Tk was updated on all products.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

And people still can build and verify all drivers by building them
outside if necessary. Heck, what do we have build.sh for? And Egbert
announced that he had written a new build system that even tracks
dependencies correctly, with little to virtually no interest on the
mailing list at all.

And it really works very well.

No. Half of the driver ten to be broken at any given point of time,
because developers change internal APIs without validating that all
users of these APIs are updated accordingly as well.

Sometimes APIs are even broken in such a subtle way, that there is no
way e.g. in the driver code to actually work around these breakages with
additional autohell logic (e.g. the most infamous XVideo API update for
Composite). It would have been too easy if there was a #define for
testing this.

Here I agree *very* much with you.
But how do you do that? I think a tinderbox-like build system would
improve the situation a lot here, though a lot of statements about the
quality of tinderbox itself have been stated on this list.

Having a monolithic build system doesn't necessarily change this. Those
developers who don't believe in thorough API build tests won't
necessarily build all drivers in the monolithic tree as well.

Sigh. On the fetch-and-build side we really have work to do. Maybe we
should check Egbert's solution again, I thought to remember that it even
checked out the necessary trees if told to.
This certainly has to be documented better. I'm not pointing to anyone
here, just considering the state.

I do driver development on a daily basis, and I don't even work against
current git head. The SDK from the last release is working well enough
in most cases. This might not be the case for the intel driver, though.

Err - I think you meant non-monolithic here, right? In your
argumentation line, I mean :)

We don't have that people here at X. Heck, even posted patches are not
validated or checked in. So the kernel development model won't fit
without the necessary people willing to do that.

Which doesn't solve a thing.
Sorry for being destructive (and not constructive), but I just don't see
what this would help. I also don't see a technical solution at all to
this IMHO social problem. A tinderbox like solution might help, though.

> The current situation completely sucks.

Ok, something to agree on.

* **001: SECURITY FIX: October 8, 2007**
    *All architectures*

  Malicious DHCP clients could cause dhcpd(8) to corrupt its stack

  A DHCP client that claimed to require a maximum message size less than
  the minimum IP MTU could cause dhcpd(8) to overwrite stack memory.

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: October 10, 2007**
      *All architectures*

    The SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers() function in OpenSSL contains an off-by-one overflow.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.2/common/002_openssl.patch)

    * **003: CD BOOT FAILURE ON OLDER COMPUTERS : October 30, 2007**
        *i386 only*

      Some older BIOSes are unable to boot CD1 (ie. the commercial release sold
      by the project, not the CD images available on the net).
      A workaround using CD2 (amd64 architecture) is as follows.
      (An amd64 machine is *NOT* required for this to work.)

      1. Insert CD2 and tell your computer to boot it;
         * When the `boot>` prompt appears, stop the automatic boot
           by pressing the space bar;
           * Remove CD2 and insert CD1;
             * Erase the character you typed to stop the boot, type

               `boot /4.2/i386/bsd.rd`

               then press *Enter*.

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: November 27, 2007**
          *All architectures*

        A memory leak in pf can lead to machine lockups.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- SUN Java 1.5 and 1.6 update
SUN Java 1.5.0 was brought to update14 and SUN Java 1.6.0 was
brought to update4. Details for the security issues fixed are not
yet publicly known, but the changelog lists several issues marked
as security.
The update also contains timezone update 2007k and was released
for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- nss\_ldap incorrect data
nss\_ldap returned incorrect data under certain circumstances to
the calling process. Some applications could therefore work with
wrong user data (CVE-2007-5794).
This has been fixed for all distributions containing nss\_ldap.
- cairo integer overflows in PNG decoder
The cairo libraries were updated to fix several integer overflows
while decoding PNG images. This can be exploited remotely with
user-assistance to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2007-5503)
Updates have been provided for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE Linux
10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3
- geronimo start script problems
A chown in the SUSE supplied Apache geronimo init script could
change ownership of directories it did not own, due to following
symlinks. The default setup would corrupt /var/tmp on start
of geronimo.
While there is potential to exploit this problem,
the administrator will have likely noticed this before already.
- moodle XSS problems
The install script of moodle is vulnerable to cross site scripting
(XSS). This flaw is only exploitable if moodle isn't fully installed
yet. Therefore it's unlikely to be much of a problem in practice. To
actually exploit it an attacker would have to know about a person
that is just about to install moodle (CVE-2008-0123).
- SDL\_image GIF problems
Specially crafted GIF files could crash the SDL\_image library
(CVE-2006-4484).
Updates have been released for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2
and 10.3.
- python imageop integer overflow
Specially crafted images could trigger an integer overflow in the
imageop module of python (CVE-2007-4965).
Python has been updated on all SUSE Linux based distributions.
- Mysql security problems
The database server MySQL was updated to fix various security
vulnerabilities. Note: not all versions are affected by every bug:
- CVE-2007-2583: a denial of service attack in in\_decimal::set for
logged in users.
- CVE-2007-2691: RENAME TABLE did not require DROP privileges,
allowing remote authenticated users to rename arbitrary tables
- CVE-2007-2692: remote authenticated users could gain privileges
due to a bug in SQL SECURITY INVOKER stored routine handling
- CVE-2007-5925: a denial of service attack by remote authenticated
users via a certain CONTAINS operation on an indexed column
- CVE-2007-5969: allowed remote authenticated users to overwrite
system table information and gain privileges via symlinks
- CVE-2007-6303: allowed remote authenticated users to gain
privileges via CREATE SQL SECURITY DEFINER VIEW and ALTER VIEW
statements
- CVE-2007-6304: denial of service attack by remote authenticated
users by performing a specific SHOW TABLE STATUS query
MySQL has been updated on all SUSE Linux based distributions.
- NX also affected by X.org security problems
This update fixes various Xserver security issues that are also
present in NX:
XInput Extension Memory Corruption Vulnerability [IDEF2888 CVE-2007-6427].
TOG-CUP Extension Memory Corruption Vulnerability [IDEF2901 CVE-2007-6428].
EVI Extension Integer Overflow Vulnerability [IDEF2902 CVE-2007-6429].
MIT-SHM Extension Integer Overflow Vulnerability [IDEF2904 CVE-2007-6429].
- xemacs commandline buffer overflow
A buffer overflow in xemacs commandline handling was
fixed. (CVE-2007-6109)
This problem affected only openSUSE 10.3.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
None listed this week.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Linux Terminal Server Project: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200805-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in components shipped with
LTSP which allow remote attackers to compromise terminal clients.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/ltsp** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.0** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

The Linux Terminal Server Project adds thin-client support to Linux
servers.

### Description

LTSP version 4.2, ships prebuilt copies of programs such as the Linux
Kernel, the X.org X11 server (GLSA 200705-06, GLSA 200710-16, GLSA
200801-09), libpng (GLSA 200705-24, GLSA 200711-08), Freetype (GLSA
200705-02, GLSA 200705-22) and OpenSSL (GLSA 200710-06, GLSA 200710-30)
which were subject to multiple security vulnerabilities since 2006.
Please note that the given list of vulnerabilities might not be
exhaustive.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly exploit vulnerabilities in the
aforementioned programs and execute arbitrary code, disclose sensitive
data or cause a Denial of Service within LTSP 4.2 clients.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

LTSP 4.2 is not maintained upstream in favor of version 5. Since
version 5 is not yet available in Gentoo, the package has been masked.
We recommend that users unmerge LTSP:

```
 # emerge --unmerge net-misc/ltsp
```

If you have a requirement for Linux Terminal Servers, please either set
up a terminal server by hand or use one of the distributions that
already migrated to LTSP 5. If you want to contribute to the
integration of LTSP 5 in Gentoo, or want to follow its development,
find details in bug 177580.

# X.Org X server and Xfont library: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200801-09**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the X.Org X server and
Xfont library, allowing for a local privilege escalation and arbitrary code
execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-base/xorg-server** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.0.0-r5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.0.0-r5** |

| Package | **x11-libs/libXfont** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.1-r1** |

### Background

The X Window System is a graphical windowing system based on a
client/server model.

### Description

regenrecht reported multiple vulnerabilities in various X server
extension via iDefense:

* The XFree86-Misc extension does not properly sanitize a parameter
  within a PassMessage request, allowing the modification of a function
  pointer (CVE-2007-5760).
* Multiple functions in the XInput extension do not properly sanitize
  client requests for swapping bytes, leading to corruption of heap
  memory (CVE-2007-6427).
* Integer overflow vulnerabilities in the EVI extension and in the
  MIT-SHM extension can lead to buffer overflows (CVE-2007-6429).
* The TOG-CUP extension does not sanitize an index value in the
  ProcGetReservedColormapEntries() function, leading to arbitrary memory
  access (CVE-2007-6428).
* A buffer overflow was discovered in the Xfont library when
  processing PCF font files (CVE-2008-0006).
* The X server does not enforce restrictions when a user specifies a
  security policy file and attempts to open it (CVE-2007-5958).

### Impact

Remote attackers could exploit the vulnerability in the Xfont library
by enticing a user to load a specially crafted PCF font file resulting
in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the X server, typically root. Local attackers could exploit
this and the vulnerabilities in the X.org extensions to gain elevated
privileges. If the X server allows connections from the network, these
vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely. A local attacker could
determine the existence of arbitrary files by exploiting the last
vulnerability or possibly cause a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

Workarounds for some of the vulnerabilities can be found in the X.Org
security advisory as listed under References.

### Resolution

All X.Org X server users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-base/xorg-server-1.3.0.0-r5"
```

All X.Org Xfont library users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/libXfont-1.3.1-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
