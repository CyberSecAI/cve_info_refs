  "CVE-2007-6589": {
    "Description": "The `jar:` URI scheme in Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by including malicious web pages within zip archives. This is due to the browser not properly checking the MIME type of the archive before interpreting it, allowing a zip file served with an image MIME type to be interpreted as a web page. Additionally, redirects caused further confusion about the origin of `jar:` content allowing attacks against sites with open redirects, even if they don't allow uploads.",
    "Root cause": "The `jar:` URI scheme in Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey failed to properly validate the MIME type of the archive, leading to incorrect interpretation of content. The browser also did not properly update the security context when a HTTP redirect happened.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "MIME type validation bypass",
      "Incorrect security context update on redirects"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could perform XSS attacks against a web site that allows binary uploads or by exploiting open redirects. This could lead to arbitrary script execution within the user's browser with the same privileges as the victim website, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, and sensitive data like contact lists.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Uploading a malicious zip file to a vulnerable website",
      "Exploiting open redirects to deliver a malicious zip file"
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker would need the ability to upload a zip file to a website or identify a site with an open redirect and be able to craft a malicious zip file containing an XSS payload.",
      "Additional Details": "The vulnerability was discovered by Jesse Ruderman, Petko D. Petkov, and beford.org. The fix involves restricting support for the `jar:` URI scheme to files served with `application/java-archive` or `application/x-jar` content types and blocking scripting, plugins, and redirects when unsafe MIME types are used. A pref was introduced to allow users to enable unsafe types in the `jar:` URI scheme, but it defaults to false. The fix also addresses the issue of redirects by updating the `jar:` URI with the post-redirect URI, preventing security context issues. It also blocks inherited loads from unsafe docshells, preventing other documents from inheriting the security context of the unsafe channel. Specific error messages are also implemented when a resource is blocked due to the incorrect MIME type."
