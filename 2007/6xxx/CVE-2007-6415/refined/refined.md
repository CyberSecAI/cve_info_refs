  "CVE-2007-6415": {
    "Description": "scponly 4.6 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended restrictions and execute arbitrary code by invoking scp, as implemented by OpenSSH, with the -F and -o options.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The scponly application does not properly filter the '-F' and '-o' options when invoking the 'scp' command, which can lead to arbitrary command execution.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Insufficient filtering of dangerous options to scp"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended restrictions and execute arbitrary commands on the vulnerable host.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by invoking scp with the -F and -o options through a vulnerable scponly instance.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be a remote user who has been authenticated to the vulnerable scponly system."
