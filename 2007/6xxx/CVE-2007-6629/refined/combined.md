How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

A buffer-overflow vulnerability is exploitable through a stack buffer
of 15 bytes called trash used as destination by sscanf without the
needed size limits.

A buffer-overflow vulnerability is exploitable through a stack buffer

unsigned short status;
char msg[100];

---------------------------
C] crash in RTSP\_remove\_msg
---------------------------
An integer overflow is exploitable through the RTP packets.
Using a 16 bit size value of 0xffff is possible to force the server to
move 4294967293 bytes in the destination buffer:
RTSP\_BUFFERSIZE = 65536
len = 65539 (4 of hdrlen + 0xffff)
result = -3
From rtsp/RTSP\_lowlevel.c:
void RTSP\_remove\_msg(int len, RTSP\_buffer \* rtsp)
{
rtsp->in\_size -= len;
if (rtsp->in\_size && len) { /\* discard the message from the in\_buffer. \*/
memmove(rtsp->in\_buffer, &(rtsp->in\_buffer[len]),
RTSP\_BUFFERSIZE - len);
memset(&(rtsp->in\_buffer[len]), 0, RTSP\_BUFFERSIZE - len);
}
}
-----------------------------------------
D] NULL pointer in parse\_transport\_header
-----------------------------------------
From rtsp/RTSP\_setup.c:
static RTSP\_Error parse\_transport\_header(RTSP\_buffer \* rtsp,
...
p = strstr(p, "=");
sscanf(p + 1, "%d", &(cli\_ports.RTP));
p = strstr(p, "-");
sscanf(p + 1, "%d", &(cli\_ports.RTCP));
...
p = strstr(p, "=");
sscanf(p + 1, "%d", &rtp\_ch);
...
p = strstr(p, "=");
sscanf(p + 1, "%d", &rtp\_ch);
...
----------------------------------------
E] NULL pointer in parse\_play\_time\_range
----------------------------------------
From rtsp/RTSP\_Play:
static RTSP\_Error parse\_play\_time\_range(RTSP\_buffer \* rtsp, play\_args \* args)
...
q = strchr(q, '=');
if (get\_utc(&(args->playback\_time), q + 1) != ERR\_NOERROR) {
...
---------------------------------
F] NULL pointer in log\_user\_agent
---------------------------------
The log\_user\_agent function uses an unchecked strstr for finding the
end of the User-Agent value (a line field), but the server can handle
also carriage-return chars allowing an attacker to crash it using only
0x0d chars in his request.
From rtsp/RTSP\_utils.c:
void log\_user\_agent(RTSP\_buffer \* rtsp)
{
char \* p;
if ((p = strstr(rtsp->in\_buffer, HDR\_USER\_AGENT)) != NULL) {
char cut[strlen(p)];
strcpy(cut, p);
p = strstr(cut, "\n");
cut[strlen(cut) - strlen(p) - 1] = '\0';
...
----------------------------------
G] NULL pointer in Netembryo 0.0.4
----------------------------------
Although this vulnerability affects another software of the LScube
project I have preferred to include it here since only when used with
Feng this bug can be considered a security bug (Netembryo in fact is
used also in libnemesi which is a client-side library).
The usage of the ':' char after the backslash allows an attacker to
crash the server on which is used the Url\_init() function of the
Netembryo library.
In short when an urlname like /: is used the port\_begin and path\_begin
pointers will point to the same location bypassing the check
"port\_begin > path\_begin", then the function will try to allocate
4294967294 bytes (-2 resulted by (size\_t)(path\_begin - port\_begin - 1))
for url->port which will fail and so the resulted NULL pointer will be
used as destination in the subsequent strncpy.
From utils/url.c:
int Url\_init(Url \* url, char \* urlname)
{
...
path\_begin = strstr(hostname\_begin, "/");
if (path\_begin == NULL) {
path\_len = 0;
}
else {
++path\_begin;
...
port\_begin = strstr(hostname\_begin, ":");
if ((port\_begin == NULL) || ((port\_begin > path\_begin) && (path\_begin != NULL))) {
...
if (port\_len) {
url->port = (char\*)malloc(port\_len+1);
strncpy(url->port, port\_begin, port\_len);
url->port[port\_len] = '\0';
}
