Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-6556:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `pageid` parameter of the `default.asp` script in WebSihirbazi v5.1.1. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application is directly using user-supplied input within SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*  **Blind SQL Injection:** The exploit examples provided suggest a blind SQL injection vulnerability. This means the attacker might not see the direct output of the query, but can infer information by observing changes in the application's behavior or timing.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the system.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  An attacker might be able to modify or delete data within the database, compromising data integrity.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By gaining access to user credentials, an attacker could elevate their privileges within the application or the system, leading to further compromise.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Depending on the database permissions and the systemâ€™s configuration, it is possible to achieve full compromise by executing system commands via the database system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `default.asp` page. The vulnerable parameter is `pageid`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target web server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the SQL injection vulnerability in the `pageid` parameter to construct a malicious payload.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The exploit examples do not seem to indicate a requirement for any prior authentication. This suggests the vulnerability may be exploitable without any prior knowledge or access.

**Technical Details**
The provided example URLs illustrate how the exploit works:
*   `http://[target]/[script_path]/default.asp?page=news&id=-2+union+all+select+0,kullaniciadi,sifre,3+from+user`
*   `http://[target]/[script_path]/default.asp?pageid=-7+union+all+select+0,1,2,kullaniciadi,sifre,5+from+user`
These payloads use the SQL `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to inject a malicious query into the original database query. The values returned by the injected query will be returned in place of the original query's results, this is leveraged to extract user credentials.

The exploit requires the injection of a SQL query through the vulnerable `pageid` parameter. It uses a `UNION` to append the attacker's payload to the original SQL query. The payload selects data from the `user` table and reveals `kullaniciadi` (username) and `sifre` (password) fields.
