Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization. Specifically, the login form does not properly handle user-provided input when magic quotes are disabled.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of proper input validation/sanitization on the username and potentially the password fields.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and log in as an administrator.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Submitting a crafted username and password through the login form.
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to know that magic quotes are turned off.

2. **Session Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application stores session files in a publicly accessible directory (`/tmp/`) without proper access controls, due to manual change of the session save path via `session_save_path()`.
    *  **Weaknesses:**  Session files are not stored in a secure location.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can steal session information (like session IDs) of other users, potentially leading to account hijacking.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing the session storage directory via a web browser.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  Knowledge of the session file storage location.

**Affected Version:**
*   PHP RPG version 0.8.0

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory mentions `magic_quotes_gpc` being removed in PHP6, which is an important context since it highlights that relying on this feature as a security measure is not reliable.
* The session storage is changed using `session_save_path()` in `init.php` which further details the technical root cause.

The information provided is more detailed than a typical CVE description, as it provides the specific attack vectors and the vulnerable code locations (e.g. `init.php` and the usage of `session_save_path()`).
