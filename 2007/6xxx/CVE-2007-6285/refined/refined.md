{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The autofs utility, by default, did not specify the 'nodev' mount option for the '-hosts' map, allowing local users with control of a remote NFS server to create special device files on the remote file system.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing 'nodev' mount option in the default configuration of autofs when mounting remote NFS file systems via the '-hosts' map. This allowed mounting of remote devices.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local user could gain access to important system devices by creating malicious device files on a remote NFS server and then mounting it via the default '-hosts' map, potentially leading to a compromise of machine integrity.",
  "Attack vectors": "A local user with control of a remote NFS server could create special device files on the remote filesystem which could be mounted using the default autofs '-hosts' map configuration.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access to the system and control of a remote NFS server."
