## Topic

Updated autofs5 technology preview packages that fix a security issue are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The autofs utility controls the operation of the automount daemon, which
automatically mounts file systems when you use them, and unmounts them when
you are not using them. This can include network file systems and CD-ROMs.
The autofs5 packages were made available as a technology preview in Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 4.6.

There was a security issue with the default configuration of autofs version
5, whereby the entry for the "-hosts" map did not specify the "nodev" mount
option. A local user with control of a remote NFS server could create
special device files on the remote file system, that if mounted using the
default "-hosts" map, could allow the user to access important system
devices. (CVE-2007-6285)

This issue is similar to CVE-2007-5964, which fixed a missing "nosuid"
mount option in autofs. Both the "nodev" and "nosuid" options should be
enabled to prevent a possible compromise of machine integrity.

Due to the fact that autofs always mounted "-hosts" map entries "dev" by
default, autofs has now been altered to always use the "nodev" option when
mounting from the default "-hosts" map. The "dev" option must be explicitly
given in the master map entry to revert to the old behavior. This change
affects only the "-hosts" map which corresponds to the "/net" entry in the
default configuration.

All autofs5 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
resolve this issue.

Red Hat would like to thank Tim Baum for reporting this issue.

## Topic

Updated autofs packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The autofs utility controls the operation of the automount daemon, which
automatically mounts file systems when you use them, and unmounts them when
you are not using them. This can include network file systems and CD-ROMs.

There was a security issue with the default configuration of autofs version
5, whereby the entry for the "-hosts" map did not specify the "nodev" mount
option. A local user with control of a remote NFS server could create
special device files on the remote file system, that if mounted using the
default "-hosts" map, could allow the user to access important system
devices. (CVE-2007-6285)

This issue is similar to CVE-2007-5964, which fixed a missing "nosuid"
mount option in autofs. Both the "nodev" and "nosuid" options should be
enabled to prevent a possible compromise of machine integrity.

Due to the fact that autofs always mounted "-hosts" map entries "dev" by
default, autofs has now been altered to always use the "nodev" option when
mounting from the default "-hosts" map. The "dev" option must be explicitly
given in the master map entry to revert to the old behavior. This change
affects only the "-hosts" map which corresponds to the "/net" entry in the
default configuration.

All autofs users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
resolve this issue.

Red Hat would like to thank Tim Baum for reporting this issue.

## Solution

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=426218#c0)  Josh Bressers    2007-12-19 12:50:25 UTC  ``` It was reported to secalert that the autofs defaults do not set the nodev NFS option.  [bug 410031](show_bug.cgi?id=410031 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2007-5964 autofs defaults don't restrict suid in /net") notes the missing nosuid option by default for the /net autofs filesystems, the fix for that issue did not take into account that there was also a missing nodev option for these filesystems.  Without the nodev option, it is possible for an attacker to mount a remote filesystem which could give them access to various devices that should normally have restricted access, such as /dev/mem, and various hardware devices.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Tim Baum for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=426218#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2007-12-20 19:19:59 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=426218#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2007-12-20 19:54:15 UTC  ``` Fixed now in affected version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux:    <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-1176.html>   <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-1177.html>    ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=426218#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-09 09:40:46 UTC  ``` Updates now available also in stable Fedora repositories:    <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F7/FEDORA-2007-4709>   <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F8/FEDORA-2007-4707>    ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=426218#c0)  Josh Bressers    2007-12-19 12:50:25 UTC  ``` It was reported to secalert that the autofs defaults do not set the nodev NFS option.  [bug 410031](show_bug.cgi?id=410031 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2007-5964 autofs defaults don't restrict suid in /net") notes the missing nosuid option by default for the /net autofs filesystems, the fix for that issue did not take into account that there was also a missing nodev option for these filesystems.  Without the nodev option, it is possible for an attacker to mount a remote filesystem which could give them access to various devices that should normally have restricted access, such as /dev/mem, and various hardware devices.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Tim Baum for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=426218#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2007-12-20 19:19:59 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=426218#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2007-12-20 19:54:15 UTC  ``` Fixed now in affected version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux:    <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-1176.html>   <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-1177.html>    ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=426218#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-09 09:40:46 UTC  ``` Updates now available also in stable Fedora repositories:    <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F7/FEDORA-2007-4709>   <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F8/FEDORA-2007-4707>    ``` |  |
