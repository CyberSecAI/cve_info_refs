- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack overflow in the `Start()` method of the SkyFex Client ActiveX control (SkyFexClient.ocx).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The ActiveX control's `Start()` method does not properly validate the length of input parameters, allowing for a stack buffer overflow when large strings are passed as arguments.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the application due to the stack overflow.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker could craft a malicious web page that uses the vulnerable ActiveX control and its `Start()` method with oversized parameters, triggering the vulnerability when a user visits the page with a vulnerable version of the software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage that is accessed by a user with a vulnerable version of SkyFex Client installed. The attacker must also understand the ActiveX control's parameters and how to trigger the overflow.
