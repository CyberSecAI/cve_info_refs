```
{
  "Root cause": "The `$contentid` variable in `pkinc/public/article.php` is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive information such as user credentials.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `contentid` parameter in a POST request to `include.php?path=article`.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted POST request with the vulnerable parameter. Magic quotes must be off on the server and there must be articles in the database."
