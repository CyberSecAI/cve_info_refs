Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-6471:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw in Phpay.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `config` parameter in `main.php` is vulnerable to LFI, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:**  Although the application attempts to sanitize the input, it uses weak regular expressions to filter out relative paths (`../`, `/`), backslashes (`\`) can bypass it on Windows systems. Additionally, it checks if `.inc.php` exists somewhere in the string which is also bypassed via crafted file path.
- **Use of `extract($_GET)`:** The use of `extract($_GET)` in the code allows an attacker to inject variables and bypass intended logic.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **File Disclosure:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, including configuration files, scripts, and sensitive data.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including a file with malicious code, especially within the admin directory, attackers can achieve RCE.
- **Compromise of Application:** Successfully exploiting the LFI can allow an attacker to completely compromise the web application.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out through crafted HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `config` parameter.
- **Bypassing Input Sanitization:** Attackers can use backslashes (`\`) instead of forward slashes (`/`) on Windows systems, and carefully craft the file path to include `.inc.php` at the beginning of the file path, bypassing the regex based filter.
- **Admin Folder RCE:** The attacker gains further control over the system by exploiting code execution vulnerabilities in the admin folder once the LFI vulnerability is triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of File Structure:** The attacker needs knowledge of the file paths of the server to exploit the LFI effectively, especially on a Windows system.
- **Malicious Code:** For RCE, the attacker would need to upload or have access to a malicious file that can be included via the LFI.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Windows systems due to the bypass with backslashes in paths.
- The presence of `extract($_GET)` simplifies exploitation.
- The patch that was intended to fix the issue, was not effective.
- The example payload shows how to include arbitrary files on windows systems through a crafted `config` parameter.
- The admin folder being protected by .htaccess is a necessary component, in order for RCE to be executed successfully.
