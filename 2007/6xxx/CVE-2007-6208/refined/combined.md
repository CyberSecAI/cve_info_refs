How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hi,
the sylprint.pl also shipped in an installation of the
package is prone to a symlink attack.
sylprint.pl:
213 $tmpfn="/tmp/sylprint.$ENV{'USER'}.$$";
214 open(TMP,">$tmpfn");
215 open(FIN,"<$ARGV[0]");
216 LN: while (<FIN>) {
217 >···$ln = $_;
218 >···foreach $n (@cabn) {
[...]
242 # print headers
243 if ($headers) {
244 >···print TMP "\n\n";

Since the process id is pretty predictable as well as the user name in
this case an attacker could create a symlink to the tmp file and thereby
overwriting arbitrary files owned by the user.
Opening with O_EXCL and raising an error would be sufficient from my
point of view.
Kind regards
Nico

This bug is going to be fixed.

Would it be too much to ask the submitter to handle security issues
privately until they're resolved, or is it more interesting to have
them published all over the place[*] when no solution is available?

Name: [CVE-2007-6208](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6208)
Status: Candidate
URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6208>
Reference: CONFIRM:<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=454089>

sylprint.pl in claws mail tools (claws-mail-tools) allows local users
to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the
sylprint.[USER].[PID] temporary file.

Please mention the CVE id in the changelog if you fix this bug (I suggesst by
removing this script from the package as upstream also wants to remove it).
Kind regards
Nico

To make it short yes. I do not share your policy for
handling security relevant bugs especially if you consider
that upstream authors are fairly often unresponsive and this
bug is of minor importance. This is no remote root exploit
so I don't see your problem. If you don't want people to
write about what you do, then you should not publish
software. What I did is seing a bug and using the BTS of my
distribution to report it, nothing more.

Kind regards
Nico

  This is not a upstream policy, is how most people expect security bugs to
be handled and is part of our Developers Reference [0]. I also know
confidentiality it's not required for minor bugs.

> that upstream authors are fairly often unresponsive and this
> bug is of minor importance.

  Yep I agree the bug has minor importance, but generalising on upstream
unresponsiveness as justification for not sending a notice is not a good
idea. Mainly because it makes you look like you don't think or read before
posting, specially when the upstream of that precise script is also the
package maintainer. It also gives arguments to upstreams on generalising how
stupid DDs can be... :-P

> This is no remote root exploit so I don't see your problem. If you don't

  I don't see your problem either in sending a private mail first, specially
when there's a explicit request to do it from upstream.

  Pretending you're 'just using the BTS' is even more stupid than the
previous justification or reveals a serious lack of knowledge about how
security bugs are spread.

  I know Colin's words were probably not in the best tone, but his request
is fair: nobody likes reading "There was no vendor-supplied solution at the
time of entry." in a security tracker when he had no opportunity to solve the
problem.

  Your bug report was good, there was no need to made stupid justifications,
and Colin wasn't saying the opposite, just requested coordination.

  BTW, the bug is already closed.

  regards,

I am aware of how to proceed with security bugs, however the

Well I had email conversation with nearly every claws
developer now about this and already had while they had a
vulnerable version on their website... I really have no
motivation to discuss this further, have a look in your own
team@claws mailbox.

Simply because I don't share this opinion.

Can you stop the trolling now? What is stupid is that I get
mails by every single claws-mails upstream developer asking
me to contact them first while a developer of them is
actually the Debian maintainer, this is stupid if you ask me
cause its your job to tell your fellow developers about
this. And seriously you guys should start fixing stuff
instead of being pissed off because it was spread about
security sites (which was not what I did) and being pissed
of because of a bad review in the Linux magazine (at least
thats what I got told by a fellow developer of you).

Then go and piss the guys of secwatch off because I am _NOT_
the one who wrote this text, thanks!

Yes and he did when I already got mails by other developers
stating and asking the same in a more or less unfriendlier
way:
Hi Nico
you could contact the team before to write
"There was no vendor-supplied solution at the time of entry."

Really, the whole discussion ended yesterday and now you really need
to give your additional words that don't help too?
You guys should really start working on things instead of wasting your time
with email.
And to be honest, I am not going to contact any of you guys if I find
some bug again, simple because you showed that you are not able to handle
this just because of some bad press.

Kind regards
Nico

Dude, it's not about bad press. It's about following procedures.
Anyway, do me a favour, leave security bugs to the people who do it
correctly.

All of the previous vulns have been much better handled:
<http://secunia.com/advisories/10061/>
<http://secunia.com/advisories/14774/>
<http://secunia.com/advisories/26550/>
<http://secunia.com/advisories/20476/>

We report the ones we find. What in this process makes you think we're
bothered about bad press?

Following whos procedures?

Do me a favour and leave security bugs to the people
actually doing security work in this distribution. Thanks.

Oh wait, you are comparing a low impact bug in a contrib
script with those bugs? You must be kidding or at least you seem to have no
clue about the impact of security bugs.

"  I know Colin's words were probably not in the best tone, but his request
is fair: nobody likes reading "There was no vendor-supplied solution at the
time of entry." in a security tracker when he had no opportunity to solve the
problem."

What else should this tell me? If you are really just pissed of because you had
no opportunity to fix this before it was on security sites: ok, I don't care,
hate me for this, thanks for the discussion.

Anyway, I am not going to answer any mail regarding this issue from now on
since I see it as a plain waste of time. Stop whining and do something useful with
yours as well.

Cheers
Nico

# Claws Mail: Insecure temporary file creation — GLSA **200801-03**

Claws Mail uses temporary files in an insecure manner, allowing for a
symlink attack.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/claws-mail** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.0.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.0.2-r1** |

### Background

Claws Mail is a GTK based e-mail client.

### Description

Nico Golde from Debian reported that the sylprint.pl script that is
part of the Claws Mail tools creates temporary files in an insecure
manner.

### Impact

A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct symlink
attacks to overwrite files with the privileges of the user running
Claws Mail.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Claws Mail users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/claws-mail-3.0.2-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
