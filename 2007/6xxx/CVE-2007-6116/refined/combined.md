| [Description](#c0)  Lars Hartmann    2007-11-22 09:44:30 UTC  ``` Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Wireshark, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).  The vulnerabilities are caused due to various errors (e.g. large loops with extreme memory consumption, endless loops, crashes, and buffer overflows) within the following: * SSL, ANSI MAP, Firebird/Interbase, NCP, HTTP, MEGACO, DCP ETSI, PPP, and Bluetooth SDP dissectors * when processing a malformed MP3 or iSeries (OS/400) Communication trace file * when processing a malformed DNP or RPC Portmap packet  These can be exploited to crash Wireshark or consume large amounts of system resources by e.g. parsing a specially crafted packet that is either captured off the wire or loaded via a capture file.  The vulnerabilities are reported in various versions from 0.8.16 through 0.99.6. Other versions may also be affected.  Solution: Update to version 0.99.7.  Provided and/or discovered by: Stefan Esser (SSL dissector) Beyond Security (DNP packet) Fabiodds (iSeries (OS/400) Communication trace file) Peter Leeming (ANSI MAP) Steve (Firebird/Interbase) ainsley (RPC Portmap)  Original Advisory: <http://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2007-03.html>  Reproducible: Always ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Lars Hartmann    2007-11-24 17:17:26 UTC  ``` maintainers - please provide an updated ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-25 15:08:29 UTC  ``` Upgrading to B2 because it might be possible to execute code according to the CVE entries:  CVE-2007-6111 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-6111>):   Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) allow   remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via (1) a crafted MP3   file or (2) unspecified vectors to the NCP dissector.  CVE-2007-6112 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-6112>):   Buffer overflow in the PPP dissector Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) 0.99.6   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly   execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors.  CVE-2007-6113 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-6113>):   Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) 0.10.12 to 0.99.6 allows remote attackers to   cause a denial of service (long loop) via a malformed DNP packet.  CVE-2007-6114 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-6114>):   Multiple buffer overflows in Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) 0.99.0 through   0.99.6 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and   possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) the SSL dissector or (2) the iSeries   (OS/400) Communication trace file parser.  CVE-2007-6115 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-6115>):   Buffer overflow in the ANSI MAP dissector for Wireshark (formerly Ethereal)   0.99.5 to 0.99.6, when running on unspecified platforms, allows remote   attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code   via unknown vectors.  CVE-2007-6116 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-6116>):   The Firebird/Interbase dissector in Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) 0.99.6   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop or crash)   via unknown vectors.  CVE-2007-6117 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-6117>):   Unspecified vulnerability in the HTTP dissector for Wireshark (formerly   Ethereal) 0.10.14 to 0.99.6 has unknown impact and remote attack vectors   related to chunked messages.  CVE-2007-6118 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-6118>):   The MEGACO dissector in Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) 0.9.14 to 0.99.6 allows   remote attackers to cause a denial of service (long loop and resource   consumption) via unknown vectors.  CVE-2007-6119 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-6119>):   The DCP ETSI dissector in Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) 0.99.6 allows remote   attackers to cause a denial of service (long loop and resource consumption)   via unknown vectors.  CVE-2007-6120 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-6120>):   The Bluetooth SDP dissector Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) 0.99.2 to 0.99.6   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via   unknown vectors.  CVE-2007-6121 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-6121>):   Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) 0.8.16 to 0.99.6 allows remote attackers to   cause a denial of service (crash) via a malformed RPC Portmap packet.  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Peter Volkov (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-25 19:59:45 UTC  ``` Lars, there is no official release yet. I've prepared ebuild for pre-release in my overlay  <http://overlays.gentoo.org/dev/pva/browser/net-analyzer/wireshark> so if you wish to test, please, do it. I'm interested in reports.  On the other hand this package is known to have new vulnerabilities every new release is out. After reading this mail <http://www.wireshark.org/lists/wireshark-dev/200711/msg00055.html> I've got a feeling that the it will ready very soon and so I think it's not necessary to bump pre-release in our tree. We'll bump new version as soon as upstream considers it ready... ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-27 01:19:53 UTC  ``` Upgrading again since these flaws might allow root compromise.  Peter, please have a look at the new packaging options described in section "3. Privileges" here:   <http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/wireshark/trunk/doc/README.packaging>  It allows to install some components of wireshark (TShark and dumpcap) setuid root, so the dissector part of wireshark is not run with root privileges. Upstream encourages packages to enable this feature, but make the files only executable by a certain unix group.  Would that be an option we could introduce with the new wireshark release's ebuild? ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-28 10:18:39 UTC  ``` Release delayed until Dec. 5/6.  <http://www.wireshark.org/lists/wireshark-dev/200711/msg00418.html> ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Peter Volkov (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-13 10:44:01 UTC  ``` I've updated ebuild in my overlay to _pre2. <http://overlays.gentoo.org/dev/pva/browser/net-analyzer/wireshark> Everybody are welcome to test it.  Robert, it contains improvements you mentioned. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-18 23:40:10 UTC  ``` Wireshark 0.99.7 was finally released.  Peter, thanks for taking note of the new setuid feature. However, it is important that do not install that file the way wireshark leaves it (setuid root), because that way every user on the system can execute it and sniff packets, which usually is a huge security leak.  In order to use the setuid feature, the best way to go is to set the setuid files o-x, bug g+x and change the group to "wireshark" -- that group then contains all users trusted to sniff packets. Or use another net analyzer group if available. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Peter Volkov (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-20 14:19:43 UTC  ``` Robert, thank you again. Of course its better to allow only trusted users sniff the traffic. New version with some cleanups and your suggestions is in portage. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-20 17:48:59 UTC  ``` Seems you missed to add a file. Not ready for stable testing :-) ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Peter Volkov (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-20 18:06:13 UTC  ``` I was 5 seconds earlier. The [bug 202866](show_bug.cgi?id=202866 "RESOLVED FIXED - net-analyzer/wireshark-0.99.7 failed patch") is fixed :) ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-22 21:52:49 UTC  ``` Additional issues already covered by 0.99.7  CVE-2007-6451     Unspecified vulnerability in the CIP dissector in Wireshark     (formerly Ethereal) 0.9.14 to 0.99.6 allows remote attackers     to cause a denial of service (crash) via unknown vectors     that trigger allocation of large amounts of memory.  CVE-2007-6450     The RPL dissector in Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) 0.9.8 to     0.99.6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service     (infinite loop) via unknown vectors.  CVE-2007-6441     The WiMAX dissector in Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) 0.99.6     allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)     via unknown vectors related to "unaligned access on some     platforms."  CVE-2007-6439     Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) 0.99.6 allows remote attackers     to cause a denial of service (infinite or large loop) via     the (1) IPv6 or (2) USB dissector, which can trigger     resource consumption or a crash. NOTE: this identifier     originally included Firebird/Interbase, but it is already     covered by CVE-2007-6116. The DCP ETSI issue is already     covered by CVE-2007-6119.  CVE-2007-6438     Unspecified vulnerability in the SMB dissector in Wireshark     (formerly Ethereal) 0.99.6 allows remote attackers to cause     a denial of service via unknown vectors. NOTE: this     identifier originally included MP3 and NCP, but those issues     are already covered by CVE-2007-6111.  ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-22 22:48:58 UTC  ``` Peter, your new ebuild looks fine. Thanks a lot for the fast reactions.  Arches, please test and mark stable net-analyzer/wireshark-0.99.7. Target keywords : "alpha amd64 hppa ia64 ppc ppc64 sparc x86"  ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Brent Baude (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-23 04:38:34 UTC  ``` ppc and ppc64 done ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Markus Meier   gentoo-dev  2007-12-23 14:07:17 UTC  ``` x86 stable ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Jeroen Roovers (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-24 01:58:19 UTC  ``` Stable for HPPA. ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Raúl Porcel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-24 12:10:52 UTC  ``` alpha/ia64/sparc stable ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Peter Weller (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-26 10:58:20 UTC  ``` amd64 done ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Tobias Heinlein (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-26 11:44:34 UTC  ``` GLSA request filed. ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-30 17:39:51 UTC  ``` GLSA 200712-23, thank you. ``` |  |

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark or Ethereal crash or use
up available memory by injecting a purposefully malformed packet
onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet
trace file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 0.99.7.

If are running Wireshark 0.99.6 or Ethereal 0.99.0 or earlier and
cannot upgrade, you can work around each of the problems listed above
by doing the following:

* Disable the HTTP, DCP ETSI, SSL, DHCP/BOOTP, and MMS dissectors.
  + Select *Analyze→Enabled Protocols...* from the menu.+ Make sure "ANSI MAP", "BTSDP", "DCP (ETSI)", "DNP 3.0", "FB/IPB GDS DB", "HTTP", "MEGACO", "NCP", "PPP", "SSL"
      are un-checked.+ Click "Save", then click "OK".

# Wireshark: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200712-23**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Wireshark, allowing for
the remote execution of arbitrary code and a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/wireshark** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.99.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.99.7** |

### Background

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer with a graphical front-end.

### Description

Multiple buffer overflows and infinite loops were discovered in
multiple dissector and parser components, including those for MP3 and
NCP (CVE-2007-6111), PPP (CVE-2007-6112), DNP (CVE-2007-6113), SSL and
iSeries (OS/400) Communication traces (CVE-2007-6114), ANSI MAP
(CVE-2007-6115), Firebird/Interbase (CVE-2007-6116), HTTP
(CVE-2007-6117), MEGACO (CVE-2007-6118), DCP ETSI (CVE-2007-6119),
Bluetooth SDP (CVE-2007-6120), RPC Portmap (CVE-2007-6121), SMB
(CVE-2007-6438), IPv6 amd USB (CVE-2007-6439), WiMAX (CVE-2007-6441),
RPL (CVE-2007-6450), CIP (CVE-2007-6451). The vulnerabilities were
discovered by Stefan Esser, Beyond Security, Fabiodds, Peter Leeming,
Steve and ainsley.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially crafted packets on a network
being monitored with Wireshark or entice a user to open a specially
crafted file, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running Wireshark (which might be the
root user), or a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Wireshark users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/wireshark-0.99.7"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- xdg-utils command injection
xdg-open and xdg-email didn't properly check their arguments.
Remote attackers could send prepared documents or mails with bad
links to users, where on activation of those links code could have
been executed. (CVE-2008-0386).
- clamav 0.92.1 security update
The clamav version was upgraded to 0.92.1 fixing numerous flaws
including some security problems (CVE-2008-0318, CVE-2008-0728).
Please note that the version number of the clamav library has changed
with version 0.92. Programs linked against older libclamav therefore
need to be updated as well.
clamav was upgraded on all affected products.
Updates were already released Friday 15th.
- wireshark 0.99.5 security release
This update fixes several security bugs in wireshark that can be
used to crash the application and to possibly execute arbitrary
code remotely.
Security issues tracked by the CVE IDs:
CVE-2007-6111, CVE-2007-6112, CVE-2007-6113
CVE-2007-6114, CVE-2007-6115, CVE-2007-6116
CVE-2007-6117, CVE-2007-6118, CVE-2007-6119
CVE-2007-6120, CVE-2007-6121, CVE-2007-6438
CVE-2007-6439, CVE-2007-6441, CVE-2007-6450
CVE-2007-6451
have been fixed.
Wireshark and on older products Ethereal were updated.
Please note that updates were already delivered on Jan 21st, they
were just not listed yet in any advisory.
- pcre utf-8 buffer overflow problem
Specially crafted regular expressions could lead to a buffer overflow
in the pcre library. Applications using pcre to process regular
expressions from untrusted sources could therefore potentially be
exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-0674)
This problem affected only openSUSE 10.3 and was fixed there.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

provided that the advisory is not modified in any way. In particular, the
clear text signature should show proof of the authenticity of the text.
