Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-6490:

**CVE Description:**
The provided content does not contain the official CVE description.

**Vulnerability Details (Extracted from Exploit-DB):**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application improperly includes files based on user-supplied input via the `dir[classes]` and `error` parameters.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** User-supplied input in the guestbook feature is not properly sanitized, allowing injection of malicious scripts.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The application does not validate requests to change passwords, allowing an attacker to force users to change their password.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Unvalidated Input:** The application fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied input, leading to RFI and XSS vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `dir` parameter within `sitemap.xml.php` and the `error` parameter within `errors.php` are used directly in `include` statements. Additionally, `gb_mail`, `gb_name` and `gb_text` parameters are not sanitized.
    *   **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The password change functionality does not implement CSRF protection mechanisms, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **RFI:** An attacker can include malicious code from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other client-side attacks.
    *   **CSRF:** An attacker can force a user to change their password, potentially locking them out of their account.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **RFI:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `sitemap.xml.php` with a malicious `dir[classes]` parameter, or to `errors.php` with a malicious `error` parameter.
    *   **XSS:** Injecting malicious javascript into the `gb_mail`, `gb_name` or `gb_text` fields in the guestbook functionality.
    *   **CSRF:** Embedding a crafted form with hidden fields into a malicious webpage that, when visited by an authenticated user, submits a request to change their password.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    *   For XSS, the attacker needs to lure a victim to view a page with injected XSS code.
    *   For CSRF, the attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to visit a malicious site that performs the action.

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit-db entry mentions that there are multiple RFI vulnerabilities and permanent XSS issues.
* The exploit-db entry provides specific URLs and code snippets that can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities.
