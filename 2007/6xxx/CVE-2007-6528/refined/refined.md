Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-6528:

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient sanitization of the "movies" parameter in the `tiki-listmovies.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Directory Traversal: The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to manipulate the "movies" parameter using ".." sequences, enabling them to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Access: An attacker can read the first 1000 bytes of any file on the server that the webserver user has access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attacker sends a specially crafted GET request to `tiki-listmovies.php` with a malicious "movies" parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote access to the vulnerable TikiWiki instance.
- No authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `movie` parameter in `tiki-listmovies.php`.
- An example exploit URL is `http://www.vulnsite.com/tiki-listmovies.php?movie=../../../../../../etc/passwd%001234`.
- The `%00` null byte is used to truncate the file path and prevent errors when accessing the file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in TikiWiki versions prior to 1.9.9.
- A quick protection measure is to erase the file `tiki-listmovies.php`, if not used by the application.
