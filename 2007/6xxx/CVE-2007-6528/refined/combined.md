### Custom Share Module 0.1dev

###### Page actions

 [Print](tiki-print.php?page=ReleaseProcess199)

# [ReleaseProcess199](ReleaseProcess199 "refresh")

# Release Process 1.9.9

This release on the 1.9 branch is motivated by 2 improvements, first the release-check and also various security fixes as we had 3 diffferent analysts that reported security flaws to the security group, approximatively the same day, which is quite convenient. As this is a security release, it's done quite fast in emergency.

This release process began 3 days ago with security reports, handled by the security group, under release management of mose.

## Release checks

This new feature adds 2 options in general admin panel, to enable/disable remote checks and to setup the frequecy of those checks. The checking of a new version is done with a simple http request on tikiwiki.org site, when someone with admin perms displays any admin panel.

When the check is done and a new version is found, a message is displayed in admin panels to warn there is something new, and then no further checks are performed anymore (until upgrade).

This feature is enabled by default, which is motivated by the fact that we know that people don't usually follow the Tikiwiki community activity and they take time to upgrade, just because they don't know they should (especially for security release).

## Security fixes

We have 4 security fixes in that version.

* Jesus Olmos Gonzalez, from <http://www.isecauditors.com>, found a possible problem of transversal path in tiki-listmovies.php
* Mesut Timur, from <http://www.h-labs.org>, reported an XSS vulnerability in tiki-special\_chars.php
* redflo (from security group) also took the occasion to find other flaws, in tiki-edit\_css.php, tiki-list\_games.php, and tiki-g-admin\_shared\_source.php

### Quick security protection

If you can't upgrade, you can secure your versiobn of tikiwiki by:

* disable deatures : edit css, games, galaxia
* erase files tiki-listmovies.php (which is not used except very exceptionaly by people that know their stuff) and tiki-special\_chars.php (which is used in quicktags to popup a small widget to input special characters with odd accents).

## Changes

* wikiplugin group backported from 1.10
* improvement of wiki help on editpage
* new forum import feature (from tiki to tiki forums)
* some galaxia improvement
* module tail moved to mods
* fix in tracker ratings
* start of a new translation: bulgarian (bg)
* more translation for portuguese brazilian (pt-br)
* fixes in french (fr) translation

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# TikiWiki: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200801-10**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in TikiWiki, some of them
having unknown impact.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/tikiwiki** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.9.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.9.9** |

### Background

TikiWiki is an open source content management system written in PHP.

### Description

* Jesus Olmos Gonzalez from isecauditors reported insufficient
  sanitization of the "movies" parameter in file tiki-listmovies.php
  (CVE-2007-6528).
* Mesut Timur from H-Labs discovered that the
  input passed to the "area\_name" parameter in file
  tiki-special\_chars.php is not properly sanitised before being returned
  to the user (CVE-2007-6526).
* redflo reported multiple
  unspecified vulnerabilities in files tiki-edit\_css.php,
  tiki-list\_games.php, and tiki-g-admin\_shared\_source.php
  (CVE-2007-6529).

### Impact

A remote attacker can craft the "movies" parameter to run a directory
traversal attack through a ".." sequence and read the first 1000 bytes
of any arbitrary file, or conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
through the "area\_name" parameter. This attack can be exploited to
execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session,
allowing for the theft of browser session data or cookies in the
context of the affected web site. The impacts of the unspecified
vulnerabilities are still unknown.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All TikiWiki users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/tikiwiki-1.9.9"
```
### References

* [CVE-2007-6526](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6526)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
