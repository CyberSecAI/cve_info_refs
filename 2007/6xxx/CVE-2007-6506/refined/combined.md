**Vulnerable App:**

```
Advisory: /////////

There is another remotely exploitable flaw within software preinstalled
in HP notebook machines. This time, the culprit is automatic software
update tool provided by the vendor.The Potential exploitation may lead
to user files loss or altering vital system files (e.g. kernel), thus
leaving PC unbootable.

Overview: /////////

The flaw is located in the software called HP Software Update shipped
with the HP notebooks to support automatic software updates and critical
vulnerability patching. One of the ActiveX controls deployed by default
by the vendor contains an insecure method giving a potential attacker
the remote system arbitrary file write access.

Impact: ///////

Remote user files contents corruption Remote system kernel files damage
/ Operating System DoS condition

Attack vectors: ///////////////

There are two main attack vector schemes:

- inducing remote user to launch WWW link after obtaining the
information about the location of an arbitrary file(s) locations/names
in the remote system. After clicking the link the files contents will be
unrecoverably destroyed. This attack vector thus requires additional
social engineering of the vitim to acquire exact name and location of
the potential attack target files. - inducing remote user to launch WWW
link resulting in corruption of vital Operating System files, leaving
the system unusable. This attack vector DOESN'T require any additional
victim social engineering, because the system files are always placed in
the predictable locations.

Technical details: //////////////////

The vulnerable ActiveX control EngineRules.dll is a component of HP
Software Updates system designed by the vendor.

It has assigned CLSID: 7CB9D4F5-C492-42A4-93B1-3F7D6946470D and is by
default included to "Safe for Scripting" OLE components, that allows
full execution scripting access to the control methods from within the
browser.

The default control installation path is C:\Program
Files\Hewlett-Packard\eSupportDiags\RulesEngine.dll

The control is used by the the HP Software Updates software's
HPWUCli.exe client application to enumerate, load and store available
software patches information. The HPWUCli.exe binary is located in the
directory: C:\Program Files\HP\HP Software Update\

The control may also be used by a remote WWW service, such as
Hewlett-Packard online software update service.

The potentialy insecure method is: void SaveToFile(String dataFilePath);

This method is used to store the software patch specific data (version,
remote location, vendor name, software description) in the binary file
beginning with the 32bit integer value containing the actual patches
count stored in the data file.

The problem lies in the lack of distinguish between local and global
data file area in this control. Both LoadDataFromFile() method and
SaveDataToFile() method have an access to the entire file system data
area, therefore any arbitrary user file can be accessed remotely using
one of these methods by a remote entity. Use the SaveDataToFile() can be
exploited to store the empty-by-initialize software patch data in the
existing file, which will result in previous file contents loss and
resetting it to 4 zero-bytes, describing a zero-size patch.

Noticing a specific vulnerability location (vendor's software update
system), simple disabling of the vulnerable control by the vendor's
patch (like in the other HP software vulnerbility case - HPInfo) would
result in the machine software update system compromise in this case and
would leave the user vulnerable to the future security issues.

Therefore reimplemetation of the update system and/or vulnerable control
local data area implementation is strongly recommended.

Remote Kernel Wreckage Exploit //////////////////////////////

Using this flaw one can construct an armed exploit, able for example to
destroy remote system kernel files and make the remote machine
UNBOOTABLE. The exploit is using vulnerable SaveToFile() to overwrite
the NT System kernel files with the 4 zero bytes. The target are memory
mapped ntoskrnl.exe and ntkrnlpa.exe kernel files which don't have a
write lock set on them and may be opened for write. Although Windows NT
system contains a protection for this kind of activity (system files
overwrite) it can be fooled by overwriting simultanously: system binary
files backup directory (\System32\DllCache\) actual system kernel files
(\System32\) and the Driver Backup directory (\Windows\Driver Cache\)
kernel files.

After the execution it will store an zero-initialized patch information
using SaveToFile() method sequentially to ntoskrnl.exe, ntkrnlpa.exe,
ntkrnlmp.exe ,ntkrpamp.exe NT kernel files , first in the
System32\DllCache\ directory, second to \System32\ directory and finally
to Windows\Driver Cache\ dir. After the very next OS shutdown, machine
will not be bootable anymore.

The exploit code has been attached to the end of this advisory. NOTE
however that it is provided ONLY as a Proof of Concept code and has been
released ONLY to estimate the impact level of the issue.

Vulnerable Software: ////////////////////

HP Software Update client v3.0.8.4 RulesEngine.dll ActiveX CTL v1.0

Internet Explorer 6.0 Internet Explorer 7.0

Windows XP Home Windows XP Pro Windows 2000 Windows 2003 Windows Vista

Vulnerable Hardware ///////////////////

Every HP notebook machine containing the HP Software Updates application
is vulnerable. It is possible that the vulnerable machine model list
disclosed by the vendor as a confirmation to the previous issue
concerning HP laptops - "HP Info Center" case, will be similar in this
case.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[Ian Lamont](http://blogs.computerworld.com/lamont) writes *"A security researcher calling himself porkythepig has published attack code that can supposedly [brick most HP and Compaq laptops](http://computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9053818&intsrc=hm_list). The exploit uses an ActiveX control in HP's Software Update. It would 'let an attacker corrupt Windows' kernel files, making the laptop unbootable, or with a little more effort, allow hacks that would result in a PC hijack or malware infection.' The same researcher last week outlined a batch of [additional vulnerabilities in HP and Compaq laptops](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9052758), for which HP later issued patches."*

  Two points about the article's headline:

  1) The linked article does not describe a successful bricking. You can pop in your recovery CD & away you go.

  2) This is a software problem, not a hardware problem. I doubt this exploit is going to work on my (old & crappy) HP sempron laptop, seeing as its dual booting Debian & OS X.

  A better headline would be "Exploit found in HP update software" - but I guess that's just not that ad-revenue generating.

    It's annoying how the word brick has lost all meaning recently. If this exploit actually allowed bricking that would be huge news. But it doesn't. A computer that merely needs its OS repaired/reinstalled is *not bricked*. Slashdot editors, please figure that out already.

        There used to be a virus that slipped past the OS and triggered a BIOS flash on certain boards, and flashed the virus into the BIOS. The only ways to get it out were to buy a new MB, buy a new BIOS chip from the MB or BIOS manufacturer, flash the chip in a dedicated chip data loader, or replace it temporarily with a friend's BIOS chip, boot, swap out the chips on the live board, reflash, and hope you didn't fry the board or the chip. The board generally wasn't dual-BIOS, and worst of all IIRC was that the BIOS chip for many of the affected boards was soldered instead of socketed. The virus was called CIH or Chernobyl.

        There was back in the days of DOS and ESDI, MFM, and early IDE drives, when it was the user's responsibility to run a drive head parking utility (properly configured for the right cylinder count for parking out past the edge of the drive) before physically moving the machine because auto-parking wasn't built into drives yet, a virus that did something really nasty. It'd take the cylinder count for your drive, cut that in half, set your park cylinder to that number, and tell the drive to park and shut down. The heads would move to the center of the platters, the spindle would slow down on its way to stopping, the air cushion between head and platter went away, and the heads plowed into the platters either then or when the drive would spin back up. I don't recall the name of this one.

        Either of these could be considered bricking actual hardware, but you probably won't ever have to worry about Chernobyl and the other is obsolete.

          Don't forget about the trojan that would blow up your IBM CGA monitor by resetting the display frequency to an unsupported value. It definately let the smoke out, as you could smell the result.

      Damn straight, I'm glad you got the comment in early. Bricking is one of the last pure computing terms around. Memory, CPU, Operating System, code, hack, have all come to mean a lot of things, but bricking still has specific meaning. If you can do anything at all to the device without touching the hardware to make it run again it is not bricked. Even if it voids the warranty. Please please please don't confuse the meaning, bricking is game over, everything else is everything else.

        I was under the impression that it was bricked if you couldn't bring it back without hacking the hardware. Like with the OpenWRT routers, they are said to be bricked if you install a bad firmware update but you can JTAG them and potentially bring them back. And that context has been around as long as I can remember.

          Exactly. The term implies that, from the perspective of its intended purpose, the device is as functional as a brick.

        About twelve years ago I had a meeting with a guy who used "brick" for "image", as in imaging PCs.

        "Will your company brick all our desktops?"
        "WTF are you talking about?"

        After it got straightened out, he insisted that this was mainframe speak. I've never heard the term used that way again, though.

           *Notwithstanding its actual existing specific meaning, "bricked" is fairly obviously now a slang term for when something electronic is, temporarily or permanently, inoperative.*

          No, it is being used by some headline writers like that. But not anyone knowledgeable. It still means "permanently" , not "temporarily" fucked. In this article, for instance, the post by the "hacker" who found this never uses the word "brick". Only the sensationalist headline writer.

      Well, it's just a variation of what people used to say when their OS got corrupted and they said "my hard drive crashed". It just meant "My PC wouldn't boot".

      On the other hand, most people are so mystified by computers that the difference between software and hardware is not obvious and they don't care.

The point is, if you can use the computer after the exploit, it is not a brick, so it is not \*bricked\*. If you lost your documents or not has nothing to do with it.

      Popping the hard drive in to one of those USB enclosures and copying your data files onto another machine before running the recovery CD looks after that. The summary says the exploit just corrupts Windows' kernel files. Assuming it doesn't do anything further to make your data unreadable, there is no reason to lose any data.

          HPs and Compaqs are the topic of TFA. These have either come with a set of recovery media or (more recently) a program that will burn them to CD-R or DVD-R. If the former is the case, you're all set. If the latter, and you didn't bother to make recovery discs, whose fault is that? (IIRC, it'll nag you to make them until you get around to it.)

          Lately, they've taken to putting an installable copy of Windows on one disc and installable copies of drivers and apps on the other disc(s)...that's nice for controlling how much shovelware gets loaded back on. It's not as fast as a Ghost (or whatever) image, but it's much more controllable.

          Does it encrypt the data, or just set the folder ACLs so it can't be accessed?

          If it's just ACLs, then you can read it from anywhere. Linux's NTFS support ignores ACLs for example, because it's going to have a very hard time trying to make them map to anything sensible. On another Windows box the SUIDs will be unknown but respected, but you should be able to take ownership of the folder and reset the permissions.

          If it IS encrypted, that's another matter.

  This is NOT bricking. The OS is simply disabled and can be reinstalled/system repaired whatever.

  Bricking means rendering the device completely inert and beyond normal repair methods.

      Ahh, it's not at all, that reminds me of the old joke:

      A couple goes on vacation to a fishing resort. The husband likes to fish at the crack of dawn. The wife likes to read. One morning the husband returns after several hours of fishing and decides to take a short nap. Although she isn't familiar with the lake, the wife decides to take the boat. She motors out a short distance, anchors, and continues to read her book. Along comes the game warden in his boat. He pulls up alongside her and says,"Good morning, Ma'am, what are you doing?" "Reading my book," she replies, thinking isn't that obvious? "You're in a restricted fishing area," he informs her. "But officer, I'm not fishing. Can't you see that?" "Yes, but you have all the equipment. I'll have to take you in and write you up." "If you do that, I'll have to charge you with rape," says the woman. "But I haven't even touched you," says the game warden. "That's true, but you do have all the equipment."

      The capability does not equal the crime, thankfully, so while you might put the laptop in a position it's brickable, it's not. Also, with dual bios's, bricking something like a laptop requires quite a bit of effort!

  Corrupting a Windows install does NOT BRICK A GOD DAMNED LAPTOP. You can reinstall Windows and it will work. Therefore it is not a brick, it is not bricked, it has no aspect of brickishness, not even a hint of brickening.

  What the HELL is wrong with you morons??? Do you even read Slashdot discussions? This has been pointed out over and over and over again.

  Bricking involves killing something dead in such a way that it becomes, in effect, an expensive paperweight or 'brick' if you will. As you are clearly retarded, let me explain that a 'brick' is typically a rectangular piece of clay or similar material hardened in a furnace and used to construct buildings and other structures, and usually has no functionality beyond this. Unlike the device in this story, reinstalling Windows on an actual brick will not lead to increased capabilities.

  Bricking refers to rendering a device inoperable in a more significant way than corrupting data on a hard drive. These machines can still be booted from external media and restored. A truly bricked device would have its firmware corrupted or suffer some sort of damage not easily repaired without specialist tools.

    The implications of your statement depend on how you define "specialist tool". One might consider a Windows recovery CD a specialist tool. A lot of PCs don't come with one, instead coming with a recovery partition that a trojan can easily erase once it elevates itself to administrative privileges. Besides, a lot of recovery CDs and recovery partitions will erase all user documents when run, and automated backup is also a specialist tool.

  It sounds like the user needs to be using Internet Explorer in order to be vulnerable. I doubt anything happens on Firefox or other browser since there is purposely no ActiveX support there.

  Also I note that the exploit description itself never uses the inaccurate word "brick".

  The story is yet another illustration of how dangerous ActiveX is. This is not the first example and it probably won't be the last. So many other things depend on or otherwise utilize activex... some are highly security sensitive like in the case of ADP. I cannot understand why, after all these years of examples why Microsoft hasn't recalled the use of the technology as inherently dangerous. But really, it's worse than that. It breaks the premise of the web. The use of the web is not supposed to be limited to a certain hardware specification under a certain software configuration... this is irrelevant, of course, to the dangers pushed upon the users who are often required to use it.

    1) Bricked is the wrong word.

    2) This hilights the dangers of any holes in a sandbox. The only secure way to design a sandbox is for there to be no mechanism from inside the sandbox to request access outside it... whether by installing a plugin, executing an external application, or otherwise elevating privileges. Even if the request is normally denied, the existince of that mechanism itself creates a new class of attacks.

    The corollary to point two is that ActiveX is not just a security hole, it's a different \*kind\* of security hole.

    On the other hand, all three of the most common browsers have a mechanism to request access outside the sandbox. None of them are as bad as ActiveX, but they're all unnecessary.

    \* Any browser on Windows is subject to URI quoting attacks on helper applications, due to the lack of a guaranteed quote-safe command line and the use of a single set of helper bindings for trusted and untrusted sources.

    \* LaunchServices on OS X duplicates the second problem as well.

    \* Firefox and Safari both allow web pages to request plugins be installed: XPI in Firefox and Dashboard plugins in Safari on OSX. They both wrap these interfaces in multiple levels of "approval dialogs", but my experience is that there are too many people who can be relied upon to eventually hit "go ahead and infect me" by reflex.

    \* Safari and Internet Explorer can both be made to, with various amounts of approval dialogs, open downloaded documents automatically. Safari used to do this by default but thankfully it's now an option... but really that capability should not be there at all.

    None of these holes in the sandbox actually make things more convenient for users. They look like they might, but it's actually easier to download a document or a plugin and than (as a separate step) request that it be opened or installed from a file browser or from a download manager, because making the operation asynchronous and deliberate like that means you don't have to go crazy with approval dialogs, because you're not running the risk of an unexpected dialog coming up for a user with an itchy mouse button...

  ...I must propose that Slashdot editors are involved in a conspiracy. To wit: In the past few months or so, we have had at least three submissions that have incorrectly used the term "brick" to describe a problem with typically simple solutions- distinctly not problems without solution. Anyone interested enough to submit an article to Slashdot would know the meaning of the term. Therefore, the only explanation is that the editors are cultivating the submissions in a way calculated to stimulate numerous off topic posts highlighting the improper use of the term, in turn increasing the traffic in order to generate add revenue. What's the definition of troll?

  Come on people. I know it's all sensational and stuff to talk about bricking, but this ain't bricking. Bricking is when the device is now as "useful as a brick" or could literally be used only as a paper weight or a door stop. When it cannot be recovered or fixed, **that's** a brick. This is just a fouled up machine. Which viruses have been giving us since the early 90s when hard drives became standard in PCs.

  It's like there's a bunch of kiddies out there who heard all the sensation about iPhones getting bricked (now that seemed like a genuine brick for quite a while) and now think that *the* cool term for screwed up is now "brick". Use some precision, for crying out loud.
