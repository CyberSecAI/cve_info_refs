- Root cause of vulnerability: The application was not properly invalidating user sessions upon logout, allowing users to bypass authentication by using browser history.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insecure session management, specifically the lack of proper session invalidation upon logout.
- Impact of exploitation: Unauthorized access to the application without providing credentials.
- Attack vectors: Navigation using the browser's back or forward buttons or selecting a historical path from the browser's history dropdown after logging out.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be a user who has previously logged into the application, logged out, and then uses the browser's history to attempt to reaccess the application.
