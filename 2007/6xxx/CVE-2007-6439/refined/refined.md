Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- Multiple buffer overflows and infinite loop vulnerabilities exist in various dissectors and parsers within Wireshark. These flaws are triggered when processing malformed network packets or capture files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflows:**
  - SSL dissector
  - iSeries (OS/400) Communication trace file parser
  - ANSI MAP dissector
  - PPP dissector
- **Infinite Loops:**
  - Firebird/Interbase dissector
  - Bluetooth SDP dissector
  - RPL dissector
- **Excessive Looping:**
  - DNP dissector
  - MEGACO dissector
  - DCP ETSI dissector
  - IPv6 dissector
  - USB dissector
- **Crashes:**
  - NCP dissector
  - HTTP dissector (when decoding chunked messages)
  - RPC Portmap dissector
  - SMB dissector
  - WiMAX dissector (due to unaligned access)
  - CIP dissector (due to excessive memory allocation)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By triggering infinite loops or excessive resource consumption, attackers can cause Wireshark to become unresponsive or crash.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Buffer overflows could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Wireshark.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Certain vulnerabilities could lead to excessive memory consumption.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Packets:** A remote attacker can send specially crafted packets over the network, which are captured and parsed by Wireshark.
- **Capture Files:** An attacker can create a malformed capture file and entice a user to open it using Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to either send malicious network traffic that will be captured or convince a user to open a crafted capture file with a vulnerable version of Wireshark. No special privileges are required to conduct the attack.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerabilities affected Wireshark versions 0.8.16 up to and including 0.99.6.
- The vulnerabilities were discovered by multiple researchers and organizations, including Stefan Esser, Beyond Security, and Fabiodds.
- Wireshark version 0.99.7 was released to address these issues.
