The content is related to CVE-2007-6724.

**Root Cause:**
The Vidalia bundle, prior to version 0.1.2.18, shipped with an insecure Privoxy configuration. Specifically, certain options were enabled by default which allowed remote manipulation of the proxy settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `enable-remote-toggle`, `enable-edit-actions` options, and `enable-remote-http-toggle` (Windows only) were enabled in Privoxy's configuration. These options allow for remote control and modification of the proxy behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Malicious websites or exit nodes could use client-side scripts (JavaScript, Java, Flash) to make requests through the proxy that bypass filtering or disable it entirely.
- An attacker can establish a direct connection from the web browser to the local proxy and modify the user's configuration settings, potentially redirecting traffic through a different malicious proxy server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious websites can use client-side scripts to interact with the local Privoxy instance.
- Malicious Tor exit nodes could inject malicious content into otherwise trusted sites to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be a malicious website operator or a malicious Tor exit node operator.
- The attacker needs the ability to inject JavaScript or other active content into a website that the victim visits.
- The attacker can also exploit vulnerabilities within a client-side web browser.
