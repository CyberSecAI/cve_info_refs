Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization/validation in the provided PHP scripts. User-supplied data from the `$_GET` array is directly embedded into SQL queries without any escaping or parameterization. This allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The scripts are vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct concatenation of user-provided input into SQL queries. Specifically, the `categorie` parameter in `catdownload.php` and `download.php`, and the `id` parameter in `hitcounter.php` are vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can manipulate the SQL queries to:
    *   Extract sensitive information from the database.
    *   Modify or delete data.
    *   Potentially gain control of the server by using advanced SQL injection techniques.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameters:** The attack vector is through the `categorie` parameter in the URLs calling `catdownload.php` and `download.php` , and the `id` parameter for `hitcounter.php` via HTTP GET requests. By modifying the value of this parameter, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable scripts.
*   **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft malicious SQL injection payloads.
*  **No Authentication:** Based on the provided information no authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Code Snippets:**
*  `catdownload.php (line 16): $sql = ('SELECT * FROM downloads WHERE categorie='.$categorie.'');`
* `download.php (line 6): mysql_query('SELECT * FROM `downloads`  WHERE categorie=' . $_GET['id']);`
* `hitcounter.php (line 15): $requete = "SELECT lien FROM downloads WHERE id=$id";`
