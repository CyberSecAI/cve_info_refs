Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2007-6085:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application, Vigile CMS 1.4, suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to insecure coding practices.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to persistent XSS through the `vedipm` and `live_chat` modules. By inserting malicious scripts in the message input, an attacker can inject client-side scripts which will be executed in the browsers of other users accessing the affected pages.
    *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application is vulnerable to LFI through the `index.php` file. The application uses user-supplied input from the `module` GET parameter to include PHP files using `include` without proper sanitization. By manipulating the `module` parameter with values such as `[somefile]%00`, an attacker can include any file on the server accessible to the webserver user, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure or remote code execution.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The application is vulnerable to CSRF when changing admin passwords. An attacker can craft a malicious HTML form that, when triggered, changes the admin password without the user's knowledge.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **XSS:** Could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.
    *   **LFI:** Could lead to information disclosure by reading sensitive files, such as configuration files or database credentials, and potentially remote code execution.
    *   **CSRF:** Could lead to unauthorized changes to the administrator's password.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **XSS:**  The attacker injects malicious scripts via the `module=vedipm` and `module=live_chat` parameters.
    *   **LFI:** The attacker manipulates the `module` parameter in the URL, like `index.php?module=[somefile]%00`.
    *   **CSRF:** The attacker lures the authenticated user to visit a malicious HTML page, triggering the password change form.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **XSS:** The attacker only needs to insert the malicious script through a vulnerable interface. No authentication needed.
    *   **LFI:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the server with a crafted module parameter.
    *   **CSRF:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into triggering the attack.

**Additional Notes:**
The content provides more details than a typical CVE description by including specific examples of how each vulnerability can be exploited.
It also provides proof-of-concept exploit code for CSRF vulnerability.
The content explicitly mentions the vulnerable modules and parameters for both XSS and LFI, and also provides the code for a proof of concept for the CSRF attack.
The content lists CVE-2007-6085 along with CVE-2007-6086 and CVE-2007-6087, but it only provides information regarding CVE-2007-6085.
