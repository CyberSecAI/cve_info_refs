- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the `index.php` file of WebPortal CMS where the `m` parameter from the GET request is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows for SQL injection by manipulating the `m` parameter.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames and passwords.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a malicious value for the `m` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker also needs to know the database table and column names in order to construct the SQL injection payload.
