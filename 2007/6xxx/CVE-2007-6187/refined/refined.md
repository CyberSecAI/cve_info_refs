- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `filepath` parameter in `css_file.php`, `js_file.php`, and `xml_file.php` located within the `/noah/modules/nosystem/templates/` directory of NoAh version 0.9 pre 1.2 is vulnerable to directory traversal. The application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input, which allows an attacker to traverse the directory structure and access arbitrary files on the server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Directory Traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`, potentially leading to information disclosure and privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable scripts (`css_file.php`, `js_file.php`, `xml_file.php`), with a manipulated `filepath` parameter containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../etc/passwd`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special privileges are required; access to the vulnerable web page is sufficient.
