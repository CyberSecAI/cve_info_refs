Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `admin_users.php` file of AuraCMS 2.2.  Specifically, the file incorrectly checks for login status.
- The `admin_users.php` file attempts to prevent direct access via the browser using a check in lines 02-06, which returns a "404 Not Found" error and exits the script if accessed directly.
- However, the file also includes a check at lines 12-15 using the `cek_login()` function. This function only verifies if a user is logged in using session cookies, regardless of their user level (user, editor, or administrator). Thus, any logged-in user can potentially access the vulnerable file.
- The vulnerability is triggered by exploiting the `index.php` file which allows arbitrary inclusion of php files. The `index.php` file does not properly sanitize user input passed via `$_GET['pilih']` and `$_GET['act']` variables, which allows an attacker to bypass the initial protection present in `admin_users.php` and include it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insufficient Access Control:** The `admin_users.php` file lacks proper access controls. While it has a check to prevent direct access, it doesn't enforce specific user roles for the administrative functions. Any logged-in user can potentially access administrative functions.
2.  **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** The `index.php` file is vulnerable to arbitrary file inclusion due to inadequate input validation on `$_GET['pilih']` and `$_GET['act']`, allowing the inclusion of files like `admin_users.php` through the `mod` parameter.
3.  **Bypass of Direct Access Check:** The intended protection against direct access of `admin_users.php` is bypassed through the arbitrary file inclusion vulnerability in `index.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker, after logging in as a regular user, can use the file inclusion vulnerability to add a new administrator account with arbitrary credentials.
- This allows the attacker to gain full administrative control of the AuraCMS system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is primarily remote.
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending HTTP POST requests to `index.php` with crafted parameters that lead to the inclusion of `admin_users.php`.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a login request to `index.php` and then sending a second request including the `admin_users.php` with parameters to create an admin user account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the AuraCMS system (any user level).
- The attacker needs to know the path to the AuraCMS installation.
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the target web server.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided exploit code is a Perl script that automates the process of logging in and creating a new admin user via the vulnerability.
- The suggested fix is to modify the `admin_users.php` file to check if `AURACMS_admin` is defined, redirecting to the index page if not. This fix, according to the exploit author, is already implemented in other admin files of AuraCMS, indicating an oversight in this file and a few others.
