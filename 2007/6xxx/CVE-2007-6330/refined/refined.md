- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Meridian Systems Prolog Manager uses weak or no encryption for passwords, and returns all user credentials to the client during authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Weak password encryption: The application does not use strong encryption by default, and the "standard" and "enhanced" encryption options are also insufficient.
    - Information disclosure: The application returns all user credentials, including passwords, to a client upon login, which is a severe information disclosure vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain user credentials and decrypt passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network traffic sniffing: Intercepting network traffic to capture user credentials during login.
    - Sending invalid login requests: Sending an invalid login request to the server to capture the response containing all user credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to intercept network traffic (e.g., by being on the same network or performing a man-in-the-middle attack).
    - Ability to send network requests to the Prolog Manager server.
    - Internal network access is explicitly mentioned as required in the vendor statement.
