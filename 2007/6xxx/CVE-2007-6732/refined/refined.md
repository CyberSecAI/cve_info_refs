{
  "vulnerability_1": {
    "root_cause": "A] buffer-overflow in test_oxm / decrunch_oxm",
    "weaknesses": "The functions handling the OXM file format are vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The check `ilen > 263` can be bypassed by setting `ilen` to a negative value, allowing an attacker to overflow the `buf` buffer.",
    "impact": "Executing malicious code by overflowing the `buf` buffer.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a crafted OXM file with a negative `ilen` value.",
   "required_capabilities": "Ability to supply a specially crafted .oxm file to the application. Local access to the application."
  },
  "vulnerability_2": {
     "root_cause": "B] buffer-overflow in dtt_load",
     "weaknesses": "The `pofs` and `plen` arrays can be overflowed with arbitrary data in the `dtt_load()` function.",
     "impact": "Arbitrary data can overflow the arrays, potentially leading to code execution. Details on impact are limited within this report.",
     "attack_vectors": "By providing a crafted DTT file that causes `m->xxh->pat` to have a large value that allows the loop to read data beyond the `pofs` and `plen` arrays.",
     "required_capabilities":"Ability to supply a specially crafted .dtt file to the application. Local access to the application."
