Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-6179:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to multiple Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaws in Charrays CMS version 0.9.3. The `ccms_library_path` parameter in `markdown.php` and `gallery.php` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The application allows an attacker to include and execute remote files by manipulating the `ccms_library_path` parameter. This is due to insufficient sanitization or validation of user-supplied input.
- Lack of input sanitization: The vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that `register_globals` is enabled, which is generally discouraged and dangerous.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system.
- Data Breach: An attacker could gain access to sensitive data, modify or delete data, or use the server to launch attacks against other systems.
- Website Defacement: The attacker could modify the content of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable PHP scripts (`markdown.php`, `gallery.php`), supplying a malicious URL as the value for the `ccms_library_path` parameter.
-  `http://[site]/[path]/decoder/markdown.php?ccms_library_path=[Evil_Code]`
-  `http://[site]/[path]/decoder/gallery.php?ccms_library_path=[Evil_Code]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- Knowledge of the target path: The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable scripts (`markdown.php`, `gallery.php`) within the Charrays CMS installation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit was tested against Charrays CMS 0.9.3.
- The exploit relies on the PHP configuration having `register_globals = On`, which is a deprecated and insecure configuration.
- The exploit code provided on exploit-db demonstrates how to use the vulnerable parameter to inject remote code.
