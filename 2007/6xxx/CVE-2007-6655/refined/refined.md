- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `root_path` variable is not properly sanitized before being used in an `include_once` statement, leading to remote file inclusion. Specifically, the code uses `$datei_path = $datei_path ? $datei_path : $root_path."/index.php";` where `$datei_path` is set based on the provided `$root_path` parameter,  and then uses `include_once($root_path.'/includes/config.php');` which allows an attacker to control the path of included file via `root_path` variable.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, allowing them to execute malicious code on the server, leading to complete compromise of the system.

- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to `/includes/function.php` with the `root_path` parameter set to the URL of a malicious file. 

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server and needs to host a malicious file accessible by the server.
