1) Introduction
===============
Feng is an open source RTSP/RTP streaming server written by the italian
team of the Politecnico di Torino University for the LScube project.
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
---------------------------------------------------
A] first buffer-overflow in RTSP\_valid\_response\_msg
---------------------------------------------------
A buffer-overflow vulnerability is exploitable through a stack buffer
of 15 bytes called trash used as destination by sscanf without the
needed size limits.
From rtsp/RTSP\_state\_machine.c:
int RTSP\_valid\_response\_msg(unsigned short \*status, char \*msg, RTSP\_buffer \* rtsp)
// This routine is from BP.
{
char ver[32], trash[15];
unsigned int stat;
unsigned int seq;
int pcnt; /\* parameter count \*/
\*ver = \*msg = '\0';
/\* assuming "stat" may not be zero (probably faulty) \*/
stat = 0;
pcnt =
sscanf(rtsp->in\_buffer, " %31s %u %s %s %u\n%255s ", ver, &stat,
trash, trash, &seq, msg);
...
----------------------------------------------------
B] second buffer-overflow in RTSP\_valid\_response\_msg
----------------------------------------------------
A buffer-overflow vulnerability is exploitable through a stack buffer
of 100 bytes called msg used as destination by sscanf limited to 255
bytes in the function RTSP\_valid\_response\_msg.
From rtsp/RTSP\_state\_machine.c:
int RTSP\_handler(RTSP\_buffer \* rtsp)
{
unsigned short status;
char msg[100];
...
op = RTSP\_valid\_response\_msg(&status, msg, rtsp);
...
int RTSP\_valid\_response\_msg(unsigned short \*status, char \*msg, RTSP\_buffer \* rtsp)
...
sscanf(rtsp->in\_buffer, " %31s %u %s %s %u\n%255s ", ver, &stat,
trash, trash, &seq, msg);
...
---------------------------
C] crash in RTSP\_remove\_msg
---------------------------
An integer overflow is exploitable through the RTP packets.
Using a 16 bit size value of 0xffff is possible to force the server to
move 4294967293 bytes in the destination buffer:
RTSP\_BUFFERSIZE = 65536
len = 65539 (4 of hdrlen + 0xffff)
result = -3
From rtsp/RTSP\_lowlevel.c:
void RTSP\_remove\_msg(int len, RTSP\_buffer \* rtsp)
{
rtsp->in\_size -= len;
if (rtsp->in\_size && len) { /\* discard the message from the in\_buffer. \*/
memmove(rtsp->in\_buffer, &(rtsp->in\_buffer[len]),
RTSP\_BUFFERSIZE - len);
memset(&(rtsp->in\_buffer[len]), 0, RTSP\_BUFFERSIZE - len);
}
}
-----------------------------------------
D] NULL pointer in parse\_transport\_header
-----------------------------------------
From rtsp/RTSP\_setup.c:
static RTSP\_Error parse\_transport\_header(RTSP\_buffer \* rtsp,
...
p = strstr(p, "=");
sscanf(p + 1, "%d", &(cli\_ports.RTP));
p = strstr(p, "-");
sscanf(p + 1, "%d", &(cli\_ports.RTCP));
...
p = strstr(p, "=");
sscanf(p + 1, "%d", &rtp\_ch);
...
p = strstr(p, "=");
sscanf(p + 1, "%d", &rtp\_ch);
...
----------------------------------------
E] NULL pointer in parse\_play\_time\_range
----------------------------------------
From rtsp/RTSP\_Play:
static RTSP\_Error parse\_play\_time\_range(RTSP\_buffer \* rtsp, play\_args \* args)
...
q = strchr(q, '=');
if (get\_utc(&(args->playback\_time), q + 1) != ERR\_NOERROR) {
...
---------------------------------
F] NULL pointer in log\_user\_agent
---------------------------------
The log\_user\_agent function uses an unchecked strstr for finding the
end of the User-Agent value (a line field), but the server can handle
also carriage-return chars allowing an attacker to crash it using only
0x0d chars in his request.
From rtsp/RTSP\_utils.c:
void log\_user\_agent(RTSP\_buffer \* rtsp)
{
char \* p;
if ((p = strstr(rtsp->in\_buffer, HDR\_USER\_AGENT)) != NULL) {
char cut[strlen(p)];
strcpy(cut, p);
p = strstr(cut, "\n");
cut[strlen(cut) - strlen(p) - 1] = '\0';
...
----------------------------------
G] NULL pointer in Netembryo 0.0.4
----------------------------------
Although this vulnerability affects another software of the LScube
project I have preferred to include it here since only when used with
Feng this bug can be considered a security bug (Netembryo in fact is
used also in libnemesi which is a client-side library).
The usage of the ':' char after the backslash allows an attacker to
crash the server on which is used the Url\_init() function of the
Netembryo library.
In short when an urlname like /: is used the port\_begin and path\_begin
pointers will point to the same location bypassing the check
"port\_begin > path\_begin", then the function will try to allocate
4294967294 bytes (-2 resulted by (size\_t)(path\_begin - port\_begin - 1))
for url->port which will fail and so the resulted NULL pointer will be
used as destination in the subsequent strncpy.
From utils/url.c:
int Url\_init(Url \* url, char \* urlname)
{
...
path\_begin = strstr(hostname\_begin, "/");
if (path\_begin == NULL) {
path\_len = 0;
}
else {
++path\_begin;
...
port\_begin = strstr(hostname\_begin, ":");
if ((port\_begin == NULL) || ((port\_begin > path\_begin) && (path\_begin != NULL))) {
...
if (port\_len) {
url->port = (char\*)malloc(port\_len+1);
strncpy(url->port, port\_begin, port\_len);
url->port[port\_len] = '\0';
}

---------------------------------------------------
A] first buffer-overflow in RTSP\_valid\_response\_msg
---------------------------------------------------
A buffer-overflow vulnerability is exploitable through a stack buffer
of 15 bytes called trash used as destination by sscanf without the
needed size limits.
From rtsp/RTSP\_state\_machine.c:
int RTSP\_valid\_response\_msg(unsigned short \*status, char \*msg, RTSP\_buffer \* rtsp)
// This routine is from BP.
{
char ver[32], trash[15];

int pcnt; /\* parameter count \*/
\*ver = \*msg = '\0';
/\* assuming "stat" may not be zero (probably faulty) \*/
stat = 0;
pcnt =
sscanf(rtsp->in\_buffer, " %31s %u %s %s %u\n%255s ", ver, &stat,
trash, trash, &seq, msg);
...
----------------------------------------------------
B] second buffer-overflow in RTSP\_valid\_response\_msg
----------------------------------------------------
A buffer-overflow vulnerability is exploitable through a stack buffer
of 100 bytes called msg used as destination by sscanf limited to 255
bytes in the function RTSP\_valid\_response\_msg.
From rtsp/RTSP\_state\_machine.c:
int RTSP\_handler(RTSP\_buffer \* rtsp)
{
unsigned short status;
char msg[100];
...
op = RTSP\_valid\_response\_msg(&status, msg, rtsp);
...
int RTSP\_valid\_response\_msg(unsigned short \*status, char \*msg, RTSP\_buffer \* rtsp)
...
sscanf(rtsp->in\_buffer, " %31s %u %s %s %u\n%255s ", ver, &stat,
trash, trash, &seq, msg);
...
---------------------------
C] crash in RTSP\_remove\_msg
---------------------------
An integer overflow is exploitable through the RTP packets.
Using a 16 bit size value of 0xffff is possible to force the server to
move 4294967293 bytes in the destination buffer:
RTSP\_BUFFERSIZE = 65536
len = 65539 (4 of hdrlen + 0xffff)
result = -3
From rtsp/RTSP\_lowlevel.c:
void RTSP\_remove\_msg(int len, RTSP\_buffer \* rtsp)
{
rtsp->in\_size -= len;
if (rtsp->in\_size && len) { /\* discard the message from the in\_buffer. \*/
memmove(rtsp->in\_buffer, &(rtsp->in\_buffer[len]),
RTSP\_BUFFERSIZE - len);
memset(&(rtsp->in\_buffer[len]), 0, RTSP\_BUFFERSIZE - len);
}
}
-----------------------------------------
D] NULL pointer in parse\_transport\_header
-----------------------------------------
From rtsp/RTSP\_setup.c:
static RTSP\_Error parse\_transport\_header(RTSP\_buffer \* rtsp,
...
p = strstr(p, "=");
sscanf(p + 1, "%d", &(cli\_ports.RTP));
p = strstr(p, "-");
sscanf(p + 1, "%d", &(cli\_ports.RTCP));
...
p = strstr(p, "=");
sscanf(p + 1, "%d", &rtp\_ch);
...
p = strstr(p, "=");
sscanf(p + 1, "%d", &rtp\_ch);
...
----------------------------------------
E] NULL pointer in parse\_play\_time\_range
----------------------------------------
From rtsp/RTSP\_Play:
static RTSP\_Error parse\_play\_time\_range(RTSP\_buffer \* rtsp, play\_args \* args)
...
q = strchr(q, '=');
if (get\_utc(&(args->playback\_time), q + 1) != ERR\_NOERROR) {
...
---------------------------------
F] NULL pointer in log\_user\_agent
---------------------------------
The log\_user\_agent function uses an unchecked strstr for finding the
end of the User-Agent value (a line field), but the server can handle
also carriage-return chars allowing an attacker to crash it using only
0x0d chars in his request.
From rtsp/RTSP\_utils.c:
void log\_user\_agent(RTSP\_buffer \* rtsp)
{
char \* p;
if ((p = strstr(rtsp->in\_buffer, HDR\_USER\_AGENT)) != NULL) {
char cut[strlen(p)];
strcpy(cut, p);
p = strstr(cut, "\n");
cut[strlen(cut) - strlen(p) - 1] = '\0';

----------------------------------
G] NULL pointer in Netembryo 0.0.4
----------------------------------
Although this vulnerability affects another software of the LScube
project I have preferred to include it here since only when used with
Feng this bug can be considered a security bug (Netembryo in fact is
used also in libnemesi which is a client-side library).
The usage of the ':' char after the backslash allows an attacker to
crash the server on which is used the Url\_init() function of the
Netembryo library.
In short when an urlname like /: is used the port\_begin and path\_begin
pointers will point to the same location bypassing the check
"port\_begin > path\_begin", then the function will try to allocate
4294967294 bytes (-2 resulted by (size\_t)(path\_begin - port\_begin - 1))
for url->port which will fail and so the resulted NULL pointer will be
used as destination in the subsequent strncpy.
From utils/url.c:
int Url\_init(Url \* url, char \* urlname)
{
...
path\_begin = strstr(hostname\_begin, "/");
if (path\_begin == NULL) {
path\_len = 0;
}
else {
++path\_begin;
...
port\_begin = strstr(hostname\_begin, ":");
if ((port\_begin == NULL) || ((port\_begin > path\_begin) && (path\_begin != NULL))) {
...
if (port\_len) {
url->port = (char\*)malloc(port\_len+1);
strncpy(url->port, port\_begin, port\_len);
url->port[port\_len] = '\0';
}
