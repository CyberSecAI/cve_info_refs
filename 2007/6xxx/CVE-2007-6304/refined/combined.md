# MySQL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200804-04**

Multiple vulnerabilities in MySQL might lead to privilege escalation and
Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/mysql** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.0.54** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.0.54** |

### Background

MySQL is a popular multi-threaded, multi-user SQL server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in MySQL:

* Mattias Jonsson reported that a "RENAME TABLE" command against a
  table with explicit "DATA DIRECTORY" and "INDEX DIRECTORY" options
  would overwrite the file to which the symlink points
  (CVE-2007-5969).
* Martin Friebe discovered that MySQL does not
  update the DEFINER value of a view when the view is altered
  (CVE-2007-6303).
* Philip Stoev discovered that the federated
  engine expects the response of a remote MySQL server to contain a
  minimum number of columns in query replies (CVE-2007-6304).

### Impact

An authenticated remote attacker could exploit the first vulnerability
to overwrite MySQL system tables and escalate privileges, or use the
second vulnerability to gain privileges via an "ALTER VIEW" statement.
Remote federated MySQL servers could cause a Denial of Service in the
local MySQL server by exploiting the third vulnerability.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MySQL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/mysql-5.0.54"
```

Package        : mysql-dfsg-5.0
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-3781 CVE-2007-5969 CVE-2007-6304

Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MySQL
database server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-3781

    It was discovered that privilege validation for the source table
    of CREATE TABLE LIKE statements was insufficiently enforced, which
    might lead to information disclosure. This is only exploitable by
    authenticated users.

CVE-2007-5969

    It was discovered that symbolic links were handled insecurely during
    the creation of tables with DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY
    statements, which might lead to denial of service by overwriting
    data. This is only exploitable by authenticated users.

CVE-2007-6304

    It was discovered that queries to data in a FEDERATED table can
    lead to a crash of the local database server, if the remote server
    returns information with less columns than expected, resulting in
    denial of service.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.51-1.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.32-7etch4.

The the old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain mysql-dfsg-5.0.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- SUN Java 1.5 and 1.6 update
SUN Java 1.5.0 was brought to update14 and SUN Java 1.6.0 was
brought to update4. Details for the security issues fixed are not
yet publicly known, but the changelog lists several issues marked
as security.
The update also contains timezone update 2007k and was released
for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- nss\_ldap incorrect data
nss\_ldap returned incorrect data under certain circumstances to
the calling process. Some applications could therefore work with
wrong user data (CVE-2007-5794).
This has been fixed for all distributions containing nss\_ldap.
- cairo integer overflows in PNG decoder
The cairo libraries were updated to fix several integer overflows
while decoding PNG images. This can be exploited remotely with
user-assistance to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2007-5503)
Updates have been provided for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE Linux
10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3
- geronimo start script problems
A chown in the SUSE supplied Apache geronimo init script could
change ownership of directories it did not own, due to following
symlinks. The default setup would corrupt /var/tmp on start
of geronimo.
While there is potential to exploit this problem,
the administrator will have likely noticed this before already.
- moodle XSS problems
The install script of moodle is vulnerable to cross site scripting
(XSS). This flaw is only exploitable if moodle isn't fully installed
yet. Therefore it's unlikely to be much of a problem in practice. To
actually exploit it an attacker would have to know about a person
that is just about to install moodle (CVE-2008-0123).
- SDL\_image GIF problems
Specially crafted GIF files could crash the SDL\_image library
(CVE-2006-4484).
Updates have been released for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2
and 10.3.
- python imageop integer overflow
Specially crafted images could trigger an integer overflow in the
imageop module of python (CVE-2007-4965).

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Description:
The federated engine will issue

SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'table'

against the remote server in order to retrieve row count and other items.

The issue is that the federated handler expects that the response to this query will have at least 14 columns. A malicious server may send a response that contains less than 14 columns, at which point the federated handler will crash, bringing down the entire server with it.

How to repeat:
line 2733 of ha_federated.cc shows row[4] being accessed without making sure that the response has 4 or more columns. Same applies for the next few lines of code.

A simple code inspection will reveal the issue, however a demo script is available that indeed crashes the server and produces the stack trace below:

Stack range sanity check OK, backtrace follows:

New value of fp=(nil) failed sanity check, terminating stack trace!

Suggested fix:
always use mysql_num_fields() to determine if the query returned the desired number of columns.

Thank you for the report.

Please provide example from real life when server can "send a response that contains less than 14 columns".

  [bug #29801](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=29801) Federated engine crashes local server
                 if remote server sends malicious response.

  We need to check if the SHOW TABLE STATUS query we issue inside the
  FEDERATED engine returned the result with the proper (or just sufficient)
  number of rows. Otherwise statements like row[12] can crash the server.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
