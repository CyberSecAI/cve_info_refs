{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to local file inclusion due to insufficient sanitization of the 'id' parameter in the 'show_content.php' script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the vulnerable script.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the 'show_content.php' script with a manipulated 'id' parameter.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is needed for exploitation."
