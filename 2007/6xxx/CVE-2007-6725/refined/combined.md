Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2008-5699
2008-07-01 02:46:21
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
```

Name        : ghostscript
Product     : Fedora 9
Version     : 8.62
Release     : 4.fc9
URL         : <http://www.ghostscript.com/>
Summary     : A PostScript(TM) interpreter and renderer.
Description :
Ghostscript is a set of software that provides a PostScript(TM)
interpreter, a set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library, which
implements the graphics capabilities in the PostScript language) and
an interpreter for Portable Document Format (PDF) files. Ghostscript
translates PostScript code into many common, bitmapped formats, like
those understood by your printer or screen. Ghostscript is normally
used to display PostScript files and to print PostScript files to
non-PostScript printers.

If you need to display PostScript files or print them to
non-PostScript printers, you should install ghostscript. If you
install ghostscript, you also need to install the ghostscript-fonts
package.

Also, AdobeReader is showing an empty page. I agree that a crash is always a software bug the document seems to be horribly wrong to begin with. Is this a kind of document you will consistenly produce?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=229174#c4)  Need Real Name    2007-02-20 17:49:33 UTC  ``` This document is one page from a historic book I bought in electronic format.  It is quite possible that this specific file has invalid .pdf, other pages are OK. evince shows me half page, then just blanks and give warnings about invalid pdf.  The importance of this bug is the security of ghostscript itself. Usually similar crashes indicate possible buffer overflow  or similar high risk security vulnerability. Because ghostscript is widely used for printing untrusted .pdf and .ps this is important for security reason.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=229174#c5)  Jan Hutař    2007-10-29 20:54:16 UTC  ``` I can see this in F8 (ghostscript-8.60-5.fc8) too.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=229174#c8)  Tim Waugh    2008-01-14 12:24:32 UTC  ``` Still happens with Fedora 8 (ghostscript-8.61-5.fc8).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=229174#c9)  petrosyan    2008-02-18 03:09:59 UTC  ``` this bug is still present in ghostscript-8.61-6.fc8   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=229174#c10)  Tim Waugh    2008-06-23 13:42:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 310029](attachment.cgi?id=310029&action=diff "gs-scfd.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=310029&action=edit "gs-scfd.patch") gs-scfd.patch  Seems to be a buffer underrun in cf_decode_2d(), src/scfd.c:693 (the invert_data call).

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- IBMJava5-JRE/java-1\_5\_0-ibm
The update brings IBM Java 5 to SR9-SSU.
It fixes a lot of security issues:
CVE-2009-1100: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with storing temporary font files may allow an untrusted applet or
application to consume a disproportionate amount of disk space resulting
in a denial-of-service condition.
CVE-2009-1100: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with processing temporary font files may allow an untrusted applet or
application to retain temporary files resulting in a denial-of-service
condition.
CVE-2009-1103: A vulnerability in the Java Plug-in with deserializing
applets may allow an untrusted applet to escalate privileges. For
example, an untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and
write local files or execute local applications that are accessible to
the user running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1104: The Java Plug-in allows Javascript code that is loaded
from the localhost to connect to any port on the system. This may be
leveraged together with XSS vulnerabilities in a blended attack to
access other applications listening on ports other than the one where
the Javascript code was served from.
CVE-2009-1093: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) with
initializing LDAP connections may be exploited by a remote client to
cause a denial-of-service condition on the LDAP service.
CVE-2009-1094: A vulnerability in Java Runtime Environment LDAP client
implementation may allow malicious data from an LDAP server to cause
malicious code to be unexpectedly loaded and executed on an LDAP client.
CVE-2009-1107: The Java Plugin displays a warning dialog for signed
applets. A signed applet can obscure the contents of the dialog and trick
a user into trusting the applet.
CVE-2009-1095
CVE-2009-1096: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with unpacking applets and Java Web Start applications
using the unpack200 JAR unpacking utility may allow an untrusted applet
or application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted applet
may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running the untrusted
applet.
CVE-2009-1098: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing GIF images may allow an untrusted applet or
Java Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an
untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local
files or execute local applications that are accessible to the user
running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1099: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing fonts may allow an untrusted applet or Java
Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or
execute local applications that are accessible to the user running the
untrusted applet.
Affected products: SLES9, SLE10
- RealPlayer
RealPlayer 10 is vulnerable to a critical security problem in the flash
plugin (CVE-2007-5400). Real does not provide updated binaries of
RealPlayer 10 and SUSE is not allowed to ship RealPlayer 11. Therefore
this update disables the flash plugin by setting restrictive file system
permissions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

## Synopsis

Moderate: ghostscript security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A0420)

## Topic

Updated ghostscript packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Ghostscript is a set of software that provides a PostScript interpreter, a
set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library, which implements the graphics
capabilities in the PostScript language) and an interpreter for Portable
Document Format (PDF) files.

It was discovered that the Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2009:0345 did not
address all possible integer overflow flaws in Ghostscript's International
Color Consortium Format library (icclib). Using specially-crafted ICC
profiles, an attacker could create a malicious PostScript or PDF file with
embedded images that could cause Ghostscript to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-0792)

A missing boundary check was found in Ghostscript's CCITTFax decoding
filter. An attacker could create a specially-crafted PostScript or PDF file
that could cause Ghostscript to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code when opened. (CVE-2007-6725)

Users of ghostscript are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

ghostscript security update (RHSA-2009-0420)

Original Release Date: April 28, 2009

Last Revised: April 28, 2009

Number: ASA-2009-155

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Ghostscript is a set of software that provides a PostScript interpreter, a
set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library, which implements the graphics
capabilities in the PostScript language) and an interpreter for Portable
Document Format (PDF) files.

It was discovered that the Red Hat Security Advisory
[RHSA-2009-0345](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0345.html)
did not address all possible integer overflow flaws in Ghostscript's International
Color Consortium Format library (icclib). Using specially-crafted ICC
profiles, an attacker could create a malicious PostScript or PDF file with
embedded images that could cause Ghostscript to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code when opened.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-0792](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0792) to this issue.

A missing boundary check was found in Ghostscript's CCITTFax decoding
filter. An attacker could create a specially-crafted PostScript or PDF file
that could cause Ghostscript to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code when opened.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2007-6725](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6725) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0420.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with ghostscript installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Message Storage Server | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Proactive Contact | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |
| AES 4.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.
