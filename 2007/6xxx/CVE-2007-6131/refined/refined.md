Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-6131:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `buttonpressed.sh` script in `scanbuttond` uses hardcoded temporary file paths (`/tmp/scan.pnm` and `/tmp/scan.jpg`).
- The script does not use `mktemp` or any method to generate unique, non-predictable temporary filenames.
- There is no attempt to remove or check existing files before writing to the hardcoded temporary file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** The use of predictable temporary file names in `/tmp` allows for a symlink attack.
- **Race Condition:**  An attacker could create a symlink at `/tmp/scan.pnm` or `/tmp/scan.jpg` to an arbitrary file on the system before the `scanbuttond` script attempts to write to it.
- **Lack of Cleanup:** The script does not properly trap signals to ensure temporary files are removed upon abnormal exit, leading to potential leftovers.
- **Privilege Mismanagement:** The script runs as root, exacerbating the impact of the file overwrite vulnerability. There's an issue with the script running as root which is not necessary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite any file on the system that the root user has write access to by creating a symlink to the target file before the script creates the temporary files.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** By overwriting critical system files, an attacker could potentially escalate privileges or compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs local access to the system to create the malicious symlinks.
- **Symlink Attack:** The core attack vector is exploiting the insecure usage of temporary files via symlinks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
- **File System Access:** Ability to create files and symlinks in `/tmp` directory before the vulnerable script is executed.

**Additional Details:**

* The bug report mentions that `scanbuttond` is started as a system service and runs as root. This configuration makes the temporary file vulnerability more critical.
* The report highlights that `editcmd()` function in the script is also problematic as it tries to use GUI applications like `gimp` or send emails with attachments as root.
* The proposed solution includes using `mktemp`, ensuring temporary files are handled correctly, and considering running the service as a user rather than root.
* The report also suggests using `xdg-open` or `xdg-email` to open files or send emails instead of hardcoded paths to specific applications.

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description, which simply mentions "allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack".
