| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=383131#c0)  Michal Jaegermann    2007-11-14 19:22:44 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  scanbuttond, as packaged, runs as a root owned process.  Despite of that in /etc/scanbuttond/buttonpressed.sh one can find  TMPFILE="/tmp/scan.pnm" TMPJPGFILE="/tmp/scan.jpg"  Not even a need to race to guess those file names and that script, executed by scanbuttond, writes there.  Security implications are obvious and 'mktemp' exists for a reason.  As things stand now there is not even a feeble attempt to remove possibly existing files/links before trying to write to those.  Moreover 'cleanup' function is not trapped which means that there will be leftovers on an abnormal exit.  At least something of that sort should be present  trap 'cleanup; exit'  TERM INT QUIT KILL EXIT  before any of temporaries are created.  On the top of all the above it is highly doubtful that this script should be run by root as one of system services.  Do you really want to try to run on a root behalf things like editcmd() {     gimp $TMPFILE } or send some email with attachments?   I guess that one of simple possible solutions would be to add a startup file in /etc/profile.d/ which would check for a presence of $DISPLAY (does not seem to much point of running that otherwise in general - at least without writing quite a different script) and that other instance of scanbuttond is not already running and launch that for a user.  Other possibilty which comes to mind is to register a startup as one of seesions scripts.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): scanbuttond-0.2.3-10.fc7   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=383131#c1)  Parag AN(पराग)    2007-11-22 09:49:05 UTC  ``` thanks for your feedback and questions. Actually I don't have any scanner now with me. For some work I was needed this package in Fedora so I added it. Then I got some other work and lost my interest in this package as I also not got any kind of feedback for this package from anyone.  But good to see your feedback. Will work on that.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=383131#c2)  Michal Jaegermann    2007-11-23 05:28:54 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 267351](attachment.cgi?id=267351&action=diff "the most pressing security fixes") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=267351&action=edit "the most pressing security fixes") the most pressing security fixes  The most urgent security horrors should be taken care by the following trivial patch.	Before that patch you can overwrite with this script any file on a system.  Nice!  This is not doing anything for that detail that scripts here are running with a wrong owner as 'root' is surely not that.  Also instead of hardwiring names of some programs, say for a particular mail user agent, facilities like xdg-open or xdg-email should be used instead.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=383131#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2007-11-23 20:19:38 UTC  ``` Wow, this sounds scary...  I do not have scanner to play with to verify these issues.  Parag, Michal, can scanbuttond be run under unprivileged user and still work correctly (asking mainly with respect to device files permissions)?  Have you verified whether apps like gimp or thunderbird can really be started from scanbuttond?  I suspect that may be prevented by unset DISPLAY for example.  However, starting those apps under root user and allowing unprivileged user to control them has also significant security impact.    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=383131#c4)  Michal Jaegermann    2007-11-23 23:02:41 UTC  ``` > Parag, Michal, can > scanbuttond be run under unprivileged user and still work correctly  Well, I do not have a scanner of that type either.  I looked at scanbuttond as a workaround for bugs in USB support which made a scanner of a friend to "warm up" all the time.  It mostly worked in that role.  That friend does not care about buttons.  Try <http://www.google.com/linux?hl=en&q=%22scanner+warming+up%22+snapscan&btnG=Search&meta>= for some problem samples. Also [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/85488](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-source-2.6.20/%2Bbug/85488)  Actually scanbuttond to service buttons _has to_ run with an id of a console owner (the same way as xsane does).  You definitely do not want for root to edit your pictures (after all an ownership will be wrong) or send your mail. Using root too feed something from a scanner to your printer also does not sound like a good proposition.  With a correct configuration a scanner device is read-write for a console owner so this is not a problem.  As a session program scanbuttond should work, although I have no idea how to make a package to register it that way or how to deal with KDE.  You cannot use the current /etc/rc.d/init.d/scanbuttond to start it that way, though, as this tries to write to /var/lock/subsys/scanbuttond and that is priviledged.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=383131#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2007-11-27 11:44:27 UTC  ``` This issue was assigned CVE id [CVE-2007-6131](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-6131).  buttonpressed.sh in scanbuttond 0.2.3 allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the (1) scan.pnm and (2) scan.jpg temporary files.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=383131#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2007-11-27 17:01:01 UTC  ``` After some more test it seems that problem with gimp or thunderbird started under root is prevented by unset DISPLAY, if scanbuttond is started during system boot-up.  (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=383131#c4)) > As a session program scanbuttond should work, although I have no > idea how to make a package to register it that way or how to deal > with KDE.  You cannot use the current /etc/rc.d/init.d/scanbuttond > to start it that way, though, as this tries to write to > /var/lock/subsys/scanbuttond and that is priviledged.  I'm not sure what is the best and desktop environment / window manager independent way of starting it as a session program.  Adding script to /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/ may be one of the options.  It should also be investigated how to correctly deal with multiple X sessions / fast user switching.     ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=383131#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2007-11-28 09:48:51 UTC  ``` Using /etc/xdg/autostart/ and ~/.config/autostart/ should probably be considered:  <http://standards.freedesktop.org/autostart-spec/autostart-spec-0.5.html>  (Not sure how it's supported in non-KDE and non-GNOME window managers.)    ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=383131#c8)  Parag AN(पराग)    2007-12-17 04:50:42 UTC  ``` as I don't have scanner now and not getting time to work on this issue I will be happy to see any one co-maintaining this package and will be happy him to fix this issue.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=383131#c9)  Bug Zapper    2008-05-14 15:03:33 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 7 is nearing the end of life. Approximately 30 (thirty) days from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 7. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as WONTFIX if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '7'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version prior to Fedora 7's end of life.  Bug Reporter: Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we may not be able to fix it before Fedora 7 is end of life. If you would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version of Fedora please change the 'version' of this bug. If you are unable to change the version, please add a comment here and someone will do it for you.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes bugs or makes them obsolete. If possible, it is recommended that you try the newest available Fedora distribution to see if your bug still exists.  Please read the Release Notes for the newest Fedora distribution to make sure it will meet your needs: <http://docs.fedoraproject.org/release-notes/>  The process we are following is described here: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers/HouseKeeping>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=383131#c10)  Michal Jaegermann    2008-05-14 15:43:07 UTC  ``` > This message is a reminder that Fedora 7 is nearing the end of life.  I see the same  TMPFILE="/tmp/scan.pnm" TMPJPGFILE="/tmp/scan.jpg"  in scanbuttond-0.2.3-12.fc9 with a "Build Date: Sat 09 Feb 2008 09:00:08 AM MST". Should a "Product" tag on this report be changed to "Security Response"?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=383131#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2008-05-16 17:57:00 UTC  ``` Moving to Security Response to prevent further harm from BugZappers.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=383131#c12)  Parag AN(पराग)    2010-01-28 06:13:14 UTC  ``` Retired this package from Fedora rawhide/13 now. Sorry to say but I have no time to test changes needed here.   ``` |  |
