Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input sanitization in `faq.php` and `member.php`. Specifically, the `id` parameter in `faq.php` and the `member` parameter in `member.php` are directly used in SQL queries without any validation or escaping, making them vulnerable to SQL injection.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, arising from unsanitized user-supplied input being directly incorporated into SQL queries.

* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Database Access:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data in the database.
    *   **Credential Theft:** As demonstrated in the provided Proof of Concept (PoC) examples, an attacker could extract user credentials (username and password) from the `member` table.
    *   **Full Server Compromise:** In severe cases, the attacker could potentially use SQL injection as a stepping stone to a full server compromise if the database user has sufficient privileges.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests to `faq.php` and `member.php`, exploiting the `id` and `member` parameters respectively.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    *   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have some familiarity with SQL syntax to craft malicious queries.
    *   **Target Specific Knowledge**:  The attacker needs to know or guess the database table prefix to successfully carry out the attack. The PoC mentions the prefix is commonly `nb`.
