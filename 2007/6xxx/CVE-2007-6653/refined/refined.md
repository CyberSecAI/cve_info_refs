- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `download.php` script in Mihalism Multi Host v2.0.7 is vulnerable to a remote file disclosure vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability, allowing access to arbitrary files on the server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information like system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) and configuration files.
- **Attack vectors:**  A remote attacker sends a crafted GET request to `download.php` with a `file` parameter containing a path traversal sequence (e.g., `../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and does not need any authentication. They only require access to the vulnerable web application.
