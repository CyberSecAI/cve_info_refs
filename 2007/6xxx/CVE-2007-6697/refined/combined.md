[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [sdl-image1.2](/security/cves?package=sdl-image1.2) -

## Details

Michael Skladnikiewicz discovered that SDL\_image did not correctly load

GIF images. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing

a specially crafted GIF, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code

or cause a crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-6697](/security/CVE-2007-6697))

David Raulo discovered that SDL\_image did not correctly load ILBM images.

If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially

crafted ILBM, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause

a crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-0544](/security/CVE-2008-0544))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1493-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
February 10, 2008                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : sdl-image1.2
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-6697 CVE-2008-0554

Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the image
loading library for the Simple DirectMedia Layer 1.2. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-6697

    Gynvael Coldwind discovered a buffer overflow in GIF image parsing,
    which could result in denial of service and potentially the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-0544

    It was discovered that a buffer overflow in IFF ILBM image parsing
    could result in denial of service and potentially the execution of
    arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.5-2etch1.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.4-1etch1. Due to a copy & paste error etch1 was appended
to the version number instead of "sarge1". Since the update is otherwise
technically correct, the update was not rebuild to the buildd network.

We recommend that you upgrade your sdl-image1.2 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

- ----------------------

Oldstable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

# SDL\_image: Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities — GLSA **200802-01**

Two boundary errors have been identified in SDL\_image allowing for the
remote execution of arbitrary code or the crash of the application using
the library.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/sdl-image** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.6-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.6-r1** |

### Background

SDL\_image is an image file library that loads images as SDL surfaces,
and supports various formats like BMP, GIF, JPEG, LBM, PCX, PNG, PNM,
TGA, TIFF, XCF, XPM, and XV.

### Description

The LWZReadByte() function in file IMG\_gif.c and the IMG\_LoadLBM\_RW()
function in file IMG\_lbm.c each contain a boundary error that can be
triggered to cause a static buffer overflow and a heap-based buffer
overflow. The first boundary error comes from some old vulnerable GD
PHP code (CVE-2006-4484).

### Impact

A remote attacker can make an application using the SDL\_image library
to process a specially crafted GIF file or IFF ILBM file that will
trigger a buffer overflow, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code
with the permissions of the application or the application crash.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All SDL\_image users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/sdl-image-1.2.6-r1"
```

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

PowerPC CPUs can operate in two modes: *big-endian* and *little-endian*.

* The **ppc** and **ppc64** stages are *big-endian* stages and can be used with *any PowerPC* CPU, including some old Apple™ hardware.
* The **ppc64le** stages are *little-endian* stages and are created for running on *POWER8 and newer* CPUs.
* The **power9le** stages are *little-endian* stages optimized exclusively for *POWER9* CPUs.

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

The vulnerabilities are reported in version 1.2.6. Prior versions may also be affected.  Solution: Fixed in SVN repository. <http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/viewvc.cgi/...L_image/IMG_gif.c?r1=2970&r2=3462> <http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/viewvc.cgi/...L_image/IMG_lbm.c?r1=3341&r2=3521>  Provided and/or discovered by: 1) The vendor credits Michael Skladnikiewicz.

Security Advisory
Name:SDL\_Image 1.2.6 and prior GIF handling buffer overflow
Type:(Remote) DoS / Code Execution (?)
Impact:Low / Medium (?)
Credits:[**gynvael.coldwind**](?team&who=gyn)

Discovered:2007-12-17
Published:2008-01-23

### Brief

SDL\_Image is an open source library providing image file handling
functionality.
GIF format handling routines suffers from lack of proper buffer
size validating, which makes it vulnerable to a buffer overflow
attack. An attacker could DoS an application using SDL\_Image,
or execute arbitrary code (this has not been confirmed, and
is believed to be nontrivial).
Since this is a library, in some cases the attack could be remote.

### Verbose

The problem takes place when a GIF file has invalid LWZ Minimum Code
Size in the Table Based Image Data header. The standard allows the
codes to have maximum size of 12 bits, but this is not checked in
SDL\_image.
An attacker could use this for a local or remote buffer overflow
attack that may have denial of service or arbitrary code execution
effect.

`SDL_image file IMG_gif.c, function ReadImage:
...
unsigned char c;
...
if (LWZReadByte(src, TRUE, c) < 0) {
RWSetMsg("error reading image");
return NULL;
}
/*
** If this is an "uninteresting picture" ignore it.
*/
if (ignore) {
while (LWZReadByte(src, FALSE, c) >= 0)
;
return NULL;
}
...`

Please note that 'c' value is passed to LZWReadByte without checking
if it is OK with the standard.

Then in function LWZReadByte:

`LWZReadByte(SDL_RWops *src, int flag, int input_code_size)
...
static int table[2][(1 << MAX_LWZ_BITS)];
...
set_code_size = input_code_size;
...
clear_code = 1 << set_code_size;
...
for (i = 0; i < clear_code; ++i) {
table[0][i] = 0;
table[1][i] = i;
}
...`

This is the first place that is affected by this issue.

### Versions affected and vendor status

Version 1.2.6 and prior are affected.

Vendor was informed and has fixed this issue in 1.2.7.

Due to usability issues the [visual editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVisualEditor "wikipedia:Wikipedia:VisualEditor") has been temporarily disabled. See [bug #910279](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910279) for more details.
#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

* Brief

SDL_Image is an open source library providing image file handling
functionality.
GIF format handling routines suffers from lack of proper buffer
size validating, which makes it vulnerable to a buffer overflow
attack. An attacker could DoS an application using SDL_Image,
or execute arbitrary code (this has not been confirmed, and
is believed to be nontrivial).
Since this is a library, in some cases the attack could be remote.

* Verbose

The problem takes place when a GIF file has invalid LWZ Minimum Code
Size in the Table Based Image Data header. The standard allows the
codes to have maximum size of 12 bits, but this is not checked in
SDL_image.
An attacker could use this for a local or remote buffer overflow
attack that may have denial of service or arbitrary code execution
effect.

SDL_image file IMG_gif.c, function ReadImage:

...
    unsigned char c;
...
    if (LWZReadByte(src, TRUE, c) < 0) {
    RWSetMsg("error reading image");
    return NULL;
    }
    /*
    **    If this is an "uninteresting picture" ignore it.
     */
    if (ignore) {
    while (LWZReadByte(src, FALSE, c) >= 0)
        ;
    return NULL;
    }
...

Please note that 'c' value is passed to LZWReadByte without checking
if it is OK with the standard.

Then in function LWZReadByte:

LWZReadByte(SDL_RWops *src, int flag, int input_code_size)
...
    static int table[[2]](#2)[(1 << MAX_LWZ_BITS)];
...
    set_code_size = input_code_size;
...
    clear_code = 1 << set_code_size;
...
    for (i = 0; i < clear_code; ++i) {
        table[[0]](#0)[i] = 0;
        table[[1]](#1)[i] = i;
    }
...

This is the first place that is affected by this issue.
