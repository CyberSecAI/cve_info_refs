  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_f26bb147_20250124_140644.html",
      "root_cause": "The XCMS application allows modification of the footer through a flawed page named `cpie.php` in the admin panel. This page saves changes without any input validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious PHP code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure file inclusion: The application includes the footer file without proper sanitization.",
        "Lack of input validation: The `cpie.php` page saves changes without validating user input.",
        "Missing exit() after header redirect: The `cpie.php` doesn't use `exit()` after a redirect, which can lead to unexpected code execution.",
           "Remote Code Execution: The ability to inject arbitrary PHP code leads to remote code execution."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote command execution on the server where XCMS is installed. An attacker can modify the website's content, alter the admin password, and potentially gain full control of the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP POST request to `cpie.php` with malicious PHP code in the `testo_0` parameter."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `cpie.php` page, potentially through a form, and must be able to bypass the authentication check in the `cpie.php` page, or authenticate as an administrator."
