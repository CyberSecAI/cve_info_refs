```
Root cause of vulnerability:
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `GetHistory` method of the `AnswerWorks` ActiveX control (awApi4.dll).

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Buffer overflow:  The `GetHistory` method does not properly validate the length of the input, allowing an attacker to write beyond the buffer's boundary.
- Active X control Vulnerability:  The vulnerability resides in an ActiveX control, making it exploitable through web browsers.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary code execution: By overwriting the return address, an attacker can redirect the flow of execution to their shellcode, enabling them to run malicious code on the victim's machine.

Attack vectors:
- Remote exploitation via web browser: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through a malicious webpage embedding the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- User interaction is required: The user must visit the attacker's malicious website or open a malicious HTML document.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to create a malicious website or HTML document embedding the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- Knowledge of shellcode development or utilization of existing shellcode.
- Understanding of the vulnerable application's memory structure (e.g., return addresses) to redirect the execution to the attacker's code.
