##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

What is iSEEK AnswerWorksâ¢?

![](images/elements/answer.man.gif)
iSEEK AnswerWorksâ¢ is a sophisticated search application developed by [Vantage Linguistics](http://www.vantagelinguistics.com) (formerly distributed by Wextech). The AnswerWorksâ¢ product allows product development teams and help system authors to enrich their existing help systems with linguistic and natural language based search. When embedded in a local or online help system, AnswerWorks searches multiple help resources and targets the most relevant and likely answers to users' queries, saving time for everyone involved.

Because iSEEK AnswerWorksâ¢ employs an intuitive, natural language interface and semantic search technology users can phrase their questions in everyday language and receive more accurate results. Answers are ranked by relevance based on the meaning of the query, so the most likely answer is always at the top of the list.

iSEEK AnswerWorksâ¢ is integrated into several world class software applications to provide the most efficient and meaningful interface to documentation and help files, so user's questions are returned with relevant search results.

Description of the Vulnerability:
Updated:12/11/07

A security vulnerability in versions 3.0.0.0 - 4.0.0.100 and 5.0.0.0 - 5.0.0.6 of the iSEEK AnswerWorksâ¢ Desktop runtime for Windows was found recently.

Questions and Answers

Q1.
What if I've uninstalled one of these products and no longer use it? Do I still need the patch?

A1.
As a precaution, we recommend that customers who have iSEEK Answerworks installed to download the patch.

If you have uninstalled products with iSEEK Answerworks included and prefer instead to verify that the affected versions of AnswerWorks are not on your computer, please follow the steps below. If the affected versions are not on your computer, no patch is necessary.

To determine if iSEEK AnswerWorks Version 4.0 or Version 5.0 is installed:

1. Right-Click on your "Start" menu and select "Explore."
2. Open the following folders in order: Local Disk (C:) > Program Files > Common Files. (Note: You may receive a message when you open your Program Files folder that "These Files are Hidden." Go ahead and click on the "Show the Contents of This Folder" link.) If you find a folder called "AnswerWorks 4.0" or "AnswerWorks 5.0" in your Common Files directory, it is strongly recommended that you apply the patch.

Q2.
How do I download and install the patch?

A2.
All affected users should download the security patch at:

[http://www.vantagelinguistics.com/downloads/awsecuritypatch.msi](/downloads/awsecuritypatch.msi)
When the page appears:

1. Click the "Download" button to start the download, or choose a different language from the drop-down list and click "Go."
2. Select "Open" or "Run This Program From its Current Location" to begin the patch immediately. Restarting your computer is not required.
3. If you don't have time to install the patch, or don't want to restart your computer, you can select "Save" or "Save This Program to Disk" and the patch file, called [awsecuritypatch.msi](/downloads/awsecuritypatch.msi), will download to your hard drive. You'll need to open that file to run the patch.

[^ top](/answerworks/release/#top)

Q3.
How do I check that the security patch has been applied?

A3.
To make sure the patch as been applied and that either iSEEK AnswerWorks 4.0 or iSEEK AnswerWorks 5.0 are installed on your system, do the following:
If the security patch has been applied, the iSEEK AnswerWorks 4.0 control will be at file version 4.0.0.101 or higher. You can check the version number by following these steps:

1. Right-click on your "Start" menu and select "Explore."
2. Open the following folders in order: Local Disk (C:) > Program Files > Common Files. (Note: You may receive a message when you open the Program Files folder that "These files are hidden." Go ahead and click on the "Show the Contents of This Folder" link.)
3. If you find a folder called "AnswerWorks 4.0," open it.
4. Right-click on the AWAPI4.dll (or AWAPI4) file and select "Properties."
5. Click the "Version" tab. If the file version is 4.0.0.101 the patch was installed successfully.

If the security patch has been applied, the iSEEK AnswerWorks 5.0 control will be at file version 5.0.0.7 or higher. You can check the version number by following these steps:

1. Use Windows Explorer to navigate to the directory - c:\Program Files\Common Files\AnswerWorks 5.0.
2. Right-click on the AWAPI5.dll file and select "Properties."
3. Click the "Version" tab.
4. Check that the File version is 5.0.0.7. If it is, this patch was installed correctly.

[^ top](/answerworks/release/#top)

Q4.
What operating systems are supported?

A4.
The security patch is available for all operating systems used by affected applications: Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 2000. If you are running Windows 98 or Windows ME, you need to have Internet Explorer 6.0 or later installed before you can install the update. Go to the Internet Explorer 6 Downloads Web page to install a more recent version of IE.
Note: Products for Apple Mac OS X are not affected.

Q5.
I only use the Internet on a periodic basis. Do I still need to download the security patch?

A5.
Yes. If you installed any of the affected products on your computer, the vulnerability poses a security risk regardless of whether you are currently connected to the Internet. We recommend that all affected users download and install the security patch.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
