- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly sanitize user input provided via the `layer` parameter in the `region.php` script, which allows for directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path/directory traversal vulnerability, leading to local file disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files or user data.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `region.php` script, with a malicious path in the `layer` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required.
