{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly uses the value of the `idevent` GET parameter in an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, leading to potential data breaches, modification, or complete compromise of the database. Specifically, the exploit shows how to extract user credentials, database name, and version information from the MySQL database.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through the `events.php` script via the `idevent` GET parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `events.php` script. No authentication or other specific capabilities are required beyond that."
