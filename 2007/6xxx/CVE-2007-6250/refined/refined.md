Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-6250:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `AOLMediaPlaybackControl.exe` application. This executable is used by the AOL AmpX and CoAxTrack ActiveX controls.
- The overflow is triggered through the `AppendFileToPlayList()` method in these ActiveX controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack buffer overflow:  A buffer on the stack is overflowed when processing data via the `AppendFileToPlayList()` method, allowing attackers to overwrite adjacent memory on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By exploiting the buffer overflow, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's system with the privileges of the user viewing the malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Remote Exploitation: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by enticing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document, such as a webpage, email, or attachment.
-  ActiveX Controls: The vulnerability exists within ActiveX controls that are used in web browsers, making web-based attacks possible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to Craft HTML: The attacker needs to craft malicious HTML to trigger the buffer overflow vulnerability by using the ActiveX control.
-  User Interaction: Requires user to open the crafted HTML document.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specifically located in `AOLMediaPlaybackControl.exe` which is used by the `AmpX.dll` and `axtrack.dll` ActiveX controls.
-  AOL provided updates that remove the `AmpX` control and the `AOLMediaPlaybackControl.exe` file to mitigate the vulnerability.
- Disabling the relevant ActiveX controls, or disabling ActiveX altogether in the Internet Zone, can prevent the exploit.
-  The vulnerability was reported by Will Dormann of the CERT/CC.
- The AmpX ActiveX control version 2.6.2.6 prevents the buffer overflow vulnerability in `AOLMediaPlaybackControl.exe` from being reached.
