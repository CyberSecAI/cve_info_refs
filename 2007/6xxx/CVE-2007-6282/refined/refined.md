{
  "CVE-2007-6282": {
    "description": "A remote attacker could crash the IPSec/IPv6 stack by sending a bad ESP packet.",
    "root_cause": "The Linux kernel's IPsec/IPv6 stack does not correctly handle fragmented ESP packets.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of fragmented ESP packets"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote Denial of Service. The vulnerable system crashes when it receives a specially crafted ESP packet.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted ESP packet to the vulnerable system"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send IPsec/IPv6 packets to the target system. The target must be configured to receive and process such packets. Firewalls may filter these packets by default.",
     "notes": "The vulnerability exists in all 2.6.x kernels. The issue is a fragmentation problem. If the ESP header is fragmented before the initialization vector (IV) ends, a BUG() is called, crashing the system. This vulnerability affects both IPv4 and IPv6 stacks."
