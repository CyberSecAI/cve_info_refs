Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `is_admin` function within the `mainfile.php` file of 123tkShop. The code is susceptible to SQL injection.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query used for user authentication.
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** This SQL injection vulnerability can be used to bypass the authentication mechanism and gain administrative access.
    *   **Insecure coding:** The code uses `base64_decode()` directly on user-supplied input, which makes it susceptible to SQL Injection regardless of `magic_quotes_gpc` being enabled or not.
    *   **Lack of input sanitization:** The code does not properly sanitize user input before using it in the SQL query.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Administrative Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain administrative privileges on the vulnerable 123tkShop instance.
    *   **Complete Control:** With administrative access, the attacker could potentially take full control of the application, access sensitive data, modify the site, and potentially perform further attacks on the server.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `admin` parameter in the `admin.php` URL. The malicious SQL injection payload, after being base64 encoded, is passed through this parameter. For example: `http://127.0.0.1/123tkShop/shop/admin.php?admin=J3VuaW9uIHNlbGVjdCAncGFzc3dvcmQnLyogOnBhc3N3b3Jk`

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable 123tkShop application.
    *   **No prior authentication is needed**

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit works regardless of `magic_quotes_gpc` being enabled, due to the use of `base64_decode()` on user-supplied input.
*   The exploit works regardless of `register_globals` settings, due to code using  `import_request_variables('GPC');`
*   The exploit is specific to 123tkShop version 0.9.1.
