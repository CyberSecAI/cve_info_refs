{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `map->count` variable within the `videobuf-vmalloc` driver was not being initialized after a call to `kmalloc`. This resulted in the count starting with a random value.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak due to uninitialized counter leading to improper resource management"
    ],
    "impact": "Leaking of videobufs which could eventually lead to memory exhaustion.",
    "attack_vectors": "Repeated calls to `mmap()` on a `/dev/video` device.",
    "required_capabilities": "User with access to a `/dev/video` device."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The fix replaces `kmalloc` with `kzalloc` which initializes the allocated memory to zero, thus preventing the uninitialized count from causing a leak. The debug statements were updated to print unsigned values which is more appropriate for the count."
