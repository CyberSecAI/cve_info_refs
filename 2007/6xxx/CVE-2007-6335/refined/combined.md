How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1435-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
December 19, 2007                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : clamav
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-6335 CVE-2007-6336

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Clam
anti-virus toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-6335

    It was discovered that an integer overflow in the decompression code
    for MEW archives may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-6336

    It was discovered that on off-by-one in the MS-ZIP decompression
    code may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.90.1-3etch8.

The old stable distribution (sarge) is not affected by these problems.
However, since the clamav version from Sarge cannot process all current
Clam malware signatures any longer, support for the ClamAV in Sarge is
now discontinued. We recommend to upgrade the the stable distribution
or run a backport of the stable version.

The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian 4.0 (stable)
- -------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- libexiv2 integer overflow problem
Meder Kydyraliev of Google found out that specially crafted
files could trigger an integer overflow in the libexiv2 library,
potentially causing code execution (CVE-2007-6353).
This problem affected openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3, updated packages were
released on December 21st.
- dvips buffer overflows / insecure tempfiles
Buffer overflows in dvips and dviljk could be triggered by specially
crafted dvi files (CVE-2007-5935, CVE-2007-5937).
dvips additionally created temporary files in an insecure manner
(CVE-2007-5936).
Update TeX packages have been released for all affected distributions
except openSUSE 10.3. openSUSE 10.3 texlive packages are still pending
due to unrelated problems.
- libsndfile possible buffer overflow
A possible buffer overflow that occurs while reading decoded PCM
data from the FLAC library was fixed in libsndfile. (CVE-2007-4974)
Updates have been released for all affected distributions containing
libsndfile on January 3rd.
- squid denial of service problem
The web browser squid was updated to fix a denial-of-service bug
during cache update reply processing. (CVE-2007-6239)
Squid has been updated on all SUSE Linux based products on
December 30.
- rsync directory traversal problems
A bug in rsync was fixed that allowed remote attackers to access
restricted files outside a module's hierarchy if no chroot setup
was used. (CVE-2007-6199)
Please also read <http://rsync.samba.org/security.html> entry
from November 28th, 2007 to get more information about a secure
configuration of rsync that also covers the bug tracked with
CVE-2007-6200.
This rsync update also fixes some crashes that only affect rsync-2.6.8
on SLES10.
The update was released on December 22nd.
- clamav 0.92 security update
The virus scan engine clamav was upgrade to 0.92 to fix numerous flaws including
some security problems (CVE-2007-6335, CVE-2007-6336, CVE-2007-6337).
Please note that the version number of the clamav library has
changed. Programs linked against libclamav therefore need to be
updated as well. We released klamav, claws and sylpheed-claws packages to
adjust this.
This update was released on December 20.
- Xen denial of service problems
Various Xen issues have been fixed, two of them security related:
- CVE-2007-5906: Xen allowed virtual guest system users to cause
a denial of service (hypervisor crash) by using a debug register
(DR7) to set certain breakpoints.
- CVE-2007-5907: Xen 3.1.1 does not prevent modification of the CR4
TSC from applications, which allows pv guests to cause a denial
of service (crash).
Updates have been released for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.3 and SUSE
Linux Enterprise Server 10. openSUSE 10.2 updates are still pending.

2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
- libexif vulnerabilities
A Google security audit also found problems in libexif. We are preparing
updates for these issues. (CVE-2007-6351/CVE-2007-6352)
- wireshark 0.99.7 security problems
Multiple bugs were fixed in wireshark 0.99.7, updated packages for these
problems are currently in QA.
- various MySQL security issues
We are currently testing a MySQL update to fix various security issues
discovered.
- krb5 small security issues
We are currently testing fixes for the reported krb5 security issues.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.

# ClamAV: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200712-20**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in ClamAV allowing remote
execution of arbitrary code and Denial of Service attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-antivirus/clamav** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.91.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.91.2-r1** |

### Background

Clam AntiVirus is a free anti-virus toolkit for UNIX, designed
especially for e-mail scanning on mail gateways.

### Description

iDefense reported an integer overflow vulnerability in the cli\_scanpe()
function when parsing Portable Executable (PE) files packed in the MEW
format, that could be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow
(CVE-2007-6335). Toeroek Edwin reported an off-by-one error when
decompressing MS-ZIP compressed CAB files (CVE-2007-6336). An
unspecified vulnerability related to the bzip2 decompression algorithm
has also been discovered (CVE-2007-6337).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to scan a
specially crafted file, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running ClamAV (either a system
user or the "clamav" user if clamd is compromised).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.91.2-r1"
```
### References
