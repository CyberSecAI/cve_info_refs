How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-6681 CVE-2007-6682 CVE-2007-6683 CVE-2008-0295
                 CVE-2008-0296 CVE-2008-0073 CVE-2008-0984 CVE-2008-1489

Luigi Auriemma, Alin Rad Pop, RÃ©mi Denis-Courmont, Quovodis, Guido
Landi, Felipe Manzano, Anibal Sacco and others discovered multiple
vulnerabilities in vlc, an application for playback and streaming of
audio and video.  In the worst case, these weaknesses permit a remote,
unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges
of the user running vlc.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following eight problems:

CVE-2007-6681

    A buffer overflow vulnerability in subtitle handling allows an
    attacker to execute arbitrary code through the opening of a
    maliciously crafted MicroDVD, SSA or Vplayer file.

CVE-2007-6682

    A format string vulnerability in the HTTP-based remote control
    facility of the vlc application allows a remote, unauthenticated
    attacker to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-6683

    Insecure argument validation allows a remote attacker to overwrite
    arbitrary files writable by the user running vlc, if a maliciously
    crafted M3U playlist or MP3 audio file is opened.

CVE-2008-0295, CVE-2008-0296

    Heap buffer overflows in RTSP stream and session description
    protocol (SDP) handling allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
    code if a maliciously-crafted RTSP stream is played.

CVE-2008-0073

    Insufficient integer bounds checking in SDP handling allows the
    execution of arbitrary code through a maliciously crafted SDP
    stream ID parameter in an RTSP stream.

CVE-2008-0984

    Insufficient integrity checking in the MP4 demuxer allows a remote
    attacker to overwrite arbitrary memory and execute arbitrary code
    if a maliciously-crafted MP4 file is opened.

CVE-2008-1489

    An integer overflow vulnerability in MP4 handling allows a remote
    attacker to cause a heap buffer overflow, inducing a crash and
    possibly the execution of arbitrary code if a maliciously-crafted
    MP4 file is opened.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.6-svn20061012.debian-5.1+etch2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.8.e-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.

# VLC: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200803-13**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC, allowing for the execution of
arbitrary code and Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/vlc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.8.6e** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.8.6e** |

### Background

VLC is a cross-platform media player and streaming server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC:

* Michal Luczaj
  and Luigi Auriemma reported that VLC contains boundary errors when
  handling subtitles in the ParseMicroDvd(), ParseSSA(), and
  ParseVplayer() functions in the modules/demux/subtitle.c file, allowing
  for a stack-based buffer overflow (CVE-2007-6681).
* The web
  interface listening on port 8080/tcp contains a format string error in
  the httpd\_FileCallBack() function in the network/httpd.c file
  (CVE-2007-6682).
* The browser plugin possibly contains an
  argument injection vulnerability (CVE-2007-6683).
* The RSTP
  module triggers a NULL pointer dereference when processing a request
  without a "Transport" parameter (CVE-2007-6684).
* Luigi
  Auriemma and Remi Denis-Courmont found a boundary error in the
  modules/access/rtsp/real\_sdpplin.c file when processing SDP data for
  RTSP sessions (CVE-2008-0295) and a vulnerability in the
  libaccess\_realrtsp plugin (CVE-2008-0296), possibly resulting in a
  heap-based buffer overflow.
* Felipe Manzano and Anibal Sacco
  (Core Security Technologies) discovered an arbitrary memory overwrite
  vulnerability in VLC's MPEG-4 file format parser (CVE-2008-0984).

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a long subtitle in a file that a user is
enticed to open, a specially crafted MP4 input file, long SDP data, or
a specially crafted HTTP request with a "Connection" header value
containing format specifiers, possibly resulting in the remote
execution of arbitrary code. Also, a Denial of Service could be caused
and arbitrary files could be overwritten via the "demuxdump-file"
option in a filename in a playlist or via an EXTVLCOPT statement in an
MP3 file.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All VLC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/vlc-0.8.6e"
```

If/when people agree on a timeout value that seems appropriate, let
me know, and I'll make that change in the LIVE555 code.

I had forgotten about that; I'll try to apply that next.

# Security issue: browser plugins input

As pointed out by Quovodis, browsers plugins must not be allowed to specify arbitrary input item options. In particular, controlling stream output is a big *no no* (writting to arbitrary files or to the network from web pages).

As far as I can tell, the simplest solution is to not allow items that start with a colon when initializing libvlc. However, it remains questionable whether even specifying arbitrary inputs should be allowed.

To upload designs, you'll need to enable LFS and have an admin enable hashed storage. [More information](/help/user/project/issues/design_management.md#prerequisites)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
