      "source": "trac.wordpress.org_341099fc_20250125_192403.html",
      "root_cause": "The WordPress authentication system uses a double MD5 hash of the user password to create authentication cookies. The database stores the MD5 hash of the password, and the cookie contains the MD5 hash of the MD5 hash of the password. This makes it easy to generate a valid cookie if an attacker gains read access to the database.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure storage of password hashes (MD5)",
        "Use of a double MD5 hash in cookies",
        "Lack of salting passwords",
        "Cookies do not expire",
        "Cookies are not bound to a specific IP address"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker with read access to the database can generate a valid login cookie for any user, gaining administrator access to the blog. The attacker can also gain access to other WordPress blogs if users share the same password across different sites.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "SQL injection",
        "Database backups being publicly exposed",
        "Compromised database access",

      "source": "www.cl.cam.ac.uk_7fd55db5_20250125_192403.html",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how WordPress creates authentication cookies using a double MD5 hash of the user password. The database stores the MD5 hash of the user's password, and the cookie stores the MD5 hash of that hash, making it trivial to generate valid cookies from database entries.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure storage of password hashes (MD5)",
        "Direct relationship between stored password hashes and cookie values through double hashing",
        "Lack of salting passwords",
        "Cookies do not expire",
            "No IP address binding for cookies"
      ],
        "impact": "An attacker with read access to the database can generate valid login cookies for any user, potentially escalating to administrator access. This vulnerability could be exploited in conjunction with SQL injection or by locating publicly accessible database backups.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "SQL injection vulnerabilities allowing read access to the database",
        "Exposure of database backups",
        "Any form of unauthorized read access to the wp_users table"
