Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-6127:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability lies in inadequate filtering of user-supplied input within SQL queries. Specifically, the `$_GET['year']` parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The application fails to properly sanitize user input before displaying it within the webpage, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.  The `$_GET["year"]` parameter is used to generate the `yearText` variable, which is then printed to the page without being escaped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   The `view.page.inc.php` script uses the `$_GET['year']` parameter directly in a SQL query within the `dbQuery` function.
    *   The `news.page.inc.php` script also uses the `$_GET['year']` parameter directly in a SQL query within the `dbQuery` function.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   The `xml/index.php` script takes the `$_GET["year"]` parameter and directly prints a string based on it to the page, allowing for the injection of scripts.
    *   The `view.page.inc.php` script takes the `$_GET['year']` parameter and prints it to the page, allowing for the injection of scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, and other information stored in the database.
    *   Attackers could modify database records and alter the application's intended behavior.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser.
    *   This could lead to session hijacking, account compromise, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   By manipulating the `year` parameter in the URL when accessing the `view.page.inc.php` or `news.page.inc.php` scripts, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   By manipulating the `year` parameter in the URL when accessing the `xml/index.php` or `view.page.inc.php` scripts, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No special privileges or positions are required to exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker needs to have some understanding of SQL and web application vulnerabilities to craft the necessary exploit payloads.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided exploit information notes that `magic_quotes_gpc` must be turned off for the SQL injection to work.
*   The Exploit-DB entry also references CVE-2007-6126, however, this entry does not detail the specifics of that vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable application is project alumni version 1.0.9 and possibly lower.
