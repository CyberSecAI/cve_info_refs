- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is a unicode buffer overflow in the function that builds error messages in Zoom Player.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: A unicode buffer overflow is present in the function used for creating error messages.
- Impact of exploitation: The buffer overflow can be exploited through a malformed ZPL file to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.
- Attack vectors: A local attack vector is used where the attacker crafts a malicious ZPL file containing a long http link to a PLS file. When Zoom Player attempts to process this link during error handling, it uses wsprintf which leads to the overflow.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted .zpl file to the user of the vulnerable Zoom Player application.
