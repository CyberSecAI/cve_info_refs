Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-6690:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Description:** The Gallery Remote module in Menalto Gallery before 2.2.4 does not check permissions for unspecified GR commands.

*   **Root Cause:**  Missing permission checks in the Gallery Remote module for certain GR commands.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing Permissions Check:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks for GR commands within the Gallery Remote module. This allows unauthorized access to functionality within the module.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   The impact is described as having "unknown impact and attack vectors".  This implies the potential for a variety of malicious activities depending on the functionality of the exposed GR commands. The content doesn't specify what an attacker could achieve, but the lack of permission checks could lead to unauthorized data access, modification or other actions that would not be available to an unauthenticated user.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is described as "unspecified", meaning the exact way the attacker would exploit this is not detailed. The vulnerability lies in the Gallery Remote module, suggesting that the attacker would likely interact with the module to send these commands.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker is remote and needs to be able to send commands to the Gallery Remote module. The content does not state if any prior knowledge of GR commands would be required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes information about other vulnerabilities fixed in Gallery 2.2.4. These are related to other CVEs (CVE-2007-6685, CVE-2007-6686, CVE-2007-6687, CVE-2007-6688, CVE-2007-6689, CVE-2007-6691, CVE-2007-6692, CVE-2007-6693).
*   A user reports a successful attack, where an overlong URL was sent to "main.php" in Gallery 2.0 allowing for code execution via FrontPage, however this is not directly related to the vulnerabilities fixed in version 2.2.4, although the upgrade to 2.2.4 is reported as a fix. This may hint at a separate issue that may also be address by the upgrade.

**Summary of CVE-2007-6690:**

The vulnerability in CVE-2007-6690 is a missing permissions check within the Gallery Remote module of Menalto Gallery versions prior to 2.2.4. This allows an attacker to send arbitrary commands without proper authorization. The exact consequences are unknown and depend on the functionality of the accessible GR commands. The attacker is remote and would send these GR commands directly to the Gallery Remote module.
