```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `isusweb.dll` ActiveX control of Macrovision InstallShield. The vulnerability occurs when the `DownloadAndExecute` method is called with a specially crafted string.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stack-based buffer overflow. The SEH (Structured Exception Handling) overwrite is used as the exploitation technique to gain control of the execution flow.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system, leading to complete compromise.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by tricking a user into visiting a malicious web page that uses the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page and persuade the victim to visit the page with a vulnerable version of the ActiveX control. The user would need to have the InstallShield software installed.
