{
  "CVE-2007-6016": {
    "Description": "The Symantec BackupExec Calendar Control (PVCalendar.ocx) is vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow. By providing an overly long string to the _DOWText0 property, a malicious actor can cause a buffer overflow allowing for arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable machine. This vulnerability is exploitable by tricking a user into opening a malicious HTML file.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the PVCalendar.ocx control when handling an overly long string assigned to the _DOWText0 property.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable machine.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "The attack vector is remote and requires tricking a user into opening a malicious HTML file, typically through a web browser."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "An attacker needs to create a malicious HTML file that contains the exploit code. The attacker also needs a way to get the victim to open the HTML file, usually via social engineering or phishing."
    ],
    "Additional Information": "The exploit code provided in the exploit-db entry targets the PVCalendar.ocx version 10.0.0.17, tested on Windows XP SP2 with IE6 and IE7. The exploit uses JavaScript to create a large string and then assign this string to the _DOWText0 property in the ActiveX control which triggers the buffer overflow. Shellcode is embedded within the exploit to provide a calculator pop or bind shell."
