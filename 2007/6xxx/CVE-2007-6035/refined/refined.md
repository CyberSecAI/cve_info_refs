Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-6035:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in Cacti's `graph.php` file. Specifically, the `local_graph_id` variable is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. This is caused by the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input that's directly used in an SQL statement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to inject and execute arbitrary SQL code on the vulnerable Cacti server.
- This can lead to the attacker gaining unauthorized access to the database, potentially reading sensitive data (like user passwords, as shown in the example), modifying data, or even gaining control of the server in the worst case.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote. An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the `graph.php` file, injecting malicious SQL code through the `local_graph_id` parameter.
- Example: `/cacti/graph.php?local_graph_id=-1+union+select+1,2,3,password+from+user_auth+where+id=1/*`
  
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Cacti server.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Cacti versions prior to 0.8.7a.
- Patches were made available for both 0.8.7 and 0.8.6j branches.
- The vulnerability was initially reported on the Cacti forums and subsequently addressed in a security release.
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially read sensitive data, as demonstrated by the example, where an attacker can obtain the admin password from the database.
