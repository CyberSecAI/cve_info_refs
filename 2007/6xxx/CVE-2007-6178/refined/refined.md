- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `confdir` parameter in `dbutil.bck.php` and `dbutil.php` files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The application includes files based on the user-controlled `confdir` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, leading to remote code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL including a malicious file path in the `confdir` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to a publicly hosted malicious PHP file. The `register_globals` setting must be enabled for the vulnerability to work.
