Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the `global_lang` parameter of several PHP files within the Social Engine 2.0 application. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary file paths.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI, which allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary files from the server.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Code Execution:** By including malicious files, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the server.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through specially crafted GET requests to vulnerable PHP files by manipulating the `global_lang` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    *   **No Authentication Required** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, as the vulnerable parameters are in the URL.

**Summary:**

The provided content describes a Local File Inclusion vulnerability in Social Engine 2.0. By exploiting the `global_lang` parameter in several PHP files, an attacker can include arbitrary local files, potentially leading to code execution or information disclosure. The exploit is triggered via crafted HTTP GET requests.
