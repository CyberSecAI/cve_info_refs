```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to an insecure `require` statement in the `xajax_functions.php` file of the Joomla! component `com_juser`. The `mosConfig_absolute_path` variable is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability

Impact of exploitation:
- An attacker can execute arbitrary code by including a malicious file from a remote server.
- This can lead to complete compromise of the vulnerable Joomla! installation.

Attack vectors:
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to `/administrator/components/com_juser/xajax_functions.php`, supplying the URL of a malicious file in the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to host or control a server with a malicious PHP file that can be included.
