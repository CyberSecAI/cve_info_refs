  ],
  "Root cause": "The root cause is that Tomcat's native (APR based) connector does not properly handle an empty connection over SSL, leading to the processing of a duplicate request.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Improper handling of empty requests over SSL",
    "Inadequate validation in the APR connector"
  ],
  "Impact": "Processing of a duplicate request can lead to data integrity issues.",
  "Attack vector": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by establishing an SSL connection, sending no data, and then disconnecting.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish an SSL connection to the vulnerable Tomcat instance, which requires network access to the server.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "Tomcat versions 5.5.11-5.5.25",
    "Tomcat versions 6.0.0-6.0.15"
