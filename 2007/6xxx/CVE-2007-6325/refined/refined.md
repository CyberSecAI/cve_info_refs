```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the `designconfig.php` file of Fastpublish CMS 1.9999. The script directly includes the value of the `config[fsBase]` parameter without proper sanitization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The code uses `@include($config['fsBase'])`, which makes the application vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion. An attacker can provide a URL to a remote file via the `config[fsBase]` parameter, which will then be included and executed by the server.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file from a remote location. This could lead to complete compromise of the system, data theft, or further attacks.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to `designconfig.php` with a crafted `config[fsBase]` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Fastpublish CMS. They don't need any authentication or prior access to the system.
