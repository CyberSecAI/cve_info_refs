Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-6004:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in Toko Instan v7.6. Specifically, the `id` variable in the "artikel" section and the `katid` variable in the "produk" section of the `index.php` file are not properly filtered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities are present in the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can manipulate SQL queries through the browser to extract sensitive information, potentially including usernames and passwords of members stored in the 'member' table.
- Complete compromise of the database is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible remotely through HTTP requests by manipulating the vulnerable parameters: `id` and `katid`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit demonstrates the use of a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data from the `member` table.
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) URLs reveal how the `id` and `katid` variables are vulnerable to SQL injection.
- The POCs aim to extract `userid` and `password` from the `member` table.
- The first POC extracts userid and password using separate columns, the second one extracts them concatenated.
