#### [I have finished downloading, where do I find it?](#collapse-3-9295)

The best way to know where your download saved is to pay close attention to the “Save As” window at the beginning of the download process. Once you have clicked the download button and selected the option to save the file, you will be given the “Save As” window, which shows you exactly where your download is being saved to on your computer. If you know the filename, you can do a search on your computer for it.

What happened to the Map feature in ACDSee 2021 and older?[Yoko Zarry](https://www.acdsee.com/en/author/yzarry/ "Posts by Yoko Zarry")2022-11-22T22:47:24+00:00
#### [What happened to the Map feature in ACDSee 2021 and older?](#collapse-4-106000)

Google Maps API support for Internet Explorer 11 has ended. As a result of this change by Google, the Map feature in ACDSee 2021 and older no longer functions. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

In ACDSee 2022 and newer, the Map feature has been updated to use Microsoft Edge WebView2 in place of Internet Explorer 11. Sign in to your [acdID account](https://acdid.acdsee.com/login) to access exclusive upgrade pricing.
