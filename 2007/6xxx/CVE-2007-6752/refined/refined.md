Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2007-6752:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The primary root cause is inadequate session checking and improper input validation within Drupal 7.12, specifically regarding the handling of form tokens and HTTP methods.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability (General Settings Change):** Drupal uses `form_token` for security, but the same token is used for similar operations within a session. This, combined with the ability to use any valid `form_build_id` (instead of the one generated for the specific operation), allows an attacker to craft malicious requests.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability (Forced Logout):** The `/user/logout` endpoint lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to force a user or admin to log out by a crafted web page.
*  **HTTP Method Bypass:** Drupal does not enforce the use of specific HTTP methods, allowing POST to be used for logout instead of GET.
*   **Missing Referer Check:** Drupal doesn't perform HTTP referer checks, exacerbating the above vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Settings Manipulation:** An attacker could make arbitrary changes to the Drupal settings (e.g., add/remove users, add/remove pages), potentially leading to complete compromise of the site.
*   **Forced Logout:** Attackers can force administrators to log out, potentially aiding in credential sniffing, especially during a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary attack vector is CSRF. The attacker crafts a malicious web page that, when visited by a logged-in Drupal user (especially an administrator), sends requests to the Drupal site, taking advantage of the weaknesses in session handling.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** While not a direct attack vector for the vulnerability itself, a MitM attack can help an attacker to obtain the valid `form_build_id` and `form_token` values needed for the general settings change exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to get a logged-in Drupal user (especially an administrator) to visit a crafted web page controlled by the attacker.
*   For the general settings change vulnerability, the attacker needs to obtain the valid form_token and form_build_id parameters either through MitM, a client side exploit, or by compromising a logged in user.
*   For forced logout, the attacker simply needs to get the victim to load a malicious page.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The report mentions that Drupal's handling of form tokens was considered a "security improvement" rather than a fix for the reported vulnerabilities by MITRE CVE Numbering Authority.
*   The vendor disputes the significance of the logout issue as a vulnerability, citing performance impact and complexity as reasons not to change the logout behavior.
*  The issue was also reproducible in Drupal 6.
