Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `showMsg.php` file of MailMachine Pro 2.2.4.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious code through the `id` parameter in the `showMsg.php` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can use the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** As demonstrated in the provided exploit, the vulnerability can be used to retrieve user credentials such as the username and password of the admin user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `showMsg.php` and injecting SQL code through the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax to craft the malicious SQL injection payload

**Exploit Details:**
* The provided exploit URL `http://[site]/showMsg.php?id=-1+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,6,concat(user_id,char(58),password),8,9,10+from+mailmachine_users/*` demonstrates how the attacker can use a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract the username and password from the `mailmachine_users` table.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.2.6 of MailMachine Pro.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by MhZ91

The provided information gives a clear understanding of the vulnerability, including the specific attack vector and how to exploit it.
