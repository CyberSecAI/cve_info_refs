  "relatedContent": [
    {
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_1ef459b6_20250125_133405.html",
      "vulnerability": {
        "rootCause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "SQL Injection"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, potentially including user credentials (usernames and passwords, which are stored in plaintext).",
         "attackVectors": [
          "The vulnerability is located in the `albums.php` script, specifically the `id` parameter within the URL.",
		  "The attacker can inject SQL code using a crafted URL by including a malicious SQL query in the 'id' parameter of albums.php, which is then executed against the database."
        ],
        "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application. The attacker must also create an account and log in before the injection will work.",
		"additionalDetails": "Passwords are stored in plain text, making it easier for an attacker to obtain credentials. The exploit provides a sample malicious query: `www.site.com/albums.php?mode=editalbum&id=-1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,concat(user,char(58),password),3/**/FROM/**/users/**/LIMIT/**/0,1/*`"
