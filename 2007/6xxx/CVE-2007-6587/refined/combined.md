I think the above is actually a dupe to:

<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2007-6587>

I have updated OSVDB 39764 with this tech note:

This vulnerability was re-discovered May 21, 2012 but no version was
listed. Based on the vendor's page, availability of 1.0-RC1 was made after
the initial disclosure and confirmed to have included changeset 489, which
fixes the vulnerability. However, the 2012 disclosure indicates that the
vulnerability was tested against the plogger.com demo site which likely
was not upgraded to 1.0-RC1. Based on that, OSVDB believes that this is a
duplicate issue.
