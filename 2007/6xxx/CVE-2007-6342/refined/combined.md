/ Changes

```
Revision history for mod_perl module Apache::AuthCAS

Release 0.5
===========
Sun Mar 23 15:23:09 PDT 2008
	- fixed a security vulnerability where a tainted cookie could be sent
	  by a malicious user and it would be used in an SQL query without
	  protection against SQL injection.  All database calls have been updated
	  to use bind parameters to prevent this possibility.
	- patch to allow for DBs other than PostgreSQL

Release 0.4
===========
1.7  Tue Oct 12 17:33:24 PDT 2004
	- fixed a bug which made AuthCAS only initialize once.  This meant that
	  only one configuration could be used on any host properly.  Fixed to
	  allow single-configuration setups for speed with STATIC_INITIALIZATION
	  flag.  This "enhancement" sneaked into 0.3 without being logged below =P

Tue Oct 12 16:18:38 PDT 2004
	- spec file generated with cpan2rpm and then modified.  The old file was
      broken

Release 0.3
===========
1.6  Tue Oct 05 15:37:00 2004
	- redirect user to error page instead of login in the invalid PGT case.
	  This will prevent looping redirects in the case there is a
      misconfiguration
	- static configuration initialization (initially not logged)

1.5  Tue Oct 05 15:26:00 2004
	- fixed a bug that was causing invalid PGT to be used when CAS session had
	  expired

Release 0.2
===========

1.4  Wed Sep 15 13:07:00 2004
    - fixed wrong package name Apache::CAS to Apache::AuthCAS

Release 0.1
===========
1.3  Wed Sep 15 11:41:00 2004
    - POD documentation update, had incorrect dependency listed
      Net::SSLeay was listed twice instead of including MIME::Base64

1.2  Wed Sep 15 11:26:00 2004
    - Changed session/pgt cleanup to a more consistent method
    - Initialization only occurs once, not hitting the directory
      config for every protected request
    - Added ability to masquerade as a "Basic Auth" module

1.0  Fri Aug 13 05:57:00 2004
    - initial version

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
