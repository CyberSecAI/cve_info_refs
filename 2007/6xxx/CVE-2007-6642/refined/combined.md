[HSC] Multiple CSRF in Joomla all versions - Complete compromise
Hackers Center Security Group (http://www.hackerscenter.com)
Credit: Armando Romeo aka Zinho
Class: CSRF
Remote: Yes
Risk: HIGH
Product: Joomla
Version: All (1.0.13 and 1.5 rc3 tested)
Vendor: http://www.joomla.com
Patch: Joomla 1.5 RC4
"Joomla! is one of the most powerful Open Source Content Management
Systems on the planet. It is used all over the world for everything
from simple websites to complex corporate applications. Joomla! is easy
to install, simple to manage, and reliable"
Joomla is vulnerable to CSRF attacks into all of its released versions
including the RC3 of 1.5.
+] Affected areas
-Users
The attack allows everyone (no privileges needed) to add a new Super
Admin by just having a Super Admin visiting a url
-Extension installation
The attack allow everyone (no privileges needed) to upload an extension
from a remote location, thus having malicious PHP scripts on server.
Read PHP shell.
-Global configuration
The attack allows everyone (no privileges needed) to change all the
aspects of the site main configuration, including database configuration.
Defacement or complete portal compromise is possible including having
access to the database.
+] Notes
Joomla has been contacted on 12/4/2007. Fast and professional response
was given. Patched in SVN 4 days later and then with the RC4 release.
Time to face CSRF, community!
+] Patch
Patch of the above vulnerabilities is included into the RC4 release of
Joomla 1.5
As far as I know 1.0 has not been fixed so all the 1.0.x versions are
vulnerable and unpatched,
that's why I'm not including a POC here.

will ever find on the net!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
