Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2007-6215
*   **Vulnerable Software:** Web-MeetMe 3.0.3
*   **Vulnerability:** Remote File Disclosure
*   **Root Cause:** The `play.php` script is vulnerable to path traversal. The `roomNo` and `bookid` parameters are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files by manipulating the path in these parameters.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Path traversal vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`.
*   **Attack Vectors:** HTTP GET requests to `play.php` with manipulated `roomNo` or `bookid` parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and needs to know the location of the vulnerable script (`play.php`).

**Additional Details**
*   The exploit is demonstrated with example URLs using `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`. The `%00` is used to truncate the file path.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Evil.Man on 2007-11-29.
