Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-6660:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is caused by improper error handling within the 2z project application. Specifically, when an invalid template is requested through the `index.php` file, or when certain year and month parameters are passed to the default URI, the application reveals the server's file path within error messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information, specifically the server's directory structure, through error messages.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (template names, year and month parameters) before using them, which leads to the generation of error messages that include file paths.
* **Improper Error Handling**: The application's error handling mechanism displays verbose errors, revealing sensitive information instead of providing generic messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Attackers can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure, which may expose sensitive files, configuration settings, or other application details.
*   **Preparation for Further Attacks:** The path disclosure can be used to facilitate more targeted attacks such as exploiting other vulnerabilities that might be present in the application or the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited through specially crafted HTTP GET requests.
    *   Request to `index.php` with an invalid template parameter (e.g., `index.php?template=test`).
    *   Request to the default URI with specific year and month parameters (e.g., `?year=1234&month=06`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable 2z project server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without the need for prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content mentions this vulnerability alongside other vulnerabilities in the 2z project (CVE-2007-6659 and CVE-2007-6661), all addressed in the same advisory.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-200 (Information Exposure).
*   The CVSS v2 base score is 5.0, with a vector of (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N), indicating a medium risk rating.
*   The exploit is simple to carry out and can be done remotely.
