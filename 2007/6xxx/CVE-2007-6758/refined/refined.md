The provided content discusses a potential vulnerability in `feed-proxy.php` of Ext 1.0 alpha1, which is claimed to be a remote file disclosure through directory traversal in Milw0rm 3800 / Bugtraq 23643. However, the analysis of the code shows that the vulnerability is likely false.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**

The initial claim is a directory traversal vulnerability via the `feed` parameter in `feed-proxy.php`. However, the code checks if the `feed` parameter starts with `http`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The code provided by the user shows that the `feed` parameter is validated using `strpos($feed, 'http') === 0`. This prevents direct path traversal attacks. If `allow_url_fopen` is enabled, this could be used to access files via http/https, but this would be a separate issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The content argues there isn't a direct file disclosure vulnerability as initially described and if allow_url_fopen is enabled then this could be used as a proxy to reach remote files.

**Attack Vectors:**

The initial claim was using path traversal `../../../../../../etc/passwd` which, the analysis indicates is not a viable attack vector. The only potential attack vector, with `allow_url_fopen` enabled would be using a URL that would proxy a remote resource.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would need the `allow_url_fopen` enabled on the server, in order to proxy remote resources. The attacker would not be able to access local files via path traversal.

**Conclusion:**

The provided content argues that the described vulnerability of remote file disclosure due to path traversal is false. The code explicitly checks if the feed parameter starts with `http`. If `allow_url_fopen` is enabled, remote file access is possible, but it is not an RFI by path traversal as described in the original report (Milw0rm 3800 / Bugtraq 23643).

Based on this analysis, the content indicates the CVE is likely related to a vulnerability that has been incorrectly reported or exploited, and does not align with the actual code. Therefore the analysis is more of a refutation.

**Response:** NOINFO
