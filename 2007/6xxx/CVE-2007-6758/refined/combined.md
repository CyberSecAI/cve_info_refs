Someone help me out please... Milw0rm 3800 / Bugtraq 23643 are for a
flaw that looks like a directory traversal; ie,

Exploit:[Path_ext]/examples/layout/feed-proxy.php?feed=../../../../../../etc/passwd

Yet when I look at the code from either version 1.0 alpha 1 (from
<<http://yui-ext.com/deploy/ext-1.0-alpha1.zip>>), which is supposedly
affected, or 1.0 (from <<http://extjs.com/deploy/ext-1.0.zip>>), the
latest version, the affected file has the following code:

   $feed = $_REQUEST['feed'];
   if($feed != '' && strpos($feed, 'http') === 0){
           header('Content-Type: text/xml');
           readfile($feed);
           return;
   }

Now doesn't the strpos() along with the "===" test mean that the feed
parameter must start with "http"??? So did Alkomandoz Hacker bother to
test his/her proof of concept???

Now I suppose if the remote has allow_url_fopen enabled, you might be
able to abuse this to try to hide yourself from attacks against
third-party sites, but that's a separate issue.
