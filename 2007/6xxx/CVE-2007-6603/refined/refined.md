Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the "Hot or Not Clone" script by Jnshosts.com. The script's backup functionality allows unauthorized access to a database backup file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Backup Handling:** The script creates a database backup file (backup.php) that is accessible without authentication.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The backup file (backup.sql) contains the administrator's username and password in plaintext.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The script allows administrators to upload banners, which could be exploited by uploading a PHP shell.
*  **Lack of proper Input Sanitization** When uploading banner, there's no proper file validation which leads to arbitrary file upload.
*   **Predictable File Location**: Backup files are predictably named and stored.
*   **Lack of access control** Access control is lacking to restrict access to the backup file and the admin control panel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete compromise of the web application:** An attacker can obtain the administrator's username and password from the backup.sql file.
*   **Administrative Access:** With the obtained credentials, the attacker can access the admin control panel.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can upload a malicious PHP shell using the banner upload feature.
*   **Full System Takeover:** By exploiting the vulnerabilities, an attacker can gain control of the webserver, leading to data theft, defacement or more attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access:** Attackers can directly access the database backup file via a predictable URL (`/control/backup/backup.php`).
*   **Admin Panel Access:** Attackers can log in to the admin panel using the stolen username and password.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Attackers can upload malicious files using the banner upload feature (`/control/sitebanners/upload_banners.php`).
*  **Direct Shell Access:** After uploading malicious file, attacker can directly access it via url (`/banners/tryag.php`)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs to know that the "Hot or Not Clone" script is vulnerable.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server where the script is installed.
* **Web browser**: An attacker needs a web browser to access vulnerable urls

**Additional details:**

*   The exploit description details the steps to download the backup file, extract the admin credentials, log in to the admin panel, and upload a shell.
*   The exploit was published on December 28, 2007.
