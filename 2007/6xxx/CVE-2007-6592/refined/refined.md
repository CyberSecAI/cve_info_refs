Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the failure of certain browsers to bind a user-approved web server certificate to the originating domain name. This means that once a user accepts a certificate (even temporarily) for one domain, the browser might incorrectly trust it for a different domain if that domain is present in the certificate's `subjectAltName` field, even if the certificate was not originally issued for that second domain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Certificate-Hostname Binding:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a mechanism to link accepted certificates to the specific hostnames they were initially approved for.
- **`subjectAltName` Misuse:** The `subjectAltName` extension, intended to provide alternative names for a certificate, is exploited to spoof other domains.
- **Hidden `subjectAltName`:** Browsers do not display the `subjectAltName` field in the standard certificate view, hiding the presence of potentially malicious domain names from the user, preventing them from making an informed decision about whether to trust a certificate.
- **Wildcard Matching Issues:** Some browsers exhibit "loose matching" of wildcard domain names (e.g., `*.com` matching `www.example.com`), and even match the wildcard "*" to any hostname, further exacerbating the issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Certificate Spoofing:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to perform certificate spoofing. A user might be tricked into accepting a certificate for a legitimate domain, and then later, the attacker can use the same certificate to impersonate another domain without raising any security warnings.
- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can leverage this to conduct sophisticated phishing attacks. They can initially establish trust with a victim through a legitimate-looking site, and then exploit that trust to impersonate sensitive sites, like banking portals, without triggering security warnings.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** This vulnerability can be used in combination with a MITM attack, where the attacker can intercept the connection and present the spoofed certificate without the user noticing.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **MITM Attacks:** The attacker redirects the user's browser to a controlled server using techniques like DNS spoofing or other MITM attacks, or through a domain name hijacking.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker initially lures the user to a seemingly benign site and tricks them into accepting the malicious certificate. The user is then redirected to the spoofed website.
- **Self-Signed Certificates:** The attacker utilizes self-signed certificates with malicious `subjectAltName` fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be capable of:
    - Setting up a web server.
    - Obtaining or creating a certificate with a crafted `subjectAltName` field.
    - Redirecting traffic to their server through DNS spoofing, MITM attacks or domain hijacking.

**Affected Software:**
The following browsers are mentioned as being affected by the `no-cert-name-binding` issue:
- Browsers based on Mozilla <=1.9a8 (including Firefox 2, Iceweasel 2, IceApe 1.1.5, Netscape 9, SeaMonkey 1.1.5, Epiphany 2.18.1, K-Meleon 1.12)
- Konqueror
- Safari 2

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a detailed analysis of the various aspects of the vulnerability, including a demonstration.
- It highlights the severity of the issue, particularly as it had been known for a long time without being fully addressed.
- It points out that storing server certificates does not fully solve the issue if the user is not correctly prompted when connecting to the certificate again using a different hostname.
