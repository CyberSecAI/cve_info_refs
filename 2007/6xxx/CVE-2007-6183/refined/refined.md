{
  "CVE-2007-6183": {
    "description": "A format string vulnerability exists in the `Gtk::MessageDialog.new()` method of the ruby-gnome2 library. This vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary code when a specially crafted string is passed to the affected function.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a format string error within the `Gtk::MessageDialog.new()` method in `gtk/src/rbgtkmessagedialog.c`. The 'message' parameter is passed unsanitized to the `gtk_message_dialog_new` function, which is expecting a proper format string.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Format String Vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could send a specially crafted string, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application using the vulnerable library.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By crafting a message containing format string specifiers and passing it to the vulnerable `Gtk::MessageDialog.new()` method."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to pass a string to the vulnerable method. This can be accomplished remotely if the application using this library processes external input in a vulnerable way."
    },
    "affected_products": [
      "ruby-gnome2 versions prior to 0.16.0-r2 (Gentoo)",
      "ruby-gnome2 versions prior to 0.15.0-1.1etch1 (Debian etch)",
      "ruby-gnome2 versions prior to 0.12.0-2sarge1 (Debian sarge)",
      "ruby-gnome2 versions prior to 0.16.0-10 (Debian sid)",
      "ruby-gnome2 versions prior to 0.16.0-18.fc8 (Fedora 8)",
        "ruby-gnome2 versions prior to 0.16.0-18.fc7 (Fedora 7)"
    ],
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability and a patch were initially reported by Chris Rohlf on his blog. The vulnerability's exploitation depends on how the application uses the vulnerable function. Some example programs from the official Ruby/Gnome2 website were also vulnerable. The fix was committed to the upstream SVN repository."
