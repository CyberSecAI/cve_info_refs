- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Vidalia bundle, prior to version 0.1.2.18, included an insecurely configured Privoxy installation. Specifically, the `config.txt` file had the `enable-remote-toggle`, `enable-edit-actions` options enabled, and on Windows, `enable-remote-http-toggle` was also enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the insecure configuration of Privoxy, which allows remote manipulation via web requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious sites or exit nodes can inject active content that can:
    - Bypass or disable Privoxy filtering.
    - Establish direct connections to the local proxy to modify user-defined configurations.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves malicious active content (JavaScript, Java, Flash) injected into web pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be a malicious site or a malicious exit node injecting content into otherwise trusted sites. The attacker needs to be able to inject code into a webpage the victim visits. No user interaction is mentioned beyond normal browsing.
