Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described in the JIRA Security Advisory 2007-12-24:

**1. XSS vulnerability in Issue Actions**

*   **Root cause:** The `500page.jsp` file does not properly HTML-escape error messages, allowing user-provided input to be interpreted as HTML or CSS.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact:** A malicious user could inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript into the error messages which could lead to:
    *   Stealing session cookies or other credentials by sending them to the attacker's web server.
    *   Displaying malicious content to other users, potentially damaging the company's reputation.
*   **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript into input fields that get propagated to error messages.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A malicious user needs to be able to trigger an error condition that results in the display of a crafted message on the `500page.jsp` page. This may involve exploiting a vulnerability or intentionally causing a fault in user input to trigger the error display.

**2. Anyone can delete a filter which is shared with them**

*   **Root cause:** Lack of proper authorization checks when deleting filters.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**  Inadequate access control.
*   **Impact:** Users can delete filters owned by other users, causing inconvenience to the actual owners of the filters.
*   **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the filter ID during a delete request to target another user's shared filter instead of their own.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have access to a JIRA instance and knowledge of the ID of a filter shared with them by another user.

**3. Default language setting can be changed by an unauthorised user**

*   **Root cause:** The Setup Wizard's first page is accessible even after JIRA setup, and the language setting can be modified without security checks.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Lack of authorization controls and Improper access control.
*  **Impact**: A malicious user can change the default language of the JIRA instance, which is inconvenient to users and can be damaging to the company's reputation.
*   **Attack vectors:** By directly accessing the Setup Wizard's URL and modifying the language setting.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to access the JIRA instance and manually navigate to the Setup Wizard URL.

The advisory also mentions the availability of patches for JIRA versions 3.12, 3.11, and 3.10.2. These vulnerabilities are rated as High for the XSS issue and Low for the other two.
