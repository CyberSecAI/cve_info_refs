{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "source": "exploit-db.com",
      "root_cause": "The PMOS Help Desk application does not properly handle header redirects in `form.php`. Specifically, after a header redirect using the `Header()` function at lines 29 and 33, the script does not exit, allowing subsequent code to execute. This allows an attacker to inject PHP code into the 'options' table.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "PHP code injection",
        "Missing exit() after header redirect",
         "Improper input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote command execution. An attacker can inject malicious PHP code into the database and execute arbitrary commands on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP POST request to form.php with malicious code injected into the header parameter",
         "HTTP GET request to index.php which executes the injected php code using eval()"
      ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `form.php` script and have a basic understanding of HTTP requests. No authentication is needed."
