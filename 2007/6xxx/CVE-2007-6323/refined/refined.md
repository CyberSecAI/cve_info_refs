{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter when handling file requests.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Path traversal vulnerability, allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended web directory.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, or user data.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to vulnerable scripts (`get_image.php` or `get_file.php`) with a modified `id` parameter containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server and have knowledge of the server's directory structure to craft the path traversal sequences."
