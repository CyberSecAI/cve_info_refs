# zzuf - multi-purpose fuzzer

zzuf is a transparent application input fuzzer. Its purpose is to find bugs in applications by corrupting their user-contributed data (which more than often comes from untrusted sources on the Internet). It works by intercepting file and network operations and changing random bits in the program’s input. zzuf’s behaviour is deterministic, making it easier to reproduce bugs. Its main areas of use are:

* **quality assurance**: use zzuf to test existing software, or integrate it into your own software’s testsuite
* **security**: very often, segmentation faults or memory corruption issues mean a potential security hole, zzuf helps exposing some of them
* **code coverage analysis**: use zzuf to maximise code coverage

zzuf’s primary target is media players, image viewers and web browsers, because the data they process is inherently insecure, but it was also successfully used to find bugs in system utilities such as objdump.

zzuf is not rocket science: the idea of fuzzing input data is barely new, but zzuf’s main purpose is to make things easier and automated. You can see an old, impressive [list of bugs found with zzuf](/wiki/zzuf/bugs).

## Support

**Fully supported**: Linux (glibc), FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Mac OS X and OpenSolaris

**Almost working**: NetBSD

**Not ready**: Windows

## Downloads

Downloads happen on Github: [​https://github.com/samhocevar/zzuf/releases](https://github.com/samhocevar/zzuf/releases)

## Documentation

The `zzuf` tutorial is a hands-on guide to the most important `zzuf` features. It starts with the working principles but goes on with very advanced uses of the tool.

Warning: this tutorial requires `zzuf` version 0.11 or later.

### Presentations

Sam gave a few talks about zzuf. The slides contain information you may find useful:

* [​FOSDEM 2007](http://fosdem.org/2007/) (Sam actually missed that talk) - [PDF](/files/zzuf/zzuf-20070225.pdf) or [OpenOffice](/files/zzuf/zzuf-20070225.odp)
* [​Hacker Space Festival 2008](http://www.hackerspace.net/schedule) - [PDF](/files/zzuf/zzuf-20080621.pdf) or [OpenOffice](/files/zzuf/zzuf-20080621.odp)

### Internals documentation

zzuf is full of black magic and can be pretty difficult to hack with. The [internals documentation](/wiki/zzuf/internals) tries to shed light on the global architecture and some specific tricks.

## Development

Development happens on GitHub:

* [​https://github.com/samhocevar/zzuf](https://github.com/samhocevar/zzuf)

If you want to discuss zzuf or report bugs, you can use the GitHub issue tracker, or write to ​sam@hocevar.net, or even join #libcaca on irc.freenode.net.

## They use zzuf

* [​Goatse Security](http://security.goatse.fr/) uses zzuf to find issues in various third-party applications.
* Security researchers at [​Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/) use zzuf to stress test their applications and libraries.
* The [​CERT Basic Fuzzing Framework](http://www.cert.org/download/bff/) (BFF) is based on zzuf.

# How long does it take to fix a crash-bug?

[Hanno's Blog](https://blog.hboeck.de/)

#### [How long does it take to fix a crash-bug?](/archives/578-How-long-does-it-take-to-fix-a-crash-bug.html)

About one year ago, Sam Hocevar posted [some results on tests](http://sam.zoy.org/blog/2007-01-16-exposing-file-parsing-vulnerabilities) with his fuzzing tool [zzuf](http://sam.zoy.org/zzuf/), which showed a large number of crashes in various applications, especially multimedia apps.

Crash bugs on invalid input very often lead to security issues, thus this should be taken seriously.

Now, I took the freedom to have a look how many of the issues found back then were fixed. I used the most current versions in gentoo linux (testing/~x86-system), which tend to be quite up-to-date. I also cross-checked the crashes for other apps, as they often use the same or similar code.

Seems only vlc devs did their homework (Sam Hocevar is part of the vlc team). Interesting enough, even firefox seems to have a gif-crasher since a year.

gstreamer crash by lol-ffplay.mpg lol-gstreamer.m2v lol-mplayer.m2v lol-mplayer.mpg lol-vlc.m2v lol-vlc.mpg

Cite "I used the most current versions in gentoo linux (testing/~x86-system)" on the time of my writing.

mplayer 1.0\_rc2\_p24929-r2

xine-lib-1.1.9 (update to 1.1.9.1 is now available, but first tests don't show much changes)

gstreamer-0.10.15

firefox 2.0.0.11

Just tested those files, and the ones from the zuff page ... and nothing crashes here with latest cvs of all gstreamer + plugins.

If you get crashes, tell us on #gstreamer on irc.freenode.net or via the gstreamer bugzilla tracker (bugzilla.gnome.org Product:GStreamer)
