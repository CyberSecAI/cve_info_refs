Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2004-2731

    infamous41md reported multiple integer overflows in the Sbus PROM
    driver that would allow for a DoS (Denial of Service) attack by a
    local user, and possibly the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-4814

    Doug Chapman discovered a potential local DoS (deadlock) in the mincore
    function caused by improper lock handling.

CVE-2006-5753

    Eric Sandeen provided a fix for a local memory corruption vulnerability
    resulting from a misinterpretation of return values when operating on
    inodes which have been marked bad.

CVE-2006-5823

    LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted cramfs filesystem.

CVE-2006-6053

    LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted ext3 filesystem.

CVE-2006-6054

    LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted ext2 filesystem.

CVE-2006-6106

    Marcel Holtman discovered multiple buffer overflows in the Bluetooth
    subsystem which can be used to trigger a remote DoS (crash) and potentially
    execute arbitray code.

CVE-2007-1353

    Ilja van Sprundel discovered that kernel memory could be leaked via the
    Bluetooth setsockopt call due to an uninitialized stack buffer. This
    could be used by local attackers to read the contents of sensitive kernel
    memory.

CVE-2007-1592

    Masayuki Nakagawa discovered that flow labels were inadvertently
    being shared between listening sockets and child sockets. This defect
    can be exploited by local users to cause a DoS (Oops).

CVE-2007-2172

    Thomas Graf reported a typo in the DECnet protocol handler that could
    be used by a local attacker to overrun an array via crafted packets,
    potentially resulting in a Denial of Service (system crash).
    A similar issue exists in the IPV4 protocol handler and will be fixed
    in a subsequent update.

CVE-2007-2525

    Florian Zumbiehl discovered a memory leak in the PPPOE subsystem caused
    by releasing a socket before PPPIOCGCHAN is called upon it. This could
    be used by a local user to DoS a system by consuming all available memory.

CVE-2007-3848

    Wojciech Purczynski discovered that pdeath_signal was not being reset
    properly under certain conditions which may allow local users to gain
    privileges by sending arbitrary signals to suid binaries.

CVE-2007-4308

    Alan Cox reported an issue in the aacraid driver that allows unprivileged
    local users to make ioctl calls which should be restricted to admin
    privileges.

CVE-2007-4311

    PaX team discovered an issue in the random driver where a defect in the
    reseeding code leads to a reduction in entropy.

CVE-2007-5093

    Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam
    devices. If the device is removed while a userspace application has it
    open, the driver will wait for userspace to close the device, resulting
    in a blocked USB subsystem. This issue is of low security impact as
    it requires the attacker to either have physical access to the system
    or to convince a user with local access to remove the device on their
    behalf.

CVE-2007-6063

    Venustech AD-LAB discovered a a buffer overflow in the isdn ioctl
    handling, exploitable by a local user.

CVE-2007-6151

    ADLAB discovered a possible memory overrun in the ISDN subsystem that
    may permit a local user to overwrite kernel memory leading by issuing
    ioctls with unterminated data.

CVE-2007-6206

    Blake Frantz discovered that when a core file owned by a non-root user
    exists, and a root-owned process dumps core over it, the core file
    retains its original ownership. This could be used by a local user to
    gain access to sensitive information.

CVE-2007-6694

    Cyrill Gorcunov reported a NULL pointer dereference in code specific
    to the CHRP PowerPC platforms. Local users could exploit this issue
    to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS).

CVE-2008-0007

    Nick Piggin of SuSE discovered a number of issues in subsystems which
    register a fault handler for memory mapped areas. This issue can be
    exploited by local users to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS) and possibly
    execute arbitrary code.

The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                 Debian 3.1 (sarge)

We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

Note that this update changes various package names due to ABI changes.
You must therefore have the corresponding upgrade-assist metapackage(s)
installed for your upgrades to automatically take place. These packages
have names with the prefix 'kernel-image-2.4-'.

For a full list of the metapackages available for your architecture, run
the following command on the target Debian 3.1 system:
        apt-cache search kernel-image-2.4-

Any 3rd party modules that have been built and installed for your system
will need to be rebuilt and installed for compatability with the new ABI.

Debian 3.1 (oldstable)
- ----------------------

Oldstable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2006-5823

    LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted cramfs filesystem.

CVE-2006-6054

    LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted ext2 filesystem.

CVE-2006-6058

    LMH reported an issue in the minix filesystem that allows local users
    with mount privileges to create a DoS (printk flood) by mounting a
    specially crafted corrupt filesystem.

CVE-2006-7203

    OpenVZ Linux kernel team reported an issue in the smbfs filesystem which
    can be exploited by local users to cause a DoS (oops) during mount.

CVE-2007-1353

    Ilja van Sprundel discovered that kernel memory could be leaked via the
    Bluetooth setsockopt call due to an uninitialized stack buffer. This
    could be used by local attackers to read the contents of sensitive kernel
    memory.

CVE-2007-2172

    Thomas Graf reported a typo in the DECnet protocol handler that could
    be used by a local attacker to overrun an array via crafted packets,
    potentially resulting in a Denial of Service (system crash).
    A similar issue exists in the IPV4 protocol handler and will be fixed
    in a subsequent update.

CVE-2007-2525

    Florian Zumbiehl discovered a memory leak in the PPPOE subsystem caused
    by releasing a socket before PPPIOCGCHAN is called upon it. This could
    be used by a local user to DoS a system by consuming all available memory.

CVE-2007-3105

    The PaX Team discovered a potential buffer overflow in the random number
    generator which may permit local users to cause a denial of service or
    gain additional privileges. This issue is not believed to effect default
    Debian installations where only root has sufficient privileges to exploit
    it.

CVE-2007-3739

    Adam Litke reported a potential local denial of service (oops) on
    powerpc platforms resulting from unchecked VMA expansion into address
    space reserved for hugetlb pages.

CVE-2007-3740

    Steve French reported that CIFS filesystems with CAP_UNIX enabled
    were not honoring a process' umask which may lead to unintentinally
    relaxed permissions.

CVE-2007-3848

    Wojciech Purczynski discovered that pdeath_signal was not being reset
    properly under certain conditions which may allow local users to gain
    privileges by sending arbitrary signals to suid binaries.

CVE-2007-4133

    Hugh Dickins discovered a potential local DoS (panic) in hugetlbfs.
    A misconversion of hugetlb_vmtruncate_list to prio_tree may allow
    local users to trigger a BUG_ON() call in exit_mmap.

CVE-2007-4308

    Alan Cox reported an issue in the aacraid driver that allows unprivileged
    local users to make ioctl calls which should be restricted to admin
    privileges.

CVE-2007-4573

    Wojciech Purczynski discovered a vulnerability that can be exploited
    by a local user to obtain superuser privileges on x86_64 systems.
    This resulted from improper clearing of the high bits of registers
    during ia32 system call emulation. This vulnerability is relevant
    to the Debian amd64 port as well as users of the i386 port who run
    the amd64 linux-image flavour.

CVE-2007-5093

    Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam
    devices. If the device is removed while a userspace application has it
    open, the driver will wait for userspace to close the device, resulting
    in a blocked USB subsystem. This issue is of low security impact as
    it requires the attacker to either have physical access to the system
    or to convince a user with local access to remove the device on their
    behalf.

CVE-2007-6063

    Venustech AD-LAB discovered a a buffer overflow in the isdn ioctl
    handling, exploitable by a local user.

CVE-2007-6151

    ADLAB discovered a possible memory overrun in the ISDN subsystem that
    may permit a local user to overwrite kernel memory leading by issuing
    ioctls with unterminated data.

CVE-2007-6206

    Blake Frantz discovered that when a core file owned by a non-root user
    exists, and a root-owned process dumps core over it, the core file
    retains its original ownership. This could be used by a local user to
    gain access to sensitive information.

CVE-2007-6694

    Cyrill Gorcunov reported a NULL pointer dereference in code specific
    to the CHRP PowerPC platforms. Local users could exploit this issue
    to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS).

CVE-2008-0007

    Nick Piggin of SuSE discovered a number of issues in subsystems which
    register a fault handler for memory mapped areas. This issue can be
    exploited by local users to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS) and possibly
    execute arbitrary code.

The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                 Debian 3.1 (sarge)
     kernel-image-2.6.8-alpha    2.6.8-17sarge1
     kernel-image-2.6.8-amd64    2.6.8-17sarge1
     kernel-image-2.6.8-hppa     2.6.8-7sarge1
     kernel-image-2.6.8-i386     2.6.8-17sarge1
     kernel-image-2.6.8-ia64     2.6.8-15sarge1
     kernel-image-2.6.8-m68k     2.6.8-5sarge1
     kernel-image-2.6.8-s390     2.6.8-6sarge1
     kernel-image-2.6.8-sparc    2.6.8-16sarge1
     kernel-patch-powerpc-2.6.8  2.6.8-13sarge1
     fai-kernels                 1.9.1sarge8

We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=382161#c2)  Mark J. Cox    2007-11-14 11:29:26 UTC  ``` Roland said:  Vanilla 2.6.9 is not affected, but RHEL4 probably is.  It has backported the relevant changes from the later upstream code so it probably behaves like the vanilla upstream kernel does now.  RHEL5 is probably not affected.  It has the ptrace subsystem replaced such that I think this code path no longer involved in the cases that can trigger the problem.    ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=382161#c5)  Mark J. Cox    2007-11-14 11:38:25 UTC  ``` Roland wrote:  ....The original "if (p->state > TASK_STOPPED)" line predated the introduction of TASK_TRACED.  When written, it was a correct test for what we now write as "if (p->exit_state)".  The patch below is the minimal necessary change to restore the original sense of the test intended and correct the pathological behavior of this test case.  This seems like the right thing to put in right away.  (I tested it with the case you forwarded.)  That covers the "security" problem, such as it is.  (It doesn't seem really exploitable to me, since if you kill all the traced processes it still dies, no permanent leaks or anything.)  Later we can get into what the check is there for at all and clean that up right.....  --- [PATCH] wait_task_stopped: Check p->exit_state instead of TASK_TRACED  The original meaning of the old test (p->state > TASK_STOPPED) was "not dead", since it was before TASK_TRACED existed and before the state/exit_state split.  It was a wrong correction in commit 14bf01bb0599c89fc7f426d20353b76e12555308 to make this test for TASK_TRACED instead.  It should have been changed when TASK_TRACED was introducted and again when exit_state was introduced.

"The spin occurs inside sys_waitid (1696..1729) when called with the WNOWAIT option and a signal from a ptraced process to be waited upon; the syscall never exits, so depending on the kernel state, the effect can be anything from a process spinning to a full system hang."   ``` |  |

## Details

The minix filesystem did not properly validate certain filesystem

values. If a local attacker could trick the system into attempting

to mount a corrupted minix filesystem, the kernel could be made to

hang for long periods of time, resulting in a denial of service.

This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2006-6058](/security/CVE-2006-6058))

The signal handling on PowerPC systems using HTX allowed local users

to cause a denial of service via floating point corruption. This was

only vulnerable in Ubuntu 6.10 and 7.04. ([CVE-2007-3107](/security/CVE-2007-3107))

The Linux kernel did not properly validate the hop-by-hop IPv6

extended header. Remote attackers could send a crafted IPv6 packet

and cause a denial of service via kernel panic. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04. ([CVE-2007-4567](/security/CVE-2007-4567))

The JFFS2 filesystem with ACL support enabled did not properly store

permissions during inode creation and ACL setting. Local users could

possibly access restricted files after a remount. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-4849](/security/CVE-2007-4849))

Chris Evans discovered an issue with certain drivers that use the

ieee80211\_rx function. Remote attackers could send a crafted 802.11

frame and cause a denial of service via crash. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-4997](/security/CVE-2007-4997))

Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam

devices. A local user with physical access to the system could remove

the device while a userspace application had it open and cause the USB

subsystem to block. This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04.

([CVE-2007-5093](/security/CVE-2007-5093))

Scott James Remnant discovered a coding error in ptrace. Local users

could exploit this and cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop.

This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-5500](/security/CVE-2007-5500))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel could dereference a NULL

pointer when processing certain IPv4 TCP packets. A remote attacker

could send a crafted TCP ACK response and cause a denial of service

via crash. This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.10. ([CVE-2007-5501](/security/CVE-2007-5501))

Warren Togami discovered that the hrtimer subsystem did not properly

check for large relative timeouts. A local user could exploit this and

cause a denial of service via soft lockup. ([CVE-2007-5966](/security/CVE-2007-5966))

Venustech AD-LAB discovered a buffer overflow in the isdn net

subsystem. This issue is exploitable by local users via crafted input

to the isdn\_ioctl function. ([CVE-2007-6063](/security/CVE-2007-6063))

It was discovered that the isdn subsystem did not properly check for

NULL termination when performing ioctl handling. A local user could

exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-6151](/security/CVE-2007-6151))

Blake Frantz discovered that when a root process overwrote an existing

core file, the resulting core file retained the previous core file's

ownership. Local users could exploit this to gain access to sensitive

information. ([CVE-2007-6206](/security/CVE-2007-6206))

Hugh Dickins discovered the when using the tmpfs filesystem, under

rare circumstances, a kernel page may be improperly cleared. A local

user may be able to exploit this and read sensitive kernel data or

cause a denial of service via crash. ([CVE-2007-6417](/security/CVE-2007-6417))

Bill Roman discovered that the VFS subsystem did not properly check

access modes. A local user may be able to gain removal privileges on

directories. ([CVE-2008-0001](/security/CVE-2008-0001))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues and a bug in the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 kernel are now available.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

These updated kernel packages fix the following security issues:

A flaw was found in the virtual filesystem (VFS). A local unprivileged
user could truncate directories to which they had write permission; this
could render the contents of the directory inaccessible. (CVE-2008-0001,
Important)

A flaw was found in the implementation of ptrace. A local unprivileged user
could trigger this flaw and possibly cause a denial of service (system
hang). (CVE-2007-5500, Important)

A flaw was found in the way the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 kernel handled
page faults when a CPU used the NUMA method for accessing memory on Itanium
architectures. A local unprivileged user could trigger this flaw and cause
a denial of service (system panic). (CVE-2007-4130, Important)

A possible NULL pointer dereference was found in the chrp\_show\_cpuinfo
function when using the PowerPC architecture. This may have allowed a local
unprivileged user to cause a denial of service (crash).
(CVE-2007-6694, Moderate)

A flaw was found in the way core dump files were created. If a local user
can get a root-owned process to dump a core file into a directory, which
the user has write access to, they could gain read access to that core
file. This could potentially grant unauthorized access to sensitive
information. (CVE-2007-6206, Moderate)

Two buffer overflow flaws were found in the Linux kernel ISDN subsystem. A
local unprivileged user could use these flaws to cause a denial of
service. (CVE-2007-6063, CVE-2007-6151, Moderate)

As well, these updated packages fix the following bug:

* when moving volumes that contain multiple segments, and a mirror segment

is not the first in the mapping table, running the "pvmove /dev/[device]
/dev/[device]" command caused a kernel panic. A "kernel: Unable to handle
kernel paging request at virtual address [address]" error was logged by
syslog.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Package        : linux-2.6

Problem-Type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-6058 CVE-2007-5966 CVE-2007-6063 CVE-2007-6206
                 CVE-2007-6417

Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel
that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2006-6058

    LMH reported an issue in the minix filesystem that allows local users
    with mount privileges to create a DoS (printk flood) by mounting a
    specially crafted corrupt filesystem.

CVE-2007-5966

    Warren Togami discovered an issue in the hrtimer subsystem that allows
    a local user to cause a DoS (soft lockup) by requesting a timer sleep
    for a long period of time leading to an integer overflow.

CVE-2007-6063

    Venustech AD-LAB discovered a a buffer overflow in the isdn ioctl
    handling, exploitable by a local user.

CVE-2007-6206

    Blake Frantz discovered that when a core file owned by a non-root user
    exists, and a root-owned process dumps core over it, the core file
    retains its original ownership. This could be used by a local user to
    gain access to sensitive information.

CVE-2007-6417

    Hugh Dickins discovered an issue in the tmpfs filesystem where, under
    a rare circumstance, a kernel page maybe improperly cleared, leaking
    sensitive kernel memory to userspace or resulting in a DoS (crash).

These problems have been fixed in the stable distribution in version
2.6.18.dfsg.1-13etch6.

The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatability with or to take advantage of this update:

                                 Debian 4.0 (etch)
     fai-kernels                 1.17+etch.13etch6
     user-mode-linux             2.6.18-1um-2etch.13etch6

We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [linux-source-2.6.15](/security/cves?package=linux-source-2.6.15) -

## Details

The minix filesystem did not properly validate certain filesystem

values. If a local attacker could trick the system into attempting

to mount a corrupted minix filesystem, the kernel could be made to

hang for long periods of time, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2006-6058](/security/CVE-2006-6058))

Alexander Schulze discovered that the skge driver does not properly

use the spin\_lock and spin\_unlock functions. Remote attackers could

exploit this by sending a flood of network traffic and cause a denial

of service (crash). ([CVE-2006-7229](/security/CVE-2006-7229))

Hugh Dickins discovered that hugetlbfs performed certain prio\_tree

calculations using HPAGE\_SIZE instead of PAGE\_SIZE. A local user

could exploit this and cause a denial of service via kernel panic.

([CVE-2007-4133](/security/CVE-2007-4133))

Chris Evans discovered an issue with certain drivers that use the

ieee80211\_rx function. Remote attackers could send a crafted 802.11

frame and cause a denial of service via crash. ([CVE-2007-4997](/security/CVE-2007-4997))

Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam

devices. A local user with physical access to the system could remove

the device while a userspace application had it open and cause the USB

subsystem to block. ([CVE-2007-5093](/security/CVE-2007-5093))

Scott James Remnant discovered a coding error in ptrace. Local users

could exploit this and cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop.

([CVE-2007-5500](/security/CVE-2007-5500))

Venustech AD-LAB discovered a buffer overflow in the isdn net

subsystem. This issue is exploitable by local users via crafted input

to the isdn\_ioctl function. ([CVE-2007-6063](/security/CVE-2007-6063))

It was discovered that the isdn subsystem did not properly check for

NULL termination when performing ioctl handling. A local user could

exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-6151](/security/CVE-2007-6151))

Blake Frantz discovered that when a root process overwrote an existing

core file, the resulting core file retained the previous core file's

ownership. Local users could exploit this to gain access to sensitive

information. ([CVE-2007-6206](/security/CVE-2007-6206))

Hugh Dickins discovered the when using the tmpfs filesystem, under

rare circumstances, a kernel page may be improperly cleared. A local

user may be able to exploit this and read sensitive kernel data or

cause a denial of service via crash. ([CVE-2007-6417](/security/CVE-2007-6417))

Bill Roman discovered that the VFS subsystem did not properly check

access modes. A local user may be able to gain removal privileges

on directories. ([CVE-2008-0001](/security/CVE-2008-0001))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-386,

linux-powerpc, linux-amd64-generic), a standard system upgrade will

automatically perform this as well.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This kernel update fixes the following security problems:
- CVE-2007-3104: The sysfs\_readdir function in the Linux kernel 2.6
allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel OOPS)
by dereferencing a null pointer to an inode in a dentry.
- CVE-2007-4997: A 2 byte buffer underflow in the ieee80211 stack
was fixed, which might be used by attackers in the local WLAN reach
to crash the machine.
- CVE-2007-3740: The CIFS filesystem, when Unix extension support is
enabled, did not honor the umask of a process, which allowed local
users to gain privileges.
- CVE-2007-4573: It was possible for local user to become root by
exploiting a bug in the IA32 system call emulation. This problem
affects the x86\_64 platform only, on all distributions.
This problem was fixed for regular kernels, but had not been fixed
for the XEN kernels. This update fixes the problem also for the
XEN kernels.
- CVE-2007-4308: The (1) aac\_cfg\_open and (2) aac\_compat\_ioctl
functions in the SCSI layer ioctl path in aacraid did not check
permissions for ioctls, which might have allowed local users to
cause a denial of service or gain privileges.
- CVE-2007-3843: The Linux kernel checked the wrong global variable
for the CIFS sec mount option, which might allow remote attackers to
spoof CIFS network traffic that the client configured for security
signatures, as demonstrated by lack of signing despite sec=ntlmv2i
in a SetupAndX request.
- CVE-2007-5904: Multiple buffer overflows in CIFS VFS in the Linux
kernel allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
and possibly execute arbitrary code via long SMB responses that
trigger the overflows in the SendReceive function.
This requires the attacker to mis-present / replace a CIFS server
the client machine is connected to.
Also the exploitability of this problem is not known.
- CVE-2007-6063: Buffer overflow in the isdn\_net\_setcfg function in
isdn\_net.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to have an
unknown impact via a crafted argument to the isdn\_ioctl function.

2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=392101#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2007-11-20 12:50:18 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  The Linux kernel is prone to an buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is due to a design error in the 'isdn_net_setcfg()' function. There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in function isdn_net_setcfg().  At line 1413, in drivers/isdn/i4l/isdn_common.c the 'cfg' is read from user-space. so the 'cfg' is user-controlled. At line 1415, function isdn_net_setcfg() is invoked. The '&cfg' is passed to isdn_net_setcfg() as an argument.  At line 2805 in drivers/isdn/il4/isdn_net.c, function strcpy() is invoked. The size of argument lp->msn is 32 and cfg->eaz is 256. Because the data of '*cfg' is user-controlled (so cfg->eaz is user-controlled), it's possible to overrun  destination string lp->msn by string cfg->eaz. When the length of string 'cfg->eaz' is greater than 32, a buffer overflow will occur.  This issue is public via:  <http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9416>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=392101#c9)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2008-07-23 04:17:59 UTC  ``` Proposed upstream patch: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=0f13864e5b24d9cbe18d125d41bfa4b726a82e40>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=392101#c11)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2008-07-23 05:22:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 312419](attachment.cgi?id=312419&action=diff "Proposed backported patch for RHEL-3.9") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=312419&action=edit "Proposed backported patch for RHEL-3.9") Proposed backported patch for RHEL-3.9   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=392101#c12)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2008-07-23 05:46:18 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 312420](attachment.cgi?id=312420&action=diff "Proposed backported patch for RHEL-2.1") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=312420&action=edit "Proposed backported patch for RHEL-2.1") Proposed backported patch for RHEL-2.1   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

When the length of string 'cfg->eaz' is greater than 32,  a buffer overflow will occur.   III.CREDIT:  ----------     Venustech AD-LAB discovered this vuln. Thanks to all Venustech AD-Lab guys.

If you could file them under the appropriate category for the problem, or if in doubt under "Other/Other" rather than "Other/Bug Tracker", it'd help us out a lot. That category is for bugs against the bugzilla setup itself.  If you're in doubt of the owner, you can always assign them to "bugme-janitors@lists.osdl.org", but bugme-admin isn't a good choice.  Thanks, The Admins ;-) ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=9416#c2)  Ismail Donmez    2007-11-28 14:49:47 UTC  ``` Since this is assigned a CVE, I wonder if there is a fix for this planned for mainline? ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=9416#c3)  Karsten Keil    2007-11-29 08:21:52 UTC  ``` Patches are already submitted, and I think they are in Linus tree now, patches are under evaluation for the stable series. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=9416#c4)  Karsten Keil    2007-11-29 08:23:10 UTC  ``` So I think we can close this now. ``` |  |

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Linux kernel contained various security problems for which we
released updates.
This round of updates covers kernels for following product families:
- SUSE Linux Enterprise 10
- SUSE Linux 10.1
- openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
This kernel update fixes the following security problems:
CVE-2008-0007: Insufficient range checks in certain fault handlers
could be used by local attackers to potentially read or write kernel
memory. (all)
CVE-2008-0001: Incorrect access mode checks could be used by local
attackers to corrupt directory contents and so cause denial of service
attacks or potentially execute code. (all) Please note that this
problem does not affect SLES 9 or SLES 8.
CVE-2007-5966: Integer overflow in the hrtimer\_start function in
kernel/hrtimer.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.23.10 allows local
users to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (panic)
via a large relative timeout value. (all)
CVE-2007-3843: The Linux kernel checked the wrong global variable
for the CIFS sec mount option, which might allow remote attackers to
spoof CIFS network traffic that the client configured for security
signatures, as demonstrated by lack of signing despite sec=ntlmv2i
in a SetupAndX request. (openSUSE 10.2, 10.3)
CVE-2007-2242: The IPv6 protocol allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service via crafted IPv6 type 0 route headers
(IPV6\_RTHDR\_TYPE\_0) that create network amplification between two
routers. A non-kABI breaking patch has now been applied to all
product trees.
CVE-2007-6417: The shmem\_getpage function (mm/shmem.c) in Linux kernel
2.6.11 through 2.6.23 does not properly clear allocated memory in some
rare circumstances, which might allow local users to read sensitive
kernel data or cause a denial of service (crash). (all)
CVE-2007-4308: The (1) aac\_cfg\_open and (2) aac\_compat\_ioctl functions
in the SCSI layer ioctl path in aacraid in the Linux kernel did not
check permissions for ioctls, which might have allowed local users
to cause a denial of service or gain privileges. (openSUSE 10.2)
CVE-2007-3740: The CIFS filesystem, when Unix extension support is
enabled, does not honor the umask of a process, which allows local
users to gain privileges. (openSUSE 10.2)
CVE-2007-3848: The Linux kernel allowed local users to send
arbitrary signals to a child process that is running at higher
privileges by causing a setuid-root parent process to die, which
delivers an attacker-controlled parent process death signal
(PR\_SET\_PDEATHSIG). (openSUSE 10.2)
CVE-2007-4997: Integer underflow in the ieee80211\_rx function in
net/ieee80211/ieee80211\_rx.c in the Linux kernel allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted SKB length
value in a runt IEEE 802.11 frame when the IEEE80211\_STYPE\_QOS\_DATA
flag is set, aka an "off-by-two error." (openSUSE 10.2)
CVE-2007-6063: Buffer overflow in the isdn\_net\_setcfg function in
isdn\_net.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to have an unknown
impact via a crafted argument to the isdn\_ioctl function. (openSUSE
10.2)
A failed AppArmor change\_hat system call can result in an apparmored
task becoming unconfined (326546). (openSUSE 10.2)
Also quite a number of non-security bugs were fixed.
The openSUSE 10.3 kernel update was reissued twice, the second time
to fix a regression with CPU Frequency handling on Laptops.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Reboot the machine after the update was installed.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
