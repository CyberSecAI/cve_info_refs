netkit-ftpd/ftp uninitialized vulnerability
Class: Design Error
DATE:11/1/2007
CVEID:CVE-2007-5769
Vulnerable:
	netkit-ftpd-0.17/netkit-ftp-0.17
Vendor:

I.Synopsis

A vulnerability has been discovered in netkit-ftpd/ftp.

II.DETAILS:
----------
Background

netkit-ftpd is the Linux Netkit FTP server with optional SSL support.
netkit-ftp is the client for the ftp protocol.

Description

	There is a uninitialized  vulnerability in function dataconn() in ftpd.c.
 	static FILE * dataconn(const char *name, off_t size, const char *mode)
 	{
 		char sizebuf[[32]](#32);
 		FILE *file;  <-uninit variable.

		...
			 if (SSL_accept(ssl_data_con)<=0) {
1459 				static char errbuf[1024];
1460
1461 				snprintf(errbuf, sizeof(errbuf), "ftpd: SSL_accept DATA error
%s\n",
1462 					    ERR_error_string(ERR_get_error(),NULL));
1463 				perror_reply(425, errbuf);
1464 				/* abort time methinks ... */
1465 				fclose(file); <-- close an uninit value.
1466 				return NULL;

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x6fca33fd in fclose () from /lib/libc.so.6
(gdb) bt
#0  0x6fca33fd in fclose () from /lib/libc.so.6
#1  0x0804c601 in dataconn (name=0x77add110 "/bin/ls", size=<value
optimized out>, mode=0x8053f4f "w") at ftpd.c:1465
#2  0x0804d3f8 in retrieve (cmd=0x80550c7 "/bin/ls -lgA",

#3  0x0805193a in yyparse () at ftpcmd.y:378
) at ftpd.c:685

in order to trigger this bug, the client should use the passive mode to
transfer data.
and  the SSL_accept should  failed at line ftpd.c:1458. the client broke
the connection
will cause the SSL_accept failed.

same problem occur in netkit-ftp's getreply() too.
467     int
468     getreply(int expecteof)
469     {
........
520                                             (void)
signal(SIGINT,oldintr);
521                                             code = 221;
522                                             return (0);
523                                     }
524                                     lostpeer(0);
525                                     fclose(cout);

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

(gdb) bt
#0  0x6fcb73fd in fclose () from /lib/libc.so.6

#5  0x08055382 in main (argc=-817625725, argv=0xc3010805) at main.c:484

Impact
Reading uninitialized variables can result in unpredictable behavior,
crashes, or security holes.

# Netkit FTP Server: Denial of service — GLSA **200801-17**

Netkit FTP Server contains a Denial of Service vulnerability.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-ftp/netkit-ftpd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.17-r7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.17-r7** |

### Background

net-ftp/netkit-ftpd is the Linux Netkit FTP server with optional SSL
support.

### Description

Venustech AD-LAB discovered that an FTP client connected to a
vulnerable server with passive mode and SSL support can trigger an
fclose() function call on an uninitialized stream in ftpd.c.

### Impact

A remote attacker can send specially crafted FTP data to a server with
passive mode and SSL support, causing the ftpd daemon to crash.

### Workaround

Disable passive mode or SSL.

### Resolution

All Netkit FTP Server users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-ftp/netkit-ftpd-0.17-r7"
```
### References

* [CVE-2007-6263](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6263)

**Release date**

January 29, 2008

**Latest revision**

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
