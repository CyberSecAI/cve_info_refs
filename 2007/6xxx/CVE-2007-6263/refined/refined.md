{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an uninitialized `FILE` pointer in the `dataconn()` function within `ftpd.c` and in `getreply()` in `ftp.c`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Uninitialized variable",
        "Use of uninitialized pointer in fclose()"
      ],
      "impact": "The uninitialized pointer leads to a crash when `fclose()` is called, resulting in a denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "For the ftpd server, a remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by connecting to an ftpd server with passive mode and SSL support, causing the SSL handshake to fail which then causes an attempt to close the uninitialized file pointer.",
        "For the ftp client, the issue can be triggered during the `getreply()` function when a connection is lost.",
        "The client breaking the connection during the SSL handshake or a lost connection will cause a crash."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the ftp server and trigger a condition that results in the `SSL_accept` failing (for the server) or force a connection loss (for the client)."
    }
  ],
  "additional_notes": [
    "The issue affects both netkit-ftpd (server) and netkit-ftp (client).",
    "The client-side issue (CVE-2007-5769) is considered less severe as it only leads to a client crash, whereas the server-side issue (CVE-2007-6263) can lead to a service denial.",
      "The Gentoo bug report indicates that the patch for the ftp client issue introduced a similar problem."
