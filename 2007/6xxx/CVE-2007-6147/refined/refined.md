{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI). Multiple PHP files within the application improperly include external files by using user-controlled parameters.",

        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the vulnerable server, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
      "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL and specifying the malicious file in the `php_root_path` or `privilege_root_path` parameter, an attacker can force the vulnerable application to include and execute the remote file.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable application. They would also need to host a malicious PHP script on a webserver they control."
