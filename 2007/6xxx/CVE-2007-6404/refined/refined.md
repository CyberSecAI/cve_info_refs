Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2007-6404:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in inadequate input validation and sanitization within the Simple HTTPd server, specifically when handling file paths and script/CGI requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Directory Traversal:** The server fails to properly handle ".." sequences in the requested URL paths. This allows attackers to navigate outside the web root directory and access files located elsewhere on the server's file system.
2.  **Script/CGI Viewing/Downloading:** The server does not enforce proper execution of scripts or CGI files. By appending characters like '+', '.', '%20', '%2e', or any byte greater than 0x7f (in hex format) to the requested file name, an attacker can force the server to serve the file content instead of executing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Directory Traversal:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to download any file on the disk where the web root is located, leading to potential exposure of sensitive data, configuration files, and other critical information.
2.  **Script/CGI Viewing/Downloading:** Attackers can gain access to the source code of scripts and CGI applications, potentially revealing vulnerabilities, logic flaws, database credentials, and other sensitive information. This could further enable sophisticated attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors are remote, utilizing HTTP requests to the vulnerable Simple HTTPd server.

1.  **Directory Traversal:** Attackers can send crafted HTTP requests containing ".." sequences within the URL, e.g., `http://SERVER/..\..\..\boot.ini`. Encoded versions such as `http://SERVER/..\%2e%2e%5c..\boot.ini` are also effective.
2.  **Script/CGI Viewing/Downloading:** Attackers can send HTTP requests for script/CGI files and append specific characters to the filename, e.g., `http://SERVER/file.php+`, `http://SERVER/file.php.`, `http://SERVER/file.php%80`, or `http://SERVER/file.php%ff`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

Attackers must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No specific user account or privilege is required to exploit these vulnerabilities. The attacker only needs network access to the server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is noted to affect only Windows platforms.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Luigi Auriemma, with the '%20' character identified by Shay Priel.
*   The provided content includes proof-of-concept URLs that demonstrate both types of attacks.
*   The issue was reported to the shttpd mailing list, but no fix was available as of the time of writing the report.
