{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the `locks_remove_flock` function within the Linux kernel's locking mechanism. Specifically, the NFS client allows a user to leave behind posix locks by changing the file mode before unlocking. When the `locks_remove_flock` function tries to remove these locks during file closing, it encounters a lock that it expects to be already cleared, leading to a kernel BUG and system crash.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary vulnerability is an improper lock handling in the `locks_remove_flock` function and a bypass of mandatory locking checks in the NFS client. The NFS client prevents mandatory locking but an inconsistency in the code allows a user to change the mode and leave behind posix locks. This leads to a BUG when those locks are encountered during the closing of the file",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation results in a kernel panic and system crash, effectively causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. A local user can trigger this crash by manipulating file modes and leaving behind posix locks.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a local user manipulating file modes and posix locks on files mounted via NFS, specifically by setting the sgid bit but not the group execute bit.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have local user access to the system and have the ability to create and manipulate files on a mounted NFS share."
