{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a user-controlled parameter `path_escape` in a `require_once` statement without proper sanitization, leading to Remote File Inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a remote file, typically a malicious PHP script, and execute arbitrary code on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted request to `config.inc.php` with the `path_escape` parameter set to a URL pointing to the malicious script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges on the server or the application are required."
