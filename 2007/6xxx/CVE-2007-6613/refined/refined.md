      },
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is located in the print_iso9660_recurse function within the libcdio library. The issue arises due to an incorrect check of a 'b3_rock' enumeration which causes the code to enter the `iso9660_name_translate_ext` function, leading to a write beyond the end of the `translated_name` buffer, corrupting the stack.  The patch involves fixing the buffer size calculation, specifically related to handling filenames when Rock Ridge extensions are not present. Initially, a patch introduced an off-by-one error in size calculation; it was corrected later."
