How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Ruby on Rails: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200711-17**

Several vulnerabilities were found in Ruby on Rails allowing for file
disclosure and theft of user credentials.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-ruby/rails** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.5** |

### Background

Ruby on Rails is a free web framework used to develop database-driven
web applications.

### Description

candlerb found that ActiveResource, when processing responses using the
Hash.from\_xml() function, does not properly sanitize filenames
(CVE-2007-5380). The session management functionality allowed the
"session\_id" to be set in the URL (CVE-2007-5380). BCC discovered that
the to\_json() function does not properly sanitize input before
returning it to the user (CVE-2007-3227).

### Impact

Unauthenticated remote attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to
determine the existence of files or to read the contents of arbitrary
XML files; conduct session fixation attacks and gain unauthorized
access; and to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's
browser session in context of an affected site by enticing a user to
browse a specially crafted URL.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Ruby on Rails users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-ruby/rails-1.2.5"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Rajiv Aaron Manglani (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-10 01:45:13 UTC  ``` Security Enhancements  1.2.4 fixes several potential security issues:      * Session fixation attacks are mitigated by removing support for URL-based sessions     * Changed the JSON encoding algorithms to avoid otential XSS issues when using ActiveRecord::Base#to_json     * Potential Security and performance problems with XmlSimple have been fixed by disabling certain dangerous options by default.  -------------------------------  From: 	  michael@koziarski.com Subject: 	Ruby on Rails 1.2.4 Date: 	October 9, 2007 9:33:45 PM EDT To: 	  rubyonrails-security@googlegroups.com Reply-To: 	  rubyonrails-security@googlegroups.com   The release of Ruby on Rails 1.2.4 addresses some potential security issues, all users of earlier versions are advised to upgrade to 1.2.4:  The particular issues are:  # Potential Information Disclosure or DoS with Hash#from_xml  Maliciously crafted requests to a rails application could cause the XML parser to read files from the server's disk or the network.  1.2.4 removes this functionality entirely.  # Session Fixation attacks.  The session functionality in rails allowed users to provide their session_id in the URL as well as cookies.  The functionality could be exploited by a malicious user to obtain an authenticated session.  Users who rely on URL based sessions can re-enable them as follows:  config.action_controller.session_options[:session_secure] = true  --  Cheers  Koz ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Hans de Graaff   gentoo-dev Security  2007-10-10 05:37:02 UTC  ``` The JSON problem, although not mentioned in the security announcement, is being addressed in [bug #182223](show_bug.cgi?id=182223 "RESOLVED FIXED - dev-ruby/activesupport <= 1.4.2 \"to_json\" Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2007-3227)"). Rails 1.2.4 is already in the tree and if no regressions are found we'll ask for it to become stable this weekend. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Hans de Graaff   gentoo-dev Security  2007-10-11 05:47:25 UTC  ``` So it seems that Rails 1.2.5 is forthcoming shortly to address the problem with JSON encoding once more. I propose we wait until Rails 1.2.5 is out and stabilize that once it is in the tree. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Rajiv Aaron Manglani (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-12 16:56:29 UTC  ``` <http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/10/12/rails-1-2-5-maintenance-release>   From: DHH <david.heinemeier@gmail.com> To: "Ruby on Rails: Security" <rubyonrails-security@googlegroups.com> Date: Fri, 12 Oct 2007 16:50:53 -0000 Subject: Rails 1.2.5: Closes JSON XSS vulnerability Reply-To: rubyonrails-security@googlegroups.com   This release closes a JSON XSS vulnerability, fixes a couple of minor regressions introduced in 1.2.4, and backports a handful of features and fixes from the 2.0 preview release.  All users of Rails 1.2.4 or earlier are advised to upgrade to 1.2.5, though it isn't strictly necessary if you aren't working with JSON. For more information the JSON vulnerability, see CVE-2007-3227.   ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Hans de Graaff   gentoo-dev Security  2007-10-13 06:38:43 UTC  ``` Rails 1.2.5 and friends just got added to CVS. Since upstream in all its wisdom decided to also include a few features that are backported from the forthcoming 2.0 branch, I'd like to test this a bit more before we start to stable it. Let's aim for a call to stable this on Monday. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-15 23:52:30 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=195315#c4)) > ... I'd like to test this a bit more before we start to stable it. > Let's aim for a call to stable this on Monday.  Did you experience any regressions, is it ok to go? ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Hans de Graaff   gentoo-dev Security  2007-10-16 05:32:40 UTC  ``` We should be good to go. No reports of any issues and I've also not noticed any regressions or problems in my own tests.   Arches, please stabilize dev-ruby/rails-1.2.5 and its dependencies. Both Rails 1.2.4 and 1.2.5 contain security fixes compared to Rails 1.2.3-r1. The following packages need to be stabilized in this order to avoid dependency issues:  eselect-rails-0.10 (already stable on arches that have marked rails 1.2.3-r1 as stable) activesupport-1.4.4 activerecord-1.15.5 actionpack-1.13.5 actionmailer-1.3.5 actionwebservice-1.2.5 rails-1.2.5  Note that this bug supersedes [bug #177209](show_bug.cgi?id=177209 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - stabilize dev-ruby/rails-1.2.3-r1"), calling for the stabilization of rails-1.2.3-r1 ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Christian Faulhammer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-16 06:01:32 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 177209](show_bug.cgi?id=177209 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - stabilize dev-ruby/rails-1.2.3-r1") *** ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Christian Faulhammer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-16 06:13:16 UTC  ``` Of course it should be the other way round ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Christian Faulhammer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-16 06:13:33 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 177209](show_bug.cgi?id=177209 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - stabilize dev-ruby/rails-1.2.3-r1") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Hans de Graaff   gentoo-dev Security  2007-10-16 06:57:35 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 182223](show_bug.cgi?id=182223 "RESOLVED FIXED - dev-ruby/activesupport <= 1.4.2 \"to_json\" Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2007-3227)") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Christian Faulhammer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-16 07:16:56 UTC  ``` x86 stable ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Raúl Porcel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-16 13:31:01 UTC  ``` ia64/sparc stable ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Tobias Scherbaum (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-18 17:16:21 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Steve Dibb (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-21 15:24:36 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-21 15:42:34 UTC  ``` Proposing B3.

CVE-2007-5379:          Rails before 1.2.4, as used for Ruby on Rails, allows remote attackers          and ActiveResource servers to determine the existence of arbitrary          files and read arbitrary XML files via the Hash.from_xml          (Hash#from_xml) method, which uses XmlSimple (XML::Simple) unsafely,          as demonstrated by reading passwords from the Pidgin (Gaim)          .purple/accounts.xml file. CVE-2007-3227:          Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the to_json function in          Ruby on Rails before edge 9606 allows remote attackers to inject          arbitrary web script via the input values.  ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-21 17:48:04 UTC  ``` I tend to vote YES. ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-25 20:11:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=195315#c15)) > CVE-2007-5380: >          Session fixation vulnerability   perhaps...   > CVE-2007-5379: >          files and read arbitrary XML files via the Hash.from_xml >          (Hash#from_xml) method, which uses XmlSimple (XML::Simple) unsafely, >          as demonstrated by reading passwords from the Pidgin (Gaim)  mmm   > CVE-2007-3227: >          Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the to_json function in  non-persistent XSS, i would vote no for this CVE.

I would vote yes for this issue. XML might not be the dominant way to save configurations and passwords, but I would not call it uncommon, so reading those files could be quite a breach for users. ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-07 08:25:03 UTC  ``` voting yes too, glsa request filed. ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-14 21:23:23 UTC  ``` GLSA 200711-17 ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
