How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2006-5823

    LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted cramfs filesystem.

CVE-2006-6054

    LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted ext2 filesystem.

CVE-2006-6058

    LMH reported an issue in the minix filesystem that allows local users
    with mount privileges to create a DoS (printk flood) by mounting a
    specially crafted corrupt filesystem.

CVE-2006-7203

    OpenVZ Linux kernel team reported an issue in the smbfs filesystem which
    can be exploited by local users to cause a DoS (oops) during mount.

CVE-2007-1353

    Ilja van Sprundel discovered that kernel memory could be leaked via the
    Bluetooth setsockopt call due to an uninitialized stack buffer. This
    could be used by local attackers to read the contents of sensitive kernel
    memory.

CVE-2007-2172

    Thomas Graf reported a typo in the DECnet protocol handler that could
    be used by a local attacker to overrun an array via crafted packets,
    potentially resulting in a Denial of Service (system crash).
    A similar issue exists in the IPV4 protocol handler and will be fixed
    in a subsequent update.

CVE-2007-2525

    Florian Zumbiehl discovered a memory leak in the PPPOE subsystem caused
    by releasing a socket before PPPIOCGCHAN is called upon it. This could
    be used by a local user to DoS a system by consuming all available memory.

CVE-2007-3105

    The PaX Team discovered a potential buffer overflow in the random number
    generator which may permit local users to cause a denial of service or
    gain additional privileges. This issue is not believed to effect default
    Debian installations where only root has sufficient privileges to exploit
    it.

CVE-2007-3739

    Adam Litke reported a potential local denial of service (oops) on
    powerpc platforms resulting from unchecked VMA expansion into address
    space reserved for hugetlb pages.

CVE-2007-3740

    Steve French reported that CIFS filesystems with CAP_UNIX enabled
    were not honoring a process' umask which may lead to unintentinally
    relaxed permissions.

CVE-2007-3848

    Wojciech Purczynski discovered that pdeath_signal was not being reset
    properly under certain conditions which may allow local users to gain
    privileges by sending arbitrary signals to suid binaries.

CVE-2007-4133

    Hugh Dickins discovered a potential local DoS (panic) in hugetlbfs.
    A misconversion of hugetlb_vmtruncate_list to prio_tree may allow
    local users to trigger a BUG_ON() call in exit_mmap.

CVE-2007-4308

    Alan Cox reported an issue in the aacraid driver that allows unprivileged
    local users to make ioctl calls which should be restricted to admin
    privileges.

CVE-2007-4573

    Wojciech Purczynski discovered a vulnerability that can be exploited
    by a local user to obtain superuser privileges on x86_64 systems.
    This resulted from improper clearing of the high bits of registers
    during ia32 system call emulation. This vulnerability is relevant
    to the Debian amd64 port as well as users of the i386 port who run
    the amd64 linux-image flavour.

CVE-2007-5093

    Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam
    devices. If the device is removed while a userspace application has it
    open, the driver will wait for userspace to close the device, resulting
    in a blocked USB subsystem. This issue is of low security impact as
    it requires the attacker to either have physical access to the system
    or to convince a user with local access to remove the device on their
    behalf.

CVE-2007-6063

    Venustech AD-LAB discovered a a buffer overflow in the isdn ioctl
    handling, exploitable by a local user.

CVE-2007-6151

    ADLAB discovered a possible memory overrun in the ISDN subsystem that
    may permit a local user to overwrite kernel memory leading by issuing
    ioctls with unterminated data.

CVE-2007-6206

    Blake Frantz discovered that when a core file owned by a non-root user
    exists, and a root-owned process dumps core over it, the core file
    retains its original ownership. This could be used by a local user to
    gain access to sensitive information.

CVE-2007-6694

    Cyrill Gorcunov reported a NULL pointer dereference in code specific
    to the CHRP PowerPC platforms. Local users could exploit this issue
    to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS).

CVE-2008-0007

    Nick Piggin of SuSE discovered a number of issues in subsystems which
    register a fault handler for memory mapped areas. This issue can be
    exploited by local users to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS) and possibly
    execute arbitrary code.

The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                 Debian 3.1 (sarge)
     kernel-image-2.6.8-alpha    2.6.8-17sarge1
     kernel-image-2.6.8-amd64    2.6.8-17sarge1
     kernel-image-2.6.8-hppa     2.6.8-7sarge1
     kernel-image-2.6.8-i386     2.6.8-17sarge1
     kernel-image-2.6.8-ia64     2.6.8-15sarge1
     kernel-image-2.6.8-m68k     2.6.8-5sarge1
     kernel-image-2.6.8-s390     2.6.8-6sarge1

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

The minix filesystem did not properly validate certain filesystem values.

If a local attacker could trick the system into attempting to mount a

corrupted minix filesystem, the kernel could be made to hang for long

periods of time, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2006-6058](/security/CVE-2006-6058))

Certain calculations in the hugetlb code were not correct. A local

attacker could exploit this to cause a kernel panic, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2007-4133](/security/CVE-2007-4133))

Eric Sesterhenn and Victor Julien discovered that the hop-by-hop IPv6

extended header was not correctly validated. If a system was configured

for IPv6, a remote attacker could send a specially crafted IPv6 packet

and cause the kernel to panic, leading to a denial of service. This

was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04. ([CVE-2007-4567](/security/CVE-2007-4567))

Permissions were not correctly stored on JFFS2 ACLs. For systems using

ACLs on JFFS2, a local attacker may gain access to private files.

([CVE-2007-4849](/security/CVE-2007-4849))

Chris Evans discovered that the 802.11 network stack did not correctly

handle certain QOS frames. A remote attacker on the local wireless network

could send specially crafted packets that would panic the kernel, resulting

in a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-4997](/security/CVE-2007-4997))

The Philips USB Webcam driver did not correctly handle disconnects.

If a local attacker tricked another user into disconnecting a webcam

unsafely, the kernel could hang or consume CPU resources, leading to

a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-5093](/security/CVE-2007-5093))

Scott James Remnant discovered that the waitid function could be made

to hang the system. A local attacker could execute a specially crafted

program which would leave the system unresponsive, resulting in a denial

of service. ([CVE-2007-5500](/security/CVE-2007-5500))

Ilpo Järvinen discovered that it might be possible for the TCP stack

to panic the kernel when receiving a crafted ACK response. Only Ubuntu

7.10 contained the vulnerable code, and it is believed not to have

been exploitable. ([CVE-2007-5501](/security/CVE-2007-5501))

When mounting the same remote NFS share to separate local locations, the

first location's mount options would apply to all subsequent mounts of the

same NFS share. In some configurations, this could lead to incorrectly

configured permissions, allowing local users to gain additional access

to the mounted share. (<https://launchpad.net/bugs/164231>)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=306591#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2007-09-26 09:37:20 UTC  ``` Linux Kernel USB PWC Driver Local Denial Of Service Vulnerability         reported as fixed after 2.7.22.6          If a 'pwc' device is disconnected, and a userspace application         has the device opened, the USB subsystem will be blocked until         it's closed. This allows attackers to block the entire USB         subsystem from further use.  <http://git.kernel.org/gitweb.cgi?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=85237f202d46d55c1bffe0c5b1aa3ddc0f1dce4d>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=306591#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2007-09-26 09:40:38 UTC  ``` This is a low/none severity issue; in order to exploit this:  1. a local attacker needs to have the ability to open a connection to the webcam (which is not the default, only the console user or root would have permissions to open the connection to the usb port) 2. the attacker needs to convince someone to unplug the webcam  So this attack is only really feasible if the attacker is physically present at the console (in which case there are much easier ways to DoS the machine).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=306591#c3)  Red Hat Product Security    2009-06-16 06:45:59 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0275.html>   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0972.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

The minix filesystem did not properly validate certain filesystem

values. If a local attacker could trick the system into attempting

to mount a corrupted minix filesystem, the kernel could be made to

hang for long periods of time, resulting in a denial of service.

This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2006-6058](/security/CVE-2006-6058))

The signal handling on PowerPC systems using HTX allowed local users

to cause a denial of service via floating point corruption. This was

only vulnerable in Ubuntu 6.10 and 7.04. ([CVE-2007-3107](/security/CVE-2007-3107))

The Linux kernel did not properly validate the hop-by-hop IPv6

extended header. Remote attackers could send a crafted IPv6 packet

and cause a denial of service via kernel panic. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04. ([CVE-2007-4567](/security/CVE-2007-4567))

The JFFS2 filesystem with ACL support enabled did not properly store

permissions during inode creation and ACL setting. Local users could

possibly access restricted files after a remount. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-4849](/security/CVE-2007-4849))

Chris Evans discovered an issue with certain drivers that use the

ieee80211\_rx function. Remote attackers could send a crafted 802.11

frame and cause a denial of service via crash. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-4997](/security/CVE-2007-4997))

Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam

devices. A local user with physical access to the system could remove

the device while a userspace application had it open and cause the USB

subsystem to block. This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04.

([CVE-2007-5093](/security/CVE-2007-5093))

Scott James Remnant discovered a coding error in ptrace. Local users

could exploit this and cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop.

This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-5500](/security/CVE-2007-5500))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel could dereference a NULL

pointer when processing certain IPv4 TCP packets. A remote attacker

could send a crafted TCP ACK response and cause a denial of service

via crash. This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.10. ([CVE-2007-5501](/security/CVE-2007-5501))

Warren Togami discovered that the hrtimer subsystem did not properly

check for large relative timeouts. A local user could exploit this and

cause a denial of service via soft lockup. ([CVE-2007-5966](/security/CVE-2007-5966))

Venustech AD-LAB discovered a buffer overflow in the isdn net

subsystem. This issue is exploitable by local users via crafted input

to the isdn\_ioctl function. ([CVE-2007-6063](/security/CVE-2007-6063))

It was discovered that the isdn subsystem did not properly check for

NULL termination when performing ioctl handling. A local user could

exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-6151](/security/CVE-2007-6151))

Blake Frantz discovered that when a root process overwrote an existing

core file, the resulting core file retained the previous core file's

ownership. Local users could exploit this to gain access to sensitive

information. ([CVE-2007-6206](/security/CVE-2007-6206))

Hugh Dickins discovered the when using the tmpfs filesystem, under

rare circumstances, a kernel page may be improperly cleared. A local

user may be able to exploit this and read sensitive kernel data or

cause a denial of service via crash. ([CVE-2007-6417](/security/CVE-2007-6417))

Bill Roman discovered that the VFS subsystem did not properly check

access modes. A local user may be able to gain removal privileges on

directories. ([CVE-2008-0001](/security/CVE-2008-0001))

Hi,

I found an old Philips Askey VC010 webcam and attempted to get it
working on Linux (latest git, x86_64). It worked fine, I could view
the camera in mplayer. But, however, when I went to move the camera, I
unplugged it and forgot to close mplayer. I didn't notice, moved it,
plugged it back in and immediately Mplayer died and dropped a genaral
protection fault oops + stacktrace in the kernel log. I unplugged the
camera again, and the entire system froze, most likely a kernel panic.
I've reproduced this twice, however I haven't been able to get it to
occur when using mplayer from the command line (so that I can see what
happens when it freezes). I've uploaded the 2 dmesg logs here:

<http://www.alex-smith.me.uk/files/dmesg.log>
<http://www.alex-smith.me.uk/files/dmesg2.log>

and also my .config here:

<http://www.alex-smith.me.uk/files/config-2.6.23-rc5.txt>

The mplayer command I used:

mplayer -cache 128 -tv
driver=v4l:width=640:height=480:outfmt=i420:device=/dev/video1 -vc
rawi420 -vo xv tv://

Thanks,
Alex

# USN-578-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

14 February 2008

Linux kernel vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [linux-source-2.6.15](/security/cves?package=linux-source-2.6.15) -

## Details

The minix filesystem did not properly validate certain filesystem

values. If a local attacker could trick the system into attempting

to mount a corrupted minix filesystem, the kernel could be made to

hang for long periods of time, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2006-6058](/security/CVE-2006-6058))

Alexander Schulze discovered that the skge driver does not properly

use the spin\_lock and spin\_unlock functions. Remote attackers could

exploit this by sending a flood of network traffic and cause a denial

of service (crash). ([CVE-2006-7229](/security/CVE-2006-7229))

Hugh Dickins discovered that hugetlbfs performed certain prio\_tree

calculations using HPAGE\_SIZE instead of PAGE\_SIZE. A local user

could exploit this and cause a denial of service via kernel panic.

([CVE-2007-4133](/security/CVE-2007-4133))

Chris Evans discovered an issue with certain drivers that use the

ieee80211\_rx function. Remote attackers could send a crafted 802.11

frame and cause a denial of service via crash. ([CVE-2007-4997](/security/CVE-2007-4997))

Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam

devices. A local user with physical access to the system could remove

the device while a userspace application had it open and cause the USB

subsystem to block. ([CVE-2007-5093](/security/CVE-2007-5093))

Scott James Remnant discovered a coding error in ptrace. Local users

could exploit this and cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop.

([CVE-2007-5500](/security/CVE-2007-5500))

Venustech AD-LAB discovered a buffer overflow in the isdn net

subsystem. This issue is exploitable by local users via crafted input

to the isdn\_ioctl function. ([CVE-2007-6063](/security/CVE-2007-6063))

It was discovered that the isdn subsystem did not properly check for

NULL termination when performing ioctl handling. A local user could

exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-6151](/security/CVE-2007-6151))

Blake Frantz discovered that when a root process overwrote an existing

core file, the resulting core file retained the previous core file's

ownership. Local users could exploit this to gain access to sensitive

information. ([CVE-2007-6206](/security/CVE-2007-6206))

Hugh Dickins discovered the when using the tmpfs filesystem, under

rare circumstances, a kernel page may be improperly cleared. A local

user may be able to exploit this and read sensitive kernel data or

cause a denial of service via crash. ([CVE-2007-6417](/security/CVE-2007-6417))

Bill Roman discovered that the VFS subsystem did not properly check

access modes. A local user may be able to gain removal privileges

on directories. ([CVE-2008-0001](/security/CVE-2008-0001))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-386,

linux-powerpc, linux-amd64-generic), a standard system upgrade will

automatically perform this as well.

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0972)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that resolve several security issues and fix
various bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* a flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Direct-IO implementation. This

could have allowed a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2007-6716, Important)

* when running ptrace in 31-bit mode on an IBM S/390 or IBM System z

kernel, a local unprivileged user could cause a denial of service by
reading from or writing into a padding area in the user\_regs\_struct32
structure. (CVE-2008-1514, Important)

* the do\_truncate() and generic\_file\_splice\_write() functions did not clear

the setuid and setgid bits. This could have allowed a local unprivileged
user to obtain access to privileged information. (CVE-2008-4210, Important)

* Tobias Klein reported a missing check in the Linux kernel's Open Sound

System (OSS) implementation. This deficiency could have led to an
information leak. (CVE-2008-3272, Moderate)

* a potential denial of service attack was discovered in the Linux kernel's

PWC USB video driver. A local unprivileged user could have used this flaw
to bring the kernel USB subsystem into the busy-waiting state.
(CVE-2007-5093, Low)

* the ext2 and ext3 file systems code failed to properly handle corrupted

data structures, leading to a possible local denial of service issue when
read or write operations were performed. (CVE-2008-3528, Low)

In addition, these updated packages fix the following bugs:

* when using the CIFS "forcedirectio" option, appending to an open file on

a CIFS share resulted in that file being overwritten with the data to be
appended.

* a kernel panic occurred when a device with PCI ID 8086:10c8 was present

on a system with a loaded ixgbe driver.

* due to an aacraid driver regression, the kernel failed to boot when trying

to load the aacraid driver and printed the following error message:
"aac\_srb: aac\_fib\_send failed with status: 8195".

* due to an mpt driver regression, when RAID 1 was configured on Primergy

systems with an LSI SCSI IME 53C1020/1030 controller, the kernel panicked
during boot.

* the mpt driver produced a large number of extraneous debugging messages

when performing a "Host reset" operation.

* due to a regression in the sym driver, the kernel panicked when a SCSI

hot swap was performed using MCP18 hardware.

* all cores on a multi-core system now scale their frequencies in

accordance with the policy set by the system's CPU frequency governor.

* the netdump subsystem suffered from several stability issues. These are

addressed in this updated kernel.

* under certain conditions, the ext3 file system reported a negative count

of used blocks.

* reading /proc/self/mem incorrectly returned "Invalid argument" instead of

"input/output error" due to a regression.

* under certain conditions, the kernel panicked when a USB device was

removed while the system was busy accessing the device.

* a race condition in the kernel could have led to a kernel crash during

the creation of a new process.

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Users should upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2004-2731

    infamous41md reported multiple integer overflows in the Sbus PROM
    driver that would allow for a DoS (Denial of Service) attack by a
    local user, and possibly the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-4814

    Doug Chapman discovered a potential local DoS (deadlock) in the mincore
    function caused by improper lock handling.

CVE-2006-5753

    Eric Sandeen provided a fix for a local memory corruption vulnerability
    resulting from a misinterpretation of return values when operating on
    inodes which have been marked bad.

CVE-2006-5823

    LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted cramfs filesystem.

CVE-2006-6053

    LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted ext3 filesystem.

CVE-2006-6054

    LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted ext2 filesystem.

CVE-2006-6106

    Marcel Holtman discovered multiple buffer overflows in the Bluetooth
    subsystem which can be used to trigger a remote DoS (crash) and potentially
    execute arbitray code.

CVE-2007-1353

    Ilja van Sprundel discovered that kernel memory could be leaked via the
    Bluetooth setsockopt call due to an uninitialized stack buffer. This
    could be used by local attackers to read the contents of sensitive kernel
    memory.

CVE-2007-1592

    Masayuki Nakagawa discovered that flow labels were inadvertently
    being shared between listening sockets and child sockets. This defect
    can be exploited by local users to cause a DoS (Oops).

CVE-2007-2172

    Thomas Graf reported a typo in the DECnet protocol handler that could
    be used by a local attacker to overrun an array via crafted packets,
    potentially resulting in a Denial of Service (system crash).
    A similar issue exists in the IPV4 protocol handler and will be fixed
    in a subsequent update.

CVE-2007-2525

    Florian Zumbiehl discovered a memory leak in the PPPOE subsystem caused
    by releasing a socket before PPPIOCGCHAN is called upon it. This could
    be used by a local user to DoS a system by consuming all available memory.

CVE-2007-3848

    Wojciech Purczynski discovered that pdeath_signal was not being reset
    properly under certain conditions which may allow local users to gain
    privileges by sending arbitrary signals to suid binaries.

CVE-2007-4308

    Alan Cox reported an issue in the aacraid driver that allows unprivileged
    local users to make ioctl calls which should be restricted to admin
    privileges.

CVE-2007-4311

    PaX team discovered an issue in the random driver where a defect in the
    reseeding code leads to a reduction in entropy.

CVE-2007-5093

    Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam
    devices. If the device is removed while a userspace application has it
    open, the driver will wait for userspace to close the device, resulting
    in a blocked USB subsystem. This issue is of low security impact as
    it requires the attacker to either have physical access to the system
    or to convince a user with local access to remove the device on their
    behalf.

CVE-2007-6063

    Venustech AD-LAB discovered a a buffer overflow in the isdn ioctl
    handling, exploitable by a local user.

CVE-2007-6151

    ADLAB discovered a possible memory overrun in the ISDN subsystem that
    may permit a local user to overwrite kernel memory leading by issuing
    ioctls with unterminated data.

CVE-2007-6206

    Blake Frantz discovered that when a core file owned by a non-root user
    exists, and a root-owned process dumps core over it, the core file
    retains its original ownership. This could be used by a local user to
    gain access to sensitive information.

CVE-2007-6694

    Cyrill Gorcunov reported a NULL pointer dereference in code specific
    to the CHRP PowerPC platforms. Local users could exploit this issue
    to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS).

CVE-2008-0007

    Nick Piggin of SuSE discovered a number of issues in subsystems which
    register a fault handler for memory mapped areas. This issue can be
    exploited by local users to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS) and possibly
    execute arbitrary code.

The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                 Debian 3.1 (sarge)

We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

Note that this update changes various package names due to ABI changes.
You must therefore have the corresponding upgrade-assist metapackage(s)
installed for your upgrades to automatically take place. These packages
have names with the prefix 'kernel-image-2.4-'.

For a full list of the metapackages available for your architecture, run
the following command on the target Debian 3.1 system:
        apt-cache search kernel-image-2.4-

Any 3rd party modules that have been built and installed for your system
will need to be rebuilt and installed for compatability with the new ABI.

Debian 3.1 (oldstable)
- ----------------------

Oldstable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
