This line is quoted:

  include_once $this->var_dir.$var.'.php';

with this exploit:

  /patch/log.php?var=[http://localhost/shell.txt?](http://localhost/shell.txt)

First of all, $var_dir is defined to a constant path, so RFI doesn't
look possible.

Secondly, the include_once call is in a class definition, wrapped
within a foreach:

                foreach ($var_types as $var) {

which would overwrite $var.

And, this is within a read_mod() method that appears to be called with
uncontrollable data, but I'm not 100% clear on that.
