  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes files based on user-controlled input without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The `dir_ws` parameter in the `config.php` file is vulnerable to RFI.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a GET request to the vulnerable `config.php` file, and have a malicious file hosted on a server they control."
