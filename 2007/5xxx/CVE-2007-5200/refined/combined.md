How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=332401#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2007-10-15 13:50:58 UTC  ``` Hugin was reported to create temporary / debug files in unsafe manner.  During the optimizer run, it creates debug output file with pre-defined name: /tmp/hugin_debug_optim_results.txt .  If file was already created by other user, hugin gives an error message.  This problem can be abused by malicious local user to perform symlink attack against user running hugin, which will result in overwrite of arbitrary file writable by user running hugin with panorama optimizer output.  There does not seem to be any upstream patch at the moment.  Updated package was released for openSuSE, which resolves this problem by disabling creation of debug file.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=332401#c1)  Bruno Postle    2007-10-15 16:25:27 UTC  ``` There isn't an upstream patch because nobody at opensuse bothered to contact upstream before creating a CVE.  The fix however is a simple one-liner:    sed -i 's/define DEBUG_WRITE_OPTIM_OUTPUT$/undef DEBUG_WRITE_OPTIM_OUTPUT/' \   src/Panorama/PTOptimise.cpp  Though currently hugin isn't buildable for either f7 or f8 due to #295521 so this one is stucked.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=332401#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2007-10-16 07:21:55 UTC  ``` Yes, this is probably the easiest way to fix this.  However, upstream may want to develop other fix, which does not sacrifice some functionality (I'm not trying to say fix above is wrong ;).  According to comments in huginApp.cpp, there is some intention to fix temp file usage:    // FIXME, make secure against some symlink attacks    ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=332401#c3)  Bruno Postle    2007-10-24 20:00:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 236541](attachment.cgi?id=236541&action=diff "Patch to fix CVE-2007-5200") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=236541&action=edit "Patch to fix CVE-2007-5200") Patch to fix [CVE-2007-5200](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-5200)  This is the upstream patch to fix this and another similar bug.  Note that releasing a new hugin still depends on [bug #295521](show_bug.cgi?id=295521 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - -fno-strict-aliasing breaks hugin build")   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=332401#c4)  Lubomir Kundrak    2007-11-01 16:37:10 UTC  ``` This is well over a month and still not resolved. Do you need any help other than oneliner fix in rebuilding wxGTK?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=332401#c6)  Bruno Postle    2007-11-05 22:24:58 UTC  ``` The patch and updated hugin.spec files for FC-6, F-7, F-8 and devel are in CVS.

Thanks, there was no wxGTK release, is [bug #295521](show_bug.cgi?id=295521 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - -fno-strict-aliasing breaks hugin build") local to my system only?   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=332401#c10)  Lubomir Kundrak    2007-11-07 12:49:46 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=332401#c9))  > > I was able to successfully tag and build all affected branches. > Thanks, there was no wxGTK release, is [bug #295521](show_bug.cgi?id=295521 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - -fno-strict-aliasing breaks hugin build") local to my system only?  Huh, I even forgot about that :) Anyways, as you can see, the package built. That can mean that either some other build root change (gcc or whatever) solved that or it is really specific to your configuration. Which version do you run, are you completly up-to-date?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=332401#c11)  Bruno Postle    2007-11-07 21:07:49 UTC  ``` I am/was up to date, the system is x86_64.  I can switch between the two wxGTK packages and reproduce, though it looks like I need to try this in mock and update the bug report as necessary.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=332401#c12)  Fedora Update System    2007-11-09 23:38:54 UTC  ``` hugin-0.6.1-11.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
