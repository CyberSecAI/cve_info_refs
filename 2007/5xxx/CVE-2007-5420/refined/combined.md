3Com 3CRWER100-75 is a wireless cable/DSL router (widely used here, in
israel).
The router has a web management interface in it's port 80 (available from
inside the network).
When the administrator assign a virtual server to port 80 (In the management
web filled under the firewall tab) and the line is not checked, the router
can be remotely managed using any computer in the internet (out of the
internal network).
When the line is checked ? the outside message is TCP ERROR if there is no
server (if there is a web server ? it will display the web site).
This behavior is regardless the fact that the remote management set to off
(check for the state in the management web under: Advanced- Security-Remote
Administration).
The router details are:
3C number 3CRWER100-75
Software version 1.2.10ww
