The provided content describes a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability found in phpmyProfiler version 0.9.6b.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of `require_once` with a concatenated path in the file `include/plugin/block.t.php` on line 9.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability
- The `require_once` statement is using a variable `$pmp_rel_path` which is concatenated with a relative path which is potentially controllable by an attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can include a remote file into the application.
- This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker could manipulate the `$pmp_rel_path` variable to include a file from a remote server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the value of the `$pmp_rel_path` variable. This could happen due to flaws in how this variable is initialized, processed, or passed in the application.
- The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
