{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'IsisScript' parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Disclosure: An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the 'IsisScript' parameter to include directory traversal sequences.",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): An attacker can inject arbitrary client-side script by providing a crafted 'IsisScript' parameter."
   ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local File Disclosure: An attacker can gain access to sensitive information stored on the server, such as configuration files, password files etc.\n Cross-Site Scripting: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, phishing, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET requests to a vulnerable CGI script ('wxis.exe').",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
