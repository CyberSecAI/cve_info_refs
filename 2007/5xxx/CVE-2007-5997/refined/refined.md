- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `campaign_stats.php` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass authentication and gain access to the admin username and password stored in the database by injecting SQL code into the `id` parameter of the vulnerable script. This then allows the attacker to log into the admin panel.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is exposed through the web interface via the `campaign_stats.php` script, specifically through the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server where the vulnerable application is hosted, and should have a user account to access the vulnerable area.
