How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1408-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
November 21, 2007                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : kdegraphics
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-5393

Alin Rad Pop discovered a buffer overflow in kpdf, which could allow
the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed PDF file is displayed.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:3.5.5-3etch2. Builds for arm and sparc are not yet available.

The old stable distribution (sarge) will be fixed later.

We recommend that you upgrade your kdegraphics packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch
- -------------------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CSTeX: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200711-34**

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in CSTeX, possibly allowing to
execute arbitrary code or overwrite arbitrary files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/cstetex** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.2-r2** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

CSTeX is a TeX distribution with Czech and Slovak support. It is used
for creating and manipulating LaTeX documents.

### Description

Multiple issues were found in the teTeX 2 codebase that CSTeX builds
upon (GLSA 200709-17, GLSA 200711-26). CSTeX also includes vulnerable
code from the GD library (GLSA 200708-05), from Xpdf (GLSA 200709-12,
GLSA 200711-22) and from T1Lib (GLSA 200710-12).

### Impact

Remote attackers could possibly execute arbitrary code and local
attackers could possibly overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges
of the user running CSTeX via multiple vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

CSTeX is not maintained upstream, so the package was masked in Portage.
We recommend that users unmerge CSTeX:

```
 # emerge --unmerge app-text/cstetex
```

As an alternative, users should upgrade their systems to use teTeX or
TeX Live with its Babel packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1537-1                security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                         Devin Carraway
April 02, 2008                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : xpdf
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-4352 CVE-2007-5392 CVE-2007-5393

Alin Rad Pop (Secunia) discovered a number of vulnerabilities in xpdf, a set
of tools for display and conversion of Portable Document Format (PDF) files.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
three problems:

CVE-2007-4352

    Inadequate DCT stream validation allows an attacker to corrupt
    memory and potentially execute arbitrary code by supplying a
    maliciously crafted PDF file.

CVE-2007-5392

    An integer overflow vulnerability in DCT stream handling could
    allow an attacker to overflow a heap buffer, enabling the execution
    of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-5393

    A buffer overflow vulnerability in xpdf's CCITT image compression
    handlers allows overflow on the heap, allowing an attacker to
    execute arbitrary code by supplying a maliciously crafted
    CCITTFaxDecode filter.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.01-9.1+etch2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.02-1.3.

We recommend that you upgrade your xpdf packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch
- -------------------------------

Stable updates are available for amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

# PTeX: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200805-13**

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in PTeX, possibly allowing the
execution of arbitrary code or overwriting arbitrary files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/ptex** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.1.10\_p20071203** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.1.10\_p20071203** |

### Background

PTeX is a TeX distribution with Japanese support. It is used for
creating and manipulating LaTeX documents.

### Description

Multiple issues were found in the teTeX 2 codebase that PTeX builds
upon (GLSA 200709-17, GLSA 200711-26). PTeX also includes vulnerable
code from the GD library (GLSA 200708-05), from Xpdf (GLSA 200709-12,
GLSA 200711-22) and from T1Lib (GLSA 200710-12).

### Impact

Remote attackers could possibly execute arbitrary code and local
attackers could possibly overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges
of the user running PTeX via multiple vectors, e.g. enticing users to
open specially crafted files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PTeX users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/ptex-3.1.10_p20071203"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : koffice
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-4352 CVE-2007-5392 CVE-2007-5393
Debian Bug     : 450631

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in xpdf code that is
embedded in koffice, an integrated office suite for KDE.  These flaws
could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by inducing the user
to import a specially crafted PDF document.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2007-4352

Array index error in the DCTStream::readProgressiveDataUnit method in
xpdf/Stream.cc in Xpdf 3.02pl1, as used in poppler, teTeX, KDE, KOffice,
CUPS, and other products, allows remote attackers to trigger memory
corruption and execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file.

CVE-2007-5392

Integer overflow in the DCTStream::reset method in xpdf/Stream.cc in
Xpdf 3.02p11 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
crafted PDF file, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow.

CVE-2007-5393

Heap-based buffer overflow in the CCITTFaxStream::lookChar method in
xpdf/Stream.cc in Xpdf 3.02p11 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a PDF file that contains a crafted CCITTFaxDecode
filter.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version
1:1.6.1-2etch2.

Updates for the old stable distribution (sarge), will be made available
as soon as possible.

We recommend that you upgrade your koffice package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

cups security update (RHSA-2007-1023)

Original Release Date: November 19, 2007

Last Revised: November 19, 2007

Number: ASA-2007-476

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer
for UNIX(R) operating systems.

A flaw was discovered in the handling of PDF files. An attacker
could create a malicious PDF file that would cause CUPS to crash or
potentially execute arbitrary code when printed. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2007-5393](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5393) to this issue.

A flaw was discovered in the way CUPS handles certain IPP tags.
A remote attacker who is able to connect to the IPP TCP port could send a
malicious request causing the CUPS daemon to crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2007-4351](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4351) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way CUPS handled SSL negotiation. A remote attacker
capable of connecting to the CUPS daemon could cause CUPS to crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2007-4045](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4045) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-1023.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with cups installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya AES | 3.1.3 | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable versions of
cups, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat Linux.

[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Poppler, KDE: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200711-22**

Poppler and various KDE components are vulnerable to multiple memory
management issues possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/poppler** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.6.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.6.1-r1** |

| Package | **kde-base/kpdf** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.5.8-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **3.5.7-r3**>= **3.5.8-r1** |

| Package | **kde-base/kdegraphics** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.5.8-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **3.5.7-r3**>= **3.5.8-r1** |

| Package | **app-office/kword** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.3-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.6.3-r2** |

| Package | **app-office/koffice** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.3-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.6.3-r2** |

### Background

Poppler is a cross-platform PDF rendering library originally based on
Xpdf. KOffice is an integrated office suite for KDE. KWord is the
KOffice word processor. KPDF is a KDE-based PDF viewer included in the
kdegraphics package.

### Description

Alin Rad Pop (Secunia Research) discovered several vulnerabilities in
the "Stream.cc" file of Xpdf: An integer overflow in the
DCTStream::reset() method and a boundary error in the
CCITTFaxStream::lookChar() method, both leading to heap-based buffer
overflows (CVE-2007-5392, CVE-2007-5393). He also discovered a boundary
checking error in the DCTStream::readProgressiveDataUnit() method
causing memory corruption (CVE-2007-4352). Note: Gentoo's version of
Xpdf is patched to use the Poppler library, so the update to Poppler
will also fix Xpdf.

### Impact

By enticing a user to view or process a specially crafted PDF file with
KWord or KPDF or a Poppler-based program such as Gentoo's viewers Xpdf,
ePDFView, and Evince or the CUPS printing system, a remote attacker
could cause an overflow, potentially resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Poppler users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/poppler-0.6.1-r1"
```

All KPDF users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kpdf-3.5.7-r3"
```

All KDE Graphics Libraries users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kdegraphics-3.5.7-r3"
```

All KWord users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/kword-1.6.3-r2"
```

All KOffice users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/koffice-1.6.3-r2"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

New poppler packages are available for Slackware 12.0 and -current.  New koffice packages are available for Slackware 11.0, 12.0, and -current.  New kdegraphics packages are available for Slackware 10.2, 11.0, 12.0, and -current.  These updated packages address similar bugs which could be used to crash applications linked with poppler or that use code from xpdf through the use of a malformed PDF document.  It is possible that a maliciously crafted document could cause code to be executed in the context of the user running the application processing the PDF.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1480-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff

Package        : poppler
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-4352 CVE-2007-5392 CVE-2007-5393

Alin Rad Pop discovered several buffer overflows in the Poppler PDF
library, which could allow the execution of arbitrary code if a
malformed PDF file is opened.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.4.5-5.1etch2.

The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain poppler.

We recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian 4.0 (stable)
- -------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.
