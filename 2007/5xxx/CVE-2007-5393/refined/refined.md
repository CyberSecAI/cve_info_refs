Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-5393:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   - Multiple sources (Novell, Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Secunia, KDE, Gentoo) confirm that CVE-2007-5393 is related to a boundary check error in the xpdf's CCITT image compression handlers which can lead to a heap buffer overflow.

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**
  - The root cause of this vulnerability lies in a boundary check error within the `CCITTFaxStream::lookChar` function in the `Stream.cc` file of the xpdf library.  This error could allow attackers to overwrite a heap buffer.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**
   - A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation could lead to:
     - A denial-of-service (application crash).
     - The execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user viewing the PDF file.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - A specially crafted PDF file containing a malicious CCITTFaxDecode filter.
   - The user must be tricked into opening or processing the malicious PDF file.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker must create and distribute a malicious PDF file.
   - The attacker does not require any specific network position or special system access to trigger the vulnerability. However, the attacker has to induce a user to open a malicious PDF file.

**Additional notes:**
 - The vulnerability stems from the xpdf library which is used by multiple applications including poppler (which itself is used by applications like kpdf, evince), koffice and cups.
 - Several advisories mention that the vulnerabilities were found by Secunia Research.
 - The fix for this vulnerability involves updating the affected packages to patched versions.
 - The descriptions provided give a clearer picture than the brief description in the CVE record
