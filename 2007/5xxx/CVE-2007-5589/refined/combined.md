How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 1403-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                            Thijs Kinkhorst

Package        : phpmyadmin
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitising
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-5589 CVE-2007-5386

Omer Singer of the DigiTrust Group discovered several vulnerabilities in
phpMyAdmin, an application to administrate MySQL over the WWW. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-5589

    phpMyAdmin allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script
    or HTML in the context of a logged in user's session (cross site
    scripting).

CVE-2007-5386

    phpMyAdmin, when accessed by a browser that does not URL-encode
    requests, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script
    or HTML via the query string.

For the old stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4:2.6.2-3sarge6.

For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 4:2.9.1.1-6.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4:2.11.1.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- sarg buffer overflow
The SQUID logfile analyzer sarg was updated to fix a buffer overflow
that can occur while handling untrusted log data. (CVE-2008-1167)
sarg was updated on SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- phpMyAdmin multiple XSS problems
phpMyAdmin was updated to fix multiple cross-site-scripting
vulnerabilities (CVE-2007-6100, CVE-2007-5589).
phpMyAdmin was updated on SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- xine FLAC security issues
The multimedia framework xine was updated to fix a possible buffer
overflow that can be triggered via FLAC tags to execute arbitrary
code (CVE-2008-0486) and a possible buffer overflow in the matroska
demuxer (CVE-2008-1161).
All Xine versions on our products have been updated.
- bind 1 byte overflow
Certain input data could trigger a buffer overflow in the
'inet\_network' function of libbind.
Applications that use this function could therefore potentially be
crashed or exploited to execute arbitrary code.
The Bind server itself is not affected (CVE-2008-0122).
- dbus-1 policy application problem
The message bus dbus-1 was updated to fix a vulnerability caused by
applying the policies incorrectly. (CVE-2008-0595)
dbus-1 was updated on all distributions.
- silc-toolkit buffer overflow
silc-toolkit was updated to fix a stack-based buffer overflow in
the silc\_fingerprint() function which can possibly be exploited to
execute arbitrary code remotely. (CVE-2008-1227)
silc-toolkit is included only in openSUSE 10.3 and was fixed there.
- boost regular expression problems
Certain regular expressions could cause the boost library to crash
(CVE-2008-0171, CVE-2008-0172).
boost was updated for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE Linux 10.1,
and openSUSE 10.2, 10.3. Older products are not affected.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
