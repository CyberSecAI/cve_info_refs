Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-5589:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a missing input sanitization in phpMyAdmin, specifically affecting the `server_status.php` page. This allows for the injection of malicious web scripts.
*   Additionally, the vulnerability also affected how phpMyAdmin handled `PHP_SELF`, `PATH_INFO`, and `REQUEST_URI`, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of XSS vulnerabilities. These allow an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML into a user's session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary web script or HTML in the context of a logged-in user's session.
*   This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Defacement
    *   Redirection to malicious websites

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`server_status.php`:** The advisory specifically mentions that the vulnerability can be triggered on the `server_status.php` page.
*   **`PHP_SELF`, `PATH_INFO`, `REQUEST_URI`**: These variables can also be manipulated to inject XSS payloads.
*   **Query String:**  The vulnerability can be triggered via the query string if the browser does not URL-encode requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, not requiring local access to the server.
*   **Targeted User Interaction:** The attack requires a logged-in user to interact with the vulnerable page, either directly or indirectly through a crafted link.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that "probably all versions before 2.11.1.2" are affected.
*   The vulnerability is considered "serious".
*   The fix involves upgrading to phpMyAdmin version 2.11.1.2 or newer.
*   The advisory provides links to the commit that fixes this issue.
*   The issue was discovered by Omer Singer of The DigiTrust Group.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) and CWE-661.
*   Red Hat Bugzilla also notes the fix for this CVE.
*   Debian Security Advisory DSA 1403-1 also addresses this CVE, along with CVE-2007-5386.
*   openSUSE also fixed the vulnerability in a security summary.

**In Summary:** The vulnerability is a classic XSS issue stemming from insufficient input sanitization in phpMyAdmin, making it possible for remote attackers to inject malicious code into the application and potentially compromise user sessions.
