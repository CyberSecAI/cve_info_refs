Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-5079

**Root Cause:**
The `gdm` (GNOME Display Manager) on x86_64 systems was not compiled and linked with `tcp_wrappers` library. This was due to a missing `libwrap.a` in `/usr/lib` directory (which is used in 32 bit systems, not 64 bit ones), and a missing `BuildRequires` for `tcp_wrappers` in the build configuration. As a result, `gdm` failed to use `tcp_wrappers` to control XDMCP connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   `gdm` ignores `tcp_wrappers` on x86_64 systems, failing to restrict XDMCP connections based on the `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny` configurations.
-   The build process for `gdm` was flawed on x86_64 platforms, preventing it from using the `tcp_wrappers` library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   Unauthorized remote access to the system via XDMCP is possible, bypassing access controls.
-   A malicious actor from outside the allowed network could gain control of the graphical user interface of the system, and by extension, the system itself.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   Network-based attacks using XDMCP.
-   An attacker needs to send XDMCP requests to the vulnerable `gdm` service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be on a network that has connectivity to the vulnerable system.
-   No specific user privileges on the target system are required beyond the ability to send network traffic to it.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was initially reported on Red Hat AS4 (Advanced Server 4) x86_64, but was confirmed to affect other versions.
- The bug report shows that RHEL3 was also affected, while RHEL5 and Fedora might be affected as well, but for a different reason.
- The fix involves recompiling `gdm` with `tcp_wrappers` enabled.
- The bug report mentions that the issue is considered by some to be a feature issue rather than a security issue, but it was addressed in a security update eventually.
