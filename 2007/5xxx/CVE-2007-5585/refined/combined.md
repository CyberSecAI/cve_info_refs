| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c0)  Patrick C. F. Ernzer    2007-10-17 15:54:17 UTC  ``` Description of problem: xscreensaver has started crashing a few days ago  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): xscreensaver-5.03-10.fc7.src.rpm  How reproducible: sometimes  Steps to Reproduce: 1. lock screen 2. leave computer 3. come back and wiggle mouse if screen dark    Actual results: screen unlocked without entering password  Expected results: screen remains locked until I enter my password  Additional info: output of "xscreensaver -sync -verbose -no-capture" will be attached. stupidly enough I forgot to up the ulimit -c from 0. it's running in sync and verbose mode again after "ulimit -c 2048". Will update this BZ if it craps out again.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c1)  Patrick C. F.

Ernzer    2007-10-18 12:32:42 UTC  ``` in reply to [Comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c5) oh, sorry, fixed now.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c7)  Mamoru TASAKA    2007-10-18 13:28:01 UTC  ``` I guess you don't have xscreensaver-gl-extras installed and rss-glx-xscreensaver installed, right?  In this case, the crash can be reproduced to me on rawhide.  If so, would you check if your crash still occur even if you have xscreensaver-gl-extras (more precisely,  the binary /usr/bin/xscreensaver-gl-helper ) installed?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c8)  Mamoru TASAKA    2007-10-18 14:28:32 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c7)) > I guess you don't have xscreensaver-gl-extras installed > and rss-glx-xscreensaver installed, right?   To avoid confusion, I wanted to say that I guess you don't have xscreensaver-gl-extras installed but you have rss-glx-xscreensaver (and rss-glx) installed.    ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c9)  Mamoru TASAKA    2007-10-18 14:38:01 UTC  ``` Also: if my guess is correct (i.e. you don't have xscreensaver-gl-extras installed), when you - make it sure that you have xscreensaver-base, rss-glx, rss-glx-xscreensaver   installed - remove xscreensaver-extras  - launch xscreensaver - type "xscreensaver-command -lock" as login user - and try to unlock then you probably get crash more frequently.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c10)  Patrick C. F. Ernzer    2007-10-18 15:53:58 UTC  ``` In reply to comments #7 and #8: $ rpm -q xscreensaver-gl-extras rss-glx-xscreensaver xscreensaver-base rss-glx rss-glx-xscreensaver package xscreensaver-gl-extras is not installed rss-glx-xscreensaver-0.8.1.p-11.fc7 xscreensaver-base-5.03-10.fc7 rss-glx-0.8.1.p-11.fc7 rss-glx-xscreensaver-0.8.1.p-11.fc7    In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c9): removed xscreensaver-extras and was able to reproduce the crash 3 times in a row with "xscreensaver-command -lock"  I have now added xscreensaver-gl-extras to my system (but xscreensaver-extras is still left off) will see if it crashes in the nwxt few days.)  Do I understand correctly from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c8) that the rss-glx-xscreensaver RPM should have a dependency on xscreensaver-gl-extras ?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c11)  Mamoru TASAKA    2007-10-18 16:07:38 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c10)) > Do I understand correctly from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c8) that the rss-glx-xscreensaver RPM > should have a dependency on xscreensaver-gl-extras ? I have to have a discussion with Nils.  Hello, Nils: It seems that GL hacks makes xscreensaver crash when xscreensaver is locked and the user tries to type a password to unlock the display, when /usr/bin/xscreensaver-gl-helper is not available. So rss-glx-xscreensaver should require /usr/bin/xscreensaver-gl-helper.  Then: - simply adding "Requires: xscreensaver-gl-extras" to   rss-glx-xscreensaver is preferable? Where I dislike this is that   rss-glx-xscreensaver does not actually need the whole   xscreensaver-gl-extras, only gl helper is needed. - or I will create xscreensaver-gl-base subpackage. move gl helper   to xscreensaver-gl-base and make rss-glx-xscreensaver require   xscreensaver-gl-base?   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c12)  Nils Philippsen    2007-10-19 07:42:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c11)) > (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c10)) > > Do I understand correctly from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c8) that the rss-glx-xscreensaver RPM > > should have a dependency on xscreensaver-gl-extras ? > I have to have a discussion with Nils. >  > Hello, Nils: > It seems that GL hacks makes xscreensaver crash when xscreensaver is > locked and the user tries to type a password to unlock the display, > when /usr/bin/xscreensaver-gl-helper is not available. > So rss-glx-xscreensaver should require /usr/bin/xscreensaver-gl-helper. >  > Then: > - simply adding "Requires: xscreensaver-gl-extras" to >   rss-glx-xscreensaver is preferable?

While "Require: /usr/bin/xscreensaver-gl-helper" would be the cleanest thing to do in rss-glx-xscreensaver, I like to avoid dependencies on files as they're potentially expensive at the dependency solving stage in yum. The next cleanest thing would be a split off helper binary and a requirement on that package ("Requires: xscreensaver-gl-base"). I agree that requiring the whole of xscreensaver-gl-extras is a bit over the top.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c13)  Mamoru TASAKA    2007-10-19 08:15:39 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c12)) > I like to avoid dependencies on files as they're > potentially expensive at the dependency solving stage in yum.  I agree.  > The next cleanest > thing would be a split off helper binary and a requirement on that package > ("Requires: xscreensaver-gl-base").  Okay. Then I will create a new "xscreensaver-gl-base" subpackage and split off "/usr/bin/xscrensaver-gl-helper" (and its man file) to xscreensaver-gl-base.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c14)  Mamoru TASAKA    2007-10-19 08:25:56 UTC  ``` Well, it seems that now ACL is now blocked for mass F-8 branching. <https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2007-October/msg01465.html>  I will commit the change (for xscreensaver) when CVS is again open, rebuild, then I will notice on this bug.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c15)  Mamoru TASAKA    2007-10-19 08:45:31 UTC  ``` Hello, Ian:  Now we decided that packages which contain xscreensaver GL hacks should require xscreensaver-gl-base (xscreensaver-gl-base will be created in xscreensaver 5.03-12). So tempest-xscreensaver should also have "Requires; xscreensaver-gl-base". Also, conf file in tempest-xscreensaver had a copy-and-paste typo which has to be fixed.  I uploaded a new tempest srpm on <http://mtasaka.fedorapeople.org/Bugfix/tempest-0-0.3.20070929.fc8.src.rpm>  Would you rebuild this srpm on devel, F-8 and F-7 once CVS is unlocked again?   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c16)  Mamoru TASAKA    2007-10-19 12:19:54 UTC  ``` 5.03-12.fc{7,8} now rebuilt.  <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=21635> <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=21636>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c17)  Mamoru TASAKA    2007-10-19 13:32:30 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c15)) > Hello, Ian:   > I uploaded a new tempest srpm on > <http://mtasaka.fedorapeople.org/Bugfix/tempest-0-0.3.20070929.fc8.src.rpm> >  > Would you rebuild this srpm on devel, F-8 and F-7 > once CVS is unlocked again?  Well, this srpm again has a mistake... For tempest I will submit a new CVS commit for this bug by myself, so please don't worry, Ian.     ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c18)  Mamoru TASAKA    2007-10-19 14:45:28 UTC  ``` tempest also done.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c19)  Nils Philippsen    2007-10-19 15:45:56 UTC  ``` rss-glx-0.8.1.p-15.fc{7,8} now built:  <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=21646> <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=21643>  Mamoru, will you push the F7 and F8(*) packages through Bodhi together?

Once rel-eng team accepted for F-8, I will request a new update for F-7 on bodhi as security ("as security" means that testing repo is skipped).     ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=336331#c21)  Lubomir Kundrak    2007-10-19 17:38:05 UTC  ``` The CVE Identifier for this issue has been requested.
