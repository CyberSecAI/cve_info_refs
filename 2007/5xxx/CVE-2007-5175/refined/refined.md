Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-5175

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in the `base.php` file of actSite version 1.991 Beta.
- It stems from the insecure handling of the `BaseCfg[BaseDir]` parameter within the `base.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes a file from a remote server specified by the attacker. This is due to the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `BaseCfg[BaseDir]` parameter in `lib/base.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote files on the vulnerable server. This allows them to:
    - **Execute arbitrary code:** By including a file containing malicious code, the attacker can gain complete control of the server.
    - **Data Theft:** The attacker could potentially access sensitive data, including databases.
    - **Defacement:** The attacker could alter the content of the website.
    - **Malware Installation:** The attacker can install malware on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable through a web browser.
- The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `base.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable actSite installation.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code resides in the `lib/base.php` file.
- The attacker controls the value of `$BaseCfg[BaseDir]`.
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP request with a URL similar to `http://[site]/[path]/lib/base.php?BaseCfg[BaseDir]=[shell]` where `[shell]` is the URL to the malicious file.

**Solution:**
- Upgrade to actSite version 1.995 or a later patched version.
