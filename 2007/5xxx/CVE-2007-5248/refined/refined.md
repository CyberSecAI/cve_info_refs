  "CVE-2007-5248": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The function responsible for displaying strings in the game console is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Format string vulnerability.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server. The vulnerability allows for complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the server.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted UDP packets to the server, specifically Punkbuster packets PB_Y and PB_U.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to a vulnerable server. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Doom 3 engine console's string visualization function is vulnerable to format string attacks due to insufficient sanitization of input strings.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Format string vulnerability.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution on the server, leading to complete compromise of the system.",
      "Attack vectors": "Abuse of Punkbuster anti-cheat system, where specific packets (PB_Y and PB_U) cause the game console to display attacker-controlled strings.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker can send a single UDP packet to a server with Punkbuster enabled."
