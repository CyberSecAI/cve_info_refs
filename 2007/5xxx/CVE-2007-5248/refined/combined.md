===============
1) Introduction
===============
The Doom 3 engine (formerly known as id Tech 4) is the latest version
of the famous game engine developed by ID Software
(http://www.idsoftware.com) and used in some recent games:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id\_Tech\_4
#######################################################################
======
2) Bug
======
The function which visualizes the strings on the game's console is
vulnerable to a format string vulnerability, something similar to
snprintf(buff, 1024, string);
Usually this is not a problem since the engine uses some functions and
tricks to avoid the visualization of the % char like dropping it or
inserting a space between it and the subsequent char.
But there is a way for bypassing this limitation with also the better
advantages of doing it anonymously and with only one single spoofable
UDP packet: Punkbuster.
When Punkbuster is active on a server (practically almost all the
public servers) it visualizes the content of some incoming packets
using the game's console.
The Punkbuster packets needed for forcing the visualization of a custom
string in the console are PB\_Y (YPG server) and PB\_U (UCON), while in
the past was ok to use PB\_P too which has been recently made no longer
verbose probably due to its abusing attempted by people for spamming
servers (which is naturally still possible with the above packets).
As already said this is a bug in the Doom 3 engine and affects both
dedicated and non-dedicated servers, so NOT a Punkbuster's bug which
is used only as a "way" for reaching a zone of the code otherwise
unexploitable.
#######################################################################

3) The Code
===========
http://aluigi.org/poc/d3engfspb.zip
#######################################################################
======
4) Fix
======
No fix.
No reply from the developers.
UPDATE 4 Oct 2007
Punkbuster has released a new version of the anti-cheat which filters
the % char passed to the vulnerable function used in the Doom 3 engine
for visualizing the strings in the console.
This prevents the exploitation of the bug via Punkbuster.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

===============
1) Introduction
===============
The Doom 3 engine (formerly known as id Tech 4) is the latest version
of the famous game engine developed by ID Software
(http://www.idsoftware.com) and used in some recent games:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id\_Tech\_4
#######################################################################
======
2) Bug
======
The function which visualizes the strings on the game's console is
vulnerable to a format string vulnerability, something similar to
snprintf(buff, 1024, string);
Usually this is not a problem since the engine uses some functions and
tricks to avoid the visualization of the % char like dropping it or
inserting a space between it and the subsequent char.
But there is a way for bypassing this limitation with also the better
advantages of doing it anonymously and with only one single spoofable
UDP packet: Punkbuster.
When Punkbuster is active on a server (practically almost all the
public servers) it visualizes the content of some incoming packets
using the game's console.
The Punkbuster packets needed for forcing the visualization of a custom
string in the console are PB\_Y (YPG server) and PB\_U (UCON), while in
the past was ok to use PB\_P too which has been recently made no longer
verbose probably due to its abusing attempted by people for spamming
servers (which is naturally still possible with the above packets).
As already said this is a bug in the Doom 3 engine and affects both
dedicated and non-dedicated servers, so NOT a Punkbuster's bug which
is used only as a "way" for reaching a zone of the code otherwise
unexploitable.
