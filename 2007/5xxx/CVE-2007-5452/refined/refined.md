```
[1] Blind SQL Injection in php-stats.recjs.php:

  - Root cause: Improper input validation of the 'ip' parameter in `php-stats.recjs.php`. The script uses `long2ip()` which converts a numeric argument to a dotted IPv4 address. However, it does not properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code through a specially crafted numeric value (e.g., -1' OR 1=1/* ).
  - Weaknesses:  SQL injection vulnerability due to lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input ('ip' parameter).
  - Impact: Allows an attacker to read sensitive data from the database, such as admin password hashes via blind SQL injection.
  - Attack vectors: By manipulating the 'ip' parameter in the GET request to `php-stats.recjs.php`.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to send crafted GET requests to the vulnerable `php-stats.recjs.php` file.

[2] Remote Code Execution in admin.php (and other files):

  - Root cause: The application uses `eval()` function to execute code stored in the database ('php-stats-options' option), specifically when `$NowritableServer` is set to 1.
  - Weaknesses:  Use of `eval()` with unsanitized user input, allows injection of arbitrary PHP code.
  - Impact: An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to complete server compromise.
  - Attack vectors: 
    - The attacker can set the `$NowritableServer` variable through the admin panel.
    -  They can inject malicious PHP code into the `php-stats-options` setting via the backup restore function in the admin panel.
    - Then, by visiting any page that executes the vulnerable code (e.g., admin.php), they can trigger the execution of the injected code.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Requires admin privileges to modify the settings.
