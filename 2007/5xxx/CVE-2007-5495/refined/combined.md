| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=288221#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2007-09-12 18:48:53 UTC  ``` reported via secalert           By default, the sealert program writes diagnostic messages to the file /tmp/sealert.log. It does not check to ensure that this file does not already exist, or that it is not a symbolic link. An unprivileged local attacker can exploit this flaw to cause arbitrary files writable by other users to be overwritten when those users run sealert. The sealert program is run automatically, without user action, as part of the default RHEL 5 GNOME desktop session. It does not appear to be possible for the attacker to cause arbitrary data to be written to sealert.log, but the previous contents of the file are erased.'   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=288221#c1)  John Dennis    2007-09-13 16:47:20 UTC  ``` This is already addressed in the current upstream, the file is no longer created.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=288221#c2)  Steve Grubb    2007-09-13 19:02:43 UTC  ``` What about RHEL5.1's version?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=288221#c3)  John Dennis    2007-09-14 22:35:46 UTC  ``` The RHEL 5.1 version is the same as 5.0. It would be trival to patch RHEL to turn off creation of this log file.  The only way for security sensitive information to be written to the file would be if the verbose debug logging was turned on, but that requires root privledge to modify the configuration. Tracebacks due to program exceptions which might be written to the file do not contain user data.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=288221#c7)  Mark J. Cox    2008-05-21 14:17:39 UTC  ``` removing embargo   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=288221#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2008-05-25 18:33:57 UTC  ``` John, can you please clarify which upstream setroubleshoot version first fixed this flaw?  I see /tmp/sealert.log defined in config.py in 1.8.11 and is no longer set in 1.9.4, but I fail to find versions in between to check which version was the first to include this change.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=288221#c9)  John Dennis    2008-05-27 15:20:49 UTC  ``` No, I don't recall the exact version this first appeared in. If it's important I could research it.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=288221#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2008-05-27 16:03:08 UTC  ``` Probably not if you agree with the assessment that fix occurred somewhere in between 1.8.11 and 1.9.4, so that I managed to identify the right change that was used to resolve this issue.  Is there any place where all previous upstream versions can be found?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=288221#c11)  Red Hat Product Security    2008-05-29 07:52:44 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0061.html>     ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
