{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple buffer overflows and insecure temporary file creation in the dviljk and dvips programs, triggered by specially crafted DVI files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflows due to insufficient bounds checking when handling strings and arrays.",
      "Use of insecure temporary file creation functions like tmpnam().",
	  "Lack of proper input validation of specially crafted DVI files"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running dviljk or dvips. Additionally, a local attacker could exploit the insecure temporary file creation vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files via symlink attack.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted DVI file via dviljk or dvips",
	  "Exploiting the insecure temporary file creation with a symlink attack."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious DVI file. If exploited remotely, the victim must be enticed to open or process this file with dviljk or dvips. For exploiting the temp file vulnerability a local user account is needed."
