1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- rsync heap overflow in xattr code
A remotely exploitable heap overflow in rsync's xattr code has
been fixed. CVE-2008-1720 has been assigned to this issue.
rsync was fixed on openSUSE 10.3.
- MozillaFirefox 2.0.0.14 security release
Mozilla Firefox was brought to security update version 2.0.0.14.
Following security problems were fixed:
- MFSA 2008-20/CVE-2008-1380: Fixes for security problems in the
JavaScript engine described in MFSA 2008-15 (CVE-2008-1237) introduced
a stability problem, where some users experienced frequent crashes
during JavaScript garbage collection. These crashes may be exploitable
if someone finds a reliable way to trigger the crash.
We were not able to reproduce the crashes internally. Updates have been
released on SLE 10, SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- poppler PDF problems
Specially crafted PDF files with embedded fonts could potentially be
abused to trick applications that process PDF files into executing
arbitrary code (CVE-2008-1693).
Fixes for poppler for all distributions containing poppler have
been released.
- nagios cross site scripting problems
Several cross site scripting (XSS) issues in nagios were fixed
(CVE-2007-5624, CVE-2007-5803, CVE-2008-1360).
SLE 10, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 received fixed nagios packages.
- lighttpd SSL denial of service
The web server lighttpd had a problem, where an error in one
SSL connection could lead to termination of all SSL connections
(CVE-2008-1531)
This problem has been fixed in SLE 10, SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE
10.2 and 10.3.
- sarg various buffer overflows
Multiple stack buffer overflows have been fixed in the Squid logfile
analyzer sarg. (CVE-2008-1922)
sarg updates have been released for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2
and 10.3.
- squid denial of service fix
A flaw in a previous security update could cause squid to crash
under certain circumstances (CVE-2008-1612).
squid was updated on all distributions.
- bzip2 decoder denial of service
Specially crafted files could crash the bzip2-decoder
(CVE-2008-1372).
bzip2 was updated on all distributions.
- kdelibs3 unix signal handling
Start\_kdeinit did not handle unix signals the right way
(CVE-2008-1671)
This was only a problem in openSUSE 10.3 and fixed there.
- texlive-bin dvips overflows
Buffer overflows in dvips and dviljk could be triggered by specially
crafted dvi files (CVE-2007-5935, CVE-2007-5937). dvips additionally
created temporary files in an insecure manner (CVE-2007-5936).
Only openSUSE 10.3 updates were missing for this issue, the others
were released several weeks ago already.
- kdelibs4 heap overflow in PNG loader of KHTML
A heap overflow in the PNG loader of KHTML has been
fixed. CVE-2008-1670 has been assigned to this issue.
Only openSUSE 10.3 was affected and fixed.
- Sun Java 1.6.0 u6 security update
Sun Java was updated to 1.6.0u6 to fix several bugs and potentially
also security problems.
Sun has however not published any details regarding Security
Vulnerabilities in this update.
Only openSUSE 10.3 contains Sun Java 1.6.0 and was fixed.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

# PTeX: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200805-13**

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in PTeX, possibly allowing the
execution of arbitrary code or overwriting arbitrary files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/ptex** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.1.10\_p20071203** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.1.10\_p20071203** |

### Background

PTeX is a TeX distribution with Japanese support. It is used for
creating and manipulating LaTeX documents.

### Description

Multiple issues were found in the teTeX 2 codebase that PTeX builds
upon (GLSA 200709-17, GLSA 200711-26). PTeX also includes vulnerable
code from the GD library (GLSA 200708-05), from Xpdf (GLSA 200709-12,
GLSA 200711-22) and from T1Lib (GLSA 200710-12).

### Impact

Remote attackers could possibly execute arbitrary code and local
attackers could possibly overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges
of the user running PTeX via multiple vectors, e.g. enticing users to
open specially crafted files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PTeX users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/ptex-3.1.10_p20071203"
```

# T1Lib: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200710-12**

T1Lib is vulnerable to a buffer overflow allowing for the user-assisted
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/t1lib** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.0.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.0.2-r1** |

### Background

T1Lib is a library for rasterizing bitmaps from Adobe Type 1 fonts.

### Description

Hamid Ebadi discovered a boundary error in the
intT1\_EnvGetCompletePath() function which can lead to a buffer overflow
when processing an overly long filename.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a font file with a
specially crafted filename, possibly leading to the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application
using T1Lib.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All T1Lib users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/t1lib-5.0.2-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

+
+ \* dvi2xx.c (DoSpecial): Security issue: usage of tmpnam() caused
+ tempfile race condition. I use mkdtemp() if it's available and
+ fall back to tmpnam.
+
+ Special parsing of include files was inconsistent, unify it. The
+ current parsing code still allows lots of non-sensical special
+ commands, but at least it doesn't access unrelated variables any
+ more.
+
+2007-06-28 Joachim Schrod
+
+ \* dvi2xx.c: Fixed a whole bunch of buffer overflows: The program
+ did not check memory bounds for any string operation. All places
+ where strings are copied with strcpy are replaced by dynamically
+ allocated strings (with xstrdup from kpathsea) or bounded string
+ operations. Fixed also manual string copy operations on special
+ strings. Fixed array buffer overflow in defpoint and fill special
+ operations.
+ (DoSpecial): Call of ghostscript for psfile special had also a
+ potential buffer overflow caused by unchecked usage of sprintf.
+ Fix core dump: Check if all required parameters of psfile special
+ are passed.
+
+ Bumped version number up to 2.6p3.
+
+ \* dvi2xx.h: Some fixed sized string arrays are pointers now, they
+ get dynamically allocated.
+ (GetBytes): Another buffer overflow: Check that the buffer size is
+ sufficient to store the read bytes. That relies on the invariant
+ that the GetBytes macro is always called with an array as argument
+ and not with a pointer.
+
+ \* config.h: Throw an error if kpathsea is not used. dvi2xx.c
+ had previously already kpathsea dependencies without protecting
+ them with #if KPATHSEA. We go that road further since upstream
+ does not exist any more.

# Poppler, KDE: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200711-22**

Poppler and various KDE components are vulnerable to multiple memory
management issues possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/poppler** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.6.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.6.1-r1** |

| Package | **kde-base/kpdf** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.5.8-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **3.5.7-r3**>= **3.5.8-r1** |

| Package | **kde-base/kdegraphics** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.5.8-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **3.5.7-r3**>= **3.5.8-r1** |

| Package | **app-office/kword** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.3-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.6.3-r2** |

| Package | **app-office/koffice** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.3-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.6.3-r2** |

### Background

Poppler is a cross-platform PDF rendering library originally based on
Xpdf. KOffice is an integrated office suite for KDE. KWord is the
KOffice word processor. KPDF is a KDE-based PDF viewer included in the
kdegraphics package.

### Description

Alin Rad Pop (Secunia Research) discovered several vulnerabilities in
the "Stream.cc" file of Xpdf: An integer overflow in the
DCTStream::reset() method and a boundary error in the
CCITTFaxStream::lookChar() method, both leading to heap-based buffer
overflows (CVE-2007-5392, CVE-2007-5393). He also discovered a boundary
checking error in the DCTStream::readProgressiveDataUnit() method
causing memory corruption (CVE-2007-4352). Note: Gentoo's version of
Xpdf is patched to use the Poppler library, so the update to Poppler
will also fix Xpdf.

### Impact

By enticing a user to view or process a specially crafted PDF file with
KWord or KPDF or a Poppler-based program such as Gentoo's viewers Xpdf,
ePDFView, and Evince or the CUPS printing system, a remote attacker
could cause an overflow, potentially resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Poppler users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/poppler-0.6.1-r1"
```

All KPDF users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kpdf-3.5.7-r3"
```

All KDE Graphics Libraries users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kdegraphics-3.5.7-r3"
```

All KWord users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/kword-1.6.3-r2"
```

All KOffice users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/koffice-1.6.3-r2"
```

# CSTeX: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200711-34**

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in CSTeX, possibly allowing to
execute arbitrary code or overwrite arbitrary files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/cstetex** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.2-r2** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

CSTeX is a TeX distribution with Czech and Slovak support. It is used
for creating and manipulating LaTeX documents.

### Description

Multiple issues were found in the teTeX 2 codebase that CSTeX builds
upon (GLSA 200709-17, GLSA 200711-26). CSTeX also includes vulnerable
code from the GD library (GLSA 200708-05), from Xpdf (GLSA 200709-12,
GLSA 200711-22) and from T1Lib (GLSA 200710-12).

### Impact

Remote attackers could possibly execute arbitrary code and local
attackers could possibly overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges
of the user running CSTeX via multiple vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

CSTeX is not maintained upstream, so the package was masked in Portage.
We recommend that users unmerge CSTeX:

```
 # emerge --unmerge app-text/cstetex
```

As an alternative, users should upgrade their systems to use teTeX or
TeX Live with its Babel packages.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- libexiv2 integer overflow problem
Meder Kydyraliev of Google found out that specially crafted
files could trigger an integer overflow in the libexiv2 library,
potentially causing code execution (CVE-2007-6353).
This problem affected openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3, updated packages were
released on December 21st.
- dvips buffer overflows / insecure tempfiles
Buffer overflows in dvips and dviljk could be triggered by specially
crafted dvi files (CVE-2007-5935, CVE-2007-5937).
dvips additionally created temporary files in an insecure manner
(CVE-2007-5936).
Update TeX packages have been released for all affected distributions
except openSUSE 10.3. openSUSE 10.3 texlive packages are still pending
due to unrelated problems.
- libsndfile possible buffer overflow
A possible buffer overflow that occurs while reading decoded PCM
data from the FLAC library was fixed in libsndfile. (CVE-2007-4974)
Updates have been released for all affected distributions containing
libsndfile on January 3rd.
- squid denial of service problem
The web browser squid was updated to fix a denial-of-service bug
during cache update reply processing. (CVE-2007-6239)
Squid has been updated on all SUSE Linux based products on
December 30.
- rsync directory traversal problems
A bug in rsync was fixed that allowed remote attackers to access
restricted files outside a module's hierarchy if no chroot setup
was used. (CVE-2007-6199)
Please also read <http://rsync.samba.org/security.html> entry
from November 28th, 2007 to get more information about a secure
configuration of rsync that also covers the bug tracked with
CVE-2007-6200.
This rsync update also fixes some crashes that only affect rsync-2.6.8
on SLES10.
The update was released on December 22nd.
- clamav 0.92 security update
The virus scan engine clamav was upgrade to 0.92 to fix numerous flaws including
some security problems (CVE-2007-6335, CVE-2007-6336, CVE-2007-6337).
Please note that the version number of the clamav library has
changed. Programs linked against libclamav therefore need to be
updated as well. We released klamav, claws and sylpheed-claws packages to
adjust this.
This update was released on December 20.
- Xen denial of service problems
Various Xen issues have been fixed, two of them security related:
- CVE-2007-5906: Xen allowed virtual guest system users to cause
a denial of service (hypervisor crash) by using a debug register
(DR7) to set certain breakpoints.
- CVE-2007-5907: Xen 3.1.1 does not prevent modification of the CR4
TSC from applications, which allows pv guests to cause a denial
of service (crash).
Updates have been released for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.3 and SUSE
Linux Enterprise Server 10. openSUSE 10.2 updates are still pending.

2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
- libexif vulnerabilities
A Google security audit also found problems in libexif. We are preparing
updates for these issues. (CVE-2007-6351/CVE-2007-6352)
- wireshark 0.99.7 security problems
Multiple bugs were fixed in wireshark 0.99.7, updated packages for these
problems are currently in QA.
- various MySQL security issues
We are currently testing a MySQL update to fix various security issues
discovered.
- krb5 small security issues
We are currently testing fixes for the reported krb5 security issues.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# teTeX: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200711-26**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in teTeX, possibly allowing
to execute arbitrary code or overwrite arbitrary files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/tetex** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.0\_p1-r6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.0\_p1-r6** |

### Background

teTeX is a complete TeX distribution for editing documents.

### Description

Joachim Schrod discovered several buffer overflow vulnerabilities and
an insecure temporary file creation in the "dvilj" application that is
used by dvips to convert DVI files to printer formats (CVE-2007-5937,
CVE-2007-5936). Bastien Roucaries reported that the "dvips" application
is vulnerable to two stack-based buffer overflows when processing DVI
documents with long \href{} URIs (CVE-2007-5935). teTeX also includes
code from Xpdf that is vulnerable to a memory corruption and two
heap-based buffer overflows (GLSA 200711-22); and it contains code from
T1Lib that is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing an overly
long font filename (GLSA 200710-12).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to process a specially crafted
DVI or PDF file which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application. A local
attacker could exploit the "dvilj" vulnerability to conduct a symlink
attack to overwrite arbitrary files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All teTeX users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/tetex-3.0_p1-r6"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
