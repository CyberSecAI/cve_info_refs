| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=387431#c0)  Josh Bressers    2007-11-16 19:10:48 UTC  ``` Peter Valchev from the Google Security Team told the Cairo upstream project of an integer overflow in the way Cairo decodes PNG image data.  To quote the mail from Peter:       As an example, cairo supports creating a new image surface from a PNG     image file - see cairo-png.c, function     cairo_image_surface_create_from_png().  It calls read_png(), where the     input filename is parsed, and memory is allocated to hold the resulting     surface as follows:      cairo-png.c: read_png()     ..     png_get_IHDR (png, info,     &png_width, &png_height, &depth,     &color_type, &interlace, NULL, NULL);     ..     pixel_size = 4;     data = malloc (png_width * png_height * pixel_size);     ..      Note that png_width and png_height come from libpng's IHDR. The image     width and height are restricted in libpng's pngconf.h, and by default the     restrictions are as follows:     # define PNG_USER_WIDTH_MAX 1000000L     # define PNG_USER_HEIGHT_MAX 1000000L      so any width < 1000000 and height < 1000000 will pass through libpng,     allowing an integer overflow in cairo's read_png() function above.   The upstream fix can be found here: <http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=cairo;a=commitdiff;h=5c7d2d14d78e4dfb1ef6d2c40f0910f177e07360> <http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=cairo;a=commitdiff;h=e49bcde27f88e21d5b8037a0089a226096f6514b>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=387431#c4)  Josh Bressers    2007-11-29 14:32:20 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=387431#c6)  Red Hat Product Security    2008-01-17 11:20:15 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-1078.html>  Fedora:   <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F7/FEDORA-2007-3818>   <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F8/FEDORA-2007-3913>     ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=387431#c7)  Fedora Update System    2008-01-19 00:00:26 UTC  ``` cairo-1.4.14-1.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- SUN Java 1.5 and 1.6 update
SUN Java 1.5.0 was brought to update14 and SUN Java 1.6.0 was
brought to update4. Details for the security issues fixed are not
yet publicly known, but the changelog lists several issues marked
as security.
The update also contains timezone update 2007k and was released
for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- nss\_ldap incorrect data
nss\_ldap returned incorrect data under certain circumstances to
the calling process. Some applications could therefore work with
wrong user data (CVE-2007-5794).
This has been fixed for all distributions containing nss\_ldap.
- cairo integer overflows in PNG decoder
The cairo libraries were updated to fix several integer overflows
while decoding PNG images. This can be exploited remotely with
user-assistance to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2007-5503)
Updates have been provided for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE Linux
10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3
- geronimo start script problems
A chown in the SUSE supplied Apache geronimo init script could
change ownership of directories it did not own, due to following
symlinks. The default setup would corrupt /var/tmp on start
of geronimo.
While there is potential to exploit this problem,
the administrator will have likely noticed this before already.
- moodle XSS problems
The install script of moodle is vulnerable to cross site scripting
(XSS). This flaw is only exploitable if moodle isn't fully installed
yet. Therefore it's unlikely to be much of a problem in practice. To
actually exploit it an attacker would have to know about a person
that is just about to install moodle (CVE-2008-0123).
- SDL\_image GIF problems
Specially crafted GIF files could crash the SDL\_image library
(CVE-2006-4484).
Updates have been released for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2
and 10.3.
- python imageop integer overflow
Specially crafted images could trigger an integer overflow in the
imageop module of python (CVE-2007-4965).
Python has been updated on all SUSE Linux based distributions.
- Mysql security problems
The database server MySQL was updated to fix various security
vulnerabilities. Note: not all versions are affected by every bug:
- CVE-2007-2583: a denial of service attack in in\_decimal::set for
logged in users.
- CVE-2007-2691: RENAME TABLE did not require DROP privileges,
allowing remote authenticated users to rename arbitrary tables
- CVE-2007-2692: remote authenticated users could gain privileges
due to a bug in SQL SECURITY INVOKER stored routine handling
- CVE-2007-5925: a denial of service attack by remote authenticated
users via a certain CONTAINS operation on an indexed column
- CVE-2007-5969: allowed remote authenticated users to overwrite
system table information and gain privileges via symlinks
- CVE-2007-6303: allowed remote authenticated users to gain
privileges via CREATE SQL SECURITY DEFINER VIEW and ALTER VIEW
statements
- CVE-2007-6304: denial of service attack by remote authenticated
users by performing a specific SHOW TABLE STATUS query
MySQL has been updated on all SUSE Linux based distributions.
- NX also affected by X.org security problems
This update fixes various Xserver security issues that are also
present in NX:
XInput Extension Memory Corruption Vulnerability [IDEF2888 CVE-2007-6427].
TOG-CUP Extension Memory Corruption Vulnerability [IDEF2901 CVE-2007-6428].
EVI Extension Integer Overflow Vulnerability [IDEF2902 CVE-2007-6429].
MIT-SHM Extension Integer Overflow Vulnerability [IDEF2904 CVE-2007-6429].
- xemacs commandline buffer overflow
A buffer overflow in xemacs commandline handling was
fixed. (CVE-2007-6109)
This problem affected only openSUSE 10.3.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=387431#c0)  Josh Bressers    2007-11-16 19:10:48 UTC  ``` Peter Valchev from the Google Security Team told the Cairo upstream project of an integer overflow in the way Cairo decodes PNG image data.  To quote the mail from Peter:       As an example, cairo supports creating a new image surface from a PNG     image file - see cairo-png.c, function     cairo_image_surface_create_from_png().  It calls read_png(), where the     input filename is parsed, and memory is allocated to hold the resulting     surface as follows:      cairo-png.c: read_png()     ..     png_get_IHDR (png, info,     &png_width, &png_height, &depth,     &color_type, &interlace, NULL, NULL);     ..     pixel_size = 4;     data = malloc (png_width * png_height * pixel_size);     ..      Note that png_width and png_height come from libpng's IHDR. The image     width and height are restricted in libpng's pngconf.h, and by default the     restrictions are as follows:     # define PNG_USER_WIDTH_MAX 1000000L     # define PNG_USER_HEIGHT_MAX 1000000L      so any width < 1000000 and height < 1000000 will pass through libpng,     allowing an integer overflow in cairo's read_png() function above.   The upstream fix can be found here: <http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=cairo;a=commitdiff;h=5c7d2d14d78e4dfb1ef6d2c40f0910f177e07360> <http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=cairo;a=commitdiff;h=e49bcde27f88e21d5b8037a0089a226096f6514b>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=387431#c4)  Josh Bressers    2007-11-29 14:32:20 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=387431#c6)  Red Hat Product Security    2008-01-17 11:20:15 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-1078.html>  Fedora:   <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F7/FEDORA-2007-3818>   <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F8/FEDORA-2007-3913>     ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=387431#c7)  Fedora Update System    2008-01-19 00:00:26 UTC  ``` cairo-1.4.14-1.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.

Package        : libcairo
Vulnerability  : integer overflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-5503

Peter Valchev (Google Security) discovered a series of integer
overflow weaknesses in Cairo, a vector graphics rendering library used
by many other applications.  If an application uses cairo to render a
maliciously-crafted PNG image, the vulnerability allows the execution
of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.4-4.1+etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.10-1.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libcairo packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian 4.0 (stable)
- -------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

# Welcome to the Gentoo wiki!

Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!

## Available documentation

To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the [Documentation topic](#Documentation_topics) links provided below.

Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a *Handbook:* or *Project:* prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective *Discussion* pages.

Find something to add or edit? The [*Getting started*](#Getting_started) section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.

Most importantly, the **Gentoo Handbook** is among the best documents found on the wiki:

 [Gentoo Handbook (Official installation documentation)](/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page "Handbook:Main Page")

 **Important**
Due to usability issues the [visual editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVisualEditor "wikipedia:Wikipedia:VisualEditor") has been temporarily disabled. See [bug #910279](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910279) for more details.
#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

### [amd64 – Advanced choices](#amd64-advanced)

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

The *amd64* architecture is intended for use on AMD 64-bit CPUs as well as 64-bit **Intel Pentium/Core/Xeon** processors.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

PowerPC CPUs can operate in two modes: *big-endian* and *little-endian*.

* The **ppc** and **ppc64** stages are *big-endian* stages and can be used with *any PowerPC* CPU, including some old Apple™ hardware.
* The **ppc64le** stages are *little-endian* stages and are created for running on *POWER8 and newer* CPUs.
* The **power9le** stages are *little-endian* stages optimized exclusively for *POWER9* CPUs.

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# AMD64 x86 emulation GTK+ library: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200712-24**

Multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities in the AMD64 x86 emulation GTK+
libraries may result in the execution of arbitrary code in applications
using Cairo.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-gtklibs** on the amd64 architecture |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **20071214** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **20071214** |

### Background

Cairo is a 2D vector graphics library with cross-device output support.
The AMD64 x86 emulation GTK+ library packages Cairo libraries for 32bit
x86 emulation on AMD64.

### Description

The Cairo versions used by the AMD64 x86 emulation GTK+ libraries were
vulnerable to integer overflow vulnerabilities (GLSA 200712-04).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view or process a specially
crafted PNG image file in an application linked against Cairo, possibly
leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All AMD64 x86 emulation GTK+ library users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-gtklibs-20071214"
```

##### 3. Problem Description

I Security Issues

a. Setting ActiveX killbit
Starting from this release, VMware has set the killbit on its
ActiveX controls. Setting the killbit ensures that ActiveX
controls cannot run in Internet Explorer (IE), and avoids
Microsoft KB article 240797 and the related references on this
topic.
Security vulnerabilities have been reported for ActiveX controls
provided by VMware when run in IE. Under specific circumstances,
exploitation of these ActiveX controls might result in denial-of-
service or can allow running of arbitrary code when the user
browses a malicious Web site or opens a malicious file in IE
browser. An attempt to run unsafe ActiveX controls in IE might
result in pop-up windows warning the user.
Note: IE can be configured to run unsafe ActiveX controls without
prompting. VMware recommends that you retain the default
settings in IE, which prompts when unsafe actions are
requested.
Earlier, VMware had issued knowledge base articles, KB 5965318 and
KB 9078920 on security issues with ActiveX controls. To avoid
malicious scripts that exploit ActiveX controls, do not enable
unsafe ActiveX objects in your browser settings. As a best
practice, do not browse untrusted Web sites as an administrator
and do not click OK or Yes if prompted by IE to allow certain
actions.
VMware would like to thank Julien Bachmann, Shennan Wang, Shinnai,
and Michal Bucko for reporting these issues to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2008-3691, CVE-2008-3692,
CVE-2008-3693, CVE-2008-3694, CVE-2008-3695, CVE-2007-5438, and
CVE-2008-3696 to the security issues with VMware ActiveX controls.

b. VMware ISAPI Extension Denial of Service

The Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) is
an API that extends the functionality of Internet Information
Server (IIS). VMware uses ISAPI extensions in its Server product.
One of the ISAPI extensions provided by VMware is vulnerable to a
remote denial of service. By sending a malformed request, IIS
might shut down. IIS 6.0 restarts automatically. However, IIS 5.0
does not restart automatically when its Startup Type is set to Manual.
VMware would like to thank the Juniper Networks J-Security
Security Research Team for reporting this issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-3697 to this issue.

f. VMware Consolidated Backup (VCB) command-line utilities may expose sensitive information

VMware Consolidated Backup command-line utilities accept the user
password through the -p command-line option. Users logged into the
ESX service console or into the system that runs VCB could gain
access to the username and password used by VCB command-line
utilities
when such commands are running.
The ESX patch and the new version of VCB resolve this issue by
providing an alternative way of passing the password used by VCB
command-line utilities.
VCB in ESX
----------
The following options are recommended for passing the password:
1. The password is specified in /etc/backuptools.conf
(PASSWORD=xxxxx), and -p is not used in the command line.
/etc/backuptools.conf file permissions are read/write only
for root.
2. No password is specified in /etc/backuptools.conf and the
-p option is not used in the command line. The user will be
prompted to enter a password.
ESX is not affected unless you use VCB.
Stand-alone VCB
---------------
The following options are recommended for passing the password:
1. The password is specified in config.js (PASSWORD=xxxxx), and -p
is not used in the command line. The file permissions on config.js
are read/write only for the administrator. The config.js file is
located in folder "config" of the VCB installation folder. For
example,
C:\Program Files\Vmware\Vmware Consolidated Backup Framework\config.
2. The password is specified in the registry, and is not specified in
config.js, and -p is not used in the command line. Access to the
registry key holding the password is allowed only to the
administrator.
The location of the registry key is:
On Windows x86: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\VMware, Inc.\
VMware Consolidated Backup\Password
On Windows x64: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\
VMware, Inc.\VMware Consolidated Backup\Password
3. The password is not specified in the registry, and is not
specified in
config.js, and -p is not used in the command line. The user will be
prompted to enter a password.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-2101 to this issue.

g. Third Party Library libpng Updated to 1.2.29

Several flaws were discovered in the way third party library
libpng handled various PNG image chunks. An attacker could
create a carefully crafted PNG image file in such a way that
it causes an application linked with libpng to crash when the
file is manipulated.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2007-5269 to this issue.
NOTE: There are multiple patches required to remediate the issue.

##### II ESX Service Console rpm updates

a. update to bind

This update upgrades the service console rpms for bind-utils and
bind-lib to version 9.2.4-22.el3.
Version 9.2.4.-22.el3 addresses the recently discovered
vulnerability in the BIND software used for Domain Name
resolution (DNS). VMware doesn't install all the BIND packages
on ESX Server and is not vulnerable by default to the reported
vulnerability. Of the BIND packages, VMware only ships bind-util
and bind-lib in the service console and these components by
themselves cannot be used to setup a DNS server. Bind-lib and
bind-util are used in client DNS applications like nsupdate,
nslookup, etc.
VMware explicitly discourages installing applications like BIND
on the service console. In case the customer has installed BIND,
and the DNS server is configured to support recursive queries,
their ESX Server system is affected and they should replace BIND
with a patched version.
Note: ESX Server will use the DNS server on the network it is
on, so it is important to patch that DNS server.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-1447 to this issue.

| [Description](#c0)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-26 00:36:39 UTC  ``` There's several possible integer overflows in the PNG handling code in Cairo, at least one of which can be caused by user controlled values when opening large images, possibly leading to a buffer overflow.  Upstream fixes are here: <http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=cairo;a=commitdiff;h=5c7d2d14d78e4dfb1ef6d2c40f0910f177e07360> <http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=cairo;a=commitdiff;h=e49bcde27f88e21d5b8037a0089a226096f6514b>  According to upstream, a 1.4.12 release is pending. Please commit a patched bump to 1.4.10, or 1.4.12 as soon as it's out. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Doug Goldstein (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-29 19:39:29 UTC  ``` Ebuild is in the tree ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-29 20:21:35 UTC  ``` Public per $URL. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-29 20:26:49 UTC  ``` Arches, please test and mark stable x11-libs/cairo-1.4.12. Target keywords : "alpha amd64 arm hppa ia64 mips ppc ppc64 s390 sh sparc x86"  I assume 1.5.2 is also affected? If so, there hopefully is a ported fix the development branch. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Christian Faulhammer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-30 13:07:24 UTC  ``` x86 stable ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Markus Rothe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-30 13:32:39 UTC  ``` ppc64 stable ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Jeroen Roovers (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-30 14:09:59 UTC  ``` Stable for HPPA. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Steve Dibb (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-30 20:29:06 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Tobias Scherbaum (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-30 22:40:40 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Ewgenij Starostin    2007-12-01 01:55:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=200350#c3)) > I assume 1.5.2 is also affected? If so, there hopefully is a ported fix the > development branch. The fixes from the two diffs are already in 1.5.2, except those relating to pixman. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Raúl Porcel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-04 12:28:31 UTC  ``` alpha/ia64/sparc stable ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-04 23:42:36 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 201298](show_bug.cgi?id=201298 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - CVE-2007-5503 - Vulnerability in Cairo - Boundary Condition Error") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-04 23:44:22 UTC  ``` glsa request filed ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-05 01:23:42 UTC  ``` true, for the 1.5 master the changes were introduced long time ago: <http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=cairo;a=commit;h=5c7d2d14d78e4dfb1ef6d2c40f0910f177e07360> ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-09 21:04:03 UTC  ``` GLSA 200712-04 ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Peter Volkov (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-03-06 09:51:57 UTC  ``` Does not affect current (2008.0) release.

# VMware Player, Server, Workstation: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201209-25**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in VMware Player, Server,
and Workstation, allowing remote and local attackers to conduct several
attacks, including privilege escalation, remote execution of arbitrary
code, and a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-player** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.5.5.328052** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-workstation** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **6.5.5.328052** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-server** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.0.9.156507** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

VMware Player, Server, and Workstation allow emulation of a complete PC
on a PC without the usual performance overhead of most emulators.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in VMware Player, Server,
and Workstation. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

Local users may be able to gain escalated privileges, cause a Denial of
Service, or gain sensitive information.

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file,
possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code, or a Denial
of Service. Remote attackers also may be able to spoof DNS traffic, read
arbitrary files, or inject arbitrary web script to the VMware Server
Console.

Furthermore, guest OS users may be able to execute arbitrary code on the
host OS, gain escalated privileges on the guest OS, or cause a Denial of
Service (crash the host OS).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Player. We recommend that users
unmerge VMware Player:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-player"

```

NOTE: Users could upgrade to
“>=app-emulation/vmware-player-3.1.5”, however these packages are
not currently stable.

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Workstation. We recommend that
users unmerge VMware Workstation:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-workstation"

```

NOTE: Users could upgrade to
“>=app-emulation/vmware-workstation-7.1.5”, however these packages
are not currently stable.

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Server. We recommend that users
unmerge VMware Server:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-server"

```

# Cairo: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200712-04**

Multiple integer overflows were discovered in Cairo, possibly leading to
the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-libs/cairo** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.12** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.12** |

### Background

Cairo is a 2D vector graphics library with cross-device output support.

### Description

Multiple integer overflows were reported, one of which Peter Valchev
(Google Security) found to be leading to a heap-based buffer overflow
in the cairo\_image\_surface\_create\_from\_png() function that processes
PNG images.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view or process a specially
crafted PNG image file in an application linked against Cairo, possibly
leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Cairo users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/cairo-1.4.12"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
