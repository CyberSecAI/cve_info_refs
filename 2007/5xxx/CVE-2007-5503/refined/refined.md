{
  "CVE-2007-5503": {
    "description": "Integer overflow in the Cairo library when decoding PNG image data. By providing a crafted PNG file, an application using Cairo could be forced to allocate a smaller buffer than needed. This can lead to a heap buffer overflow and the execution of arbitrary code.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in cairo's read_png function when allocating memory for a PNG image. The width and height parameters, read from the PNG file's IHDR chunk, are multiplied together without sufficient checks to prevent an overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application processing the crafted PNG image. A denial-of-service condition may also occur if a crash is triggered.",
    "attack_vectors": "Specially crafted PNG image file. The attacker needs to entice a user to open or process the image using a vulnerable application that uses the Cairo library for PNG decoding.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PNG file to a user and convince the user to process it through a vulnerable application. User assistance is required."
