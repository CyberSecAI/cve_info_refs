{
  "CVE-2007-5947": {
    "description": "The jar protocol handler in Mozilla Firefox retrieves the inner URL regardless of its MIME type, and considers HTML documents within a jar archive to have the same origin as the inner URL, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a jar: URI.",
    "root_cause": "The jar protocol handler in Mozilla Firefox does not validate the MIME type of the content within a jar archive and incorrectly assigns the origin of the inner URL.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the browser to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.",
    "attack_vector": "By crafting a malicious zip file, then tricking a user into following a `jar:` URI, an attacker could execute arbitrary code.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to host or upload the malicious zip archive on a website, and be able to convince a user to open a malicious jar: URI."
