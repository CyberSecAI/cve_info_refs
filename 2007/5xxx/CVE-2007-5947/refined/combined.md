1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Mozilla Firefox packages were brought to security update version
2.0.0.10 for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE Linux 10.0, 10.1 and
openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
These packages include the Canvas regression fix also fixed in
2.0.0.11, so we are effectively at 2.0.0.11 with our packages.
Mozilla Firefox for Novell Linux Desktop 9 is still being prepared,
same for Mozilla Thunderbird 2.0.0.9 and Mozilla and Seamonkey Suite
packages.
The update was released on 29th of November.
Following security problems were fixed:
MFSA 2007-37 / CVE-2007-5947: The jar protocol handler in Mozilla
Firefox retrieves the inner URL regardless of its MIME type, and
considers HTML documents within a jar archive to have the same origin
as the inner URL, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks via a jar: URI.
MFSA 2007-38 / CVE-2007-5959:
The Firefox 2.0.0.10 update contains fixes for three bugs that improve
the stability of the product. These crashes showed some evidence of
memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that
with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.
MFSA 2007-39 / CVE-2007-5960:
Gregory Fleischer demonstrated that it was possible to generate a fake
HTTP Referer header by exploiting a timing condition when setting the
window.location property. This could be used to conduct a Cross-site
Request Forgery (CSRF) attack against websites that rely only on the
Referer header as protection against such attacks.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of Firefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=369814#c0)• 18 years ago |
|  | |

Any site that allows image uploads (e.g. avatar images) without binary content sniffing is likely to be vulnerable to XSS (in Gecko browsers only) as a result. An attacker would only have to upload a malicious zip file to the site and get users to follow a jar: link.
Possible fixes:
\* Refuse to open zip file contents with jar: unless the file has a mime type appropriate for zips, such as application/zip.
\* Make jar: not be considered same-origin with the rest of the hosting domain, but only with other contents of the jar.
\* Both of the above.

I like this one, if it doesn't break existing sites too much...
The other one is actually kinda hard. Esp. on branches. And I'm not sure it wouldn't break sites even more. :(

There are also sites that let users upload zips (in order to share their contents), but probably fewer.

Yeah, good point. :(
So for branch the change is actually simple to change this behavior, at first glance -- just modify the nsIJARURI code in SecurityCompareURIs somehow. Probably to just get the zip file URI and do an Equals() check on it? Not sure what that would break, offhand....
For trunk, what do you think of making it so <http://foo> subsumes jar:<http://foo> but not vice versa or something?
That would mean you could reach into the jar, but it couldn't reach out.

We should probably accept at least application/x-java-archive and application/zip (which are in /etc/mime.types on FC6), and probably do some research to look for other legitimate MIME types. Some searching on Google turns up application/java-archive, application/x-jar, application/x-zip-compressed, application/x-compressed, and multipart/x-zip, although I didn't look very hard.

Also the XPInstall type.
Note also that if we enforce the type we'll need to force the "jar" extension to be associated with one of these types no matter what our OS settings say...

Wow, that sucks. On the one hand our current behavior makes perfect logical and useful sense, and on the other what web site is going to be expecting to have to defend against this?
What "existing sites" are we going to break, maybe a few experimental Firefox-only demos at best? We can afford to neuter this harshly if we have to (but it makes me sad).

If anything breaks, it'll be intranet applications for the most part, I suspect. That's the logical place to use it, and I've seen a number of newsgroup questions along those lines.
For trunk, we plan to use jar: for the offline web app stuff, as I understand. But that's trunk.

You don't have to use jar: for that, you could use moz-offline: which maps to the same thing but only works on local files, or whatever other special properties you need. And if it's for offline apps, it shouldn't need to reach into frames that are on-line.

|  | |

For offline apps, we are using jar: URLs that point to remote files, not local files, and we definitely need them to be same-origin with regular http: frames from the same domain. There's no such thing as "online" or "offline" frames, just frames that happen to be served from the offline cache, which does not change their security status. The same-origin security model is not changed at all for offline apps.

So I'd favour Jesse's first option, except that I'm afraid that if a server serves all .jar files with type application/zip, there may be a myriad of ways for an untrusted user to get unsanitized .jar files onto the server.
Here's another option: create a new MIME type, say application/x-sanitized-jar. jar: loads of resources with that MIME type are considered same-domain with the inner URL. jar: loads that see other MIME types are considered same-domain with other resources from the same jar only.

I'd also like to point out that thinking in terms of "same-domain" is not the best approach for trunk. It'll get us in trouble; we should be thinking in terms of what subsumes (or does not subsume) what.
Come to think of it, same for branch -- the "is same domain" check on branch is asymmetric.

OK sure. So rephrase to say that we want to be able to have jar: URLs have the same principal as their inner URL, possibly conditional on the server return application/x-sanitized-jar as I mentioned above.

That seems reasonable to me. So basically in those cases the jar channel would give itself the principal from its inner channel/URI instead of what it does now?
Andthen we make nsScriptSecurityManager::SecurityCompareURIs treat jar: URIs asymmetrically on branch? And something more interesting on trunk?

Hum. How does access control to WHATWG storage and cookies work? They're based on domain so I think non-sanitized JARs will just have to be prevented from accessing them. And I don't know how hard that would be. Maybe we should just disable remote jar: loads completely unless the MIME type is application/x-sanitized-jar.
If we were to just go with Jesse's proposal #1, what kind of risks would we face? I'm not sure if my concern in [comment #12](/show_bug.cgi?id=369814#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - jar: protocol is an XSS hazard due to ignoring mime type and being considered same-origin with hosting site") (and [comment #3](/show_bug.cgi?id=369814#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - jar: protocol is an XSS hazard due to ignoring mime type and being considered same-origin with hosting site")) is valid. Presumably sites have to be careful about what types they allow users to upload, but I have no idea what sort of checks people really use.

> Hum. How does access control to WHATWG storage and cookies work?
WHATWG storage uses the jar's inner URI. document.cookie looks like it doesn't work really well for jar:.
What we could do is just disallow access to DOM storage from jar:s that aren't application/x-sanitized-jar.
> Maybe we should just disable remote jar: loads completely unless the MIME type
> is application/x-sanitized-jar
If we hardcoded .jar files to get that type, we \_could\_, I guess. But it'd definitely completely break all existing consumers of signed jars, and those exist for sure.

We could do that, but running around patching access checks here and there doesn't give me a good feeling.

Hmm, and making an exception for signed jars would bring us back to the possibility of using XSS attacks via signed jars. But who uses remote signed jars with the jar: protocol?
It sure would be nice if we could just get away with requiring jar: inner URIs to have application/zip or other known-good MIME type...

Well... Right now DOM storage has explicit code to dig into jar:s. We'd just remove that code. ;)
> But who uses remote signed jars with the jar: protocol?
Anyone who wants to use enablePrivilege, pretty much. Intranet apps are probably the most common use case. We get questions about this in newsgroups not infrequently, so those folks would be the ones to really ask. ;)

Like I said in [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=369814#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - jar: protocol is an XSS hazard due to ignoring mime type and being considered same-origin with hosting site"), I'm in favor.

I don't think so, for a non-public, non-remote-code-execution bug, although I just might not be familiar enough with the requirements for blocking.
Also, I suspect bonsai watchers will be able to figure out pretty quickly exactly what hole a patch here fixes (i.e. the technical overhead to understanding the code/patch is low, and its purpose can't easily be obscured), so this probably needs to be fixed on branch and trunk in a fairly small window, and I'm not going to be able to fix this in time for the next branch release.

FYI, Latest NoScript development build (disclosed today, after pdp's post) takes a quite drastic but reasonable (considering the behavior of other browsers) measure about this issue.
JAR resources can still be loaded as images, applet classes and the like, but they cannot be loaded as documents.
A regexp-based whitelist is maintained in the "NoScript Options|Advanced|JAR" panel in order to allow specific intranet applications to behave like they always did.

This can be blocked in nsDocShell::GetAllowJavascript() by disallowing scripts when the document comes from a JAR channel and doesn't meet some criteria for "OK for scripting".
If we want to use the MIME type of the archive itself we will need to expose that on nsIJarChannel. Intranet apps that use signed code will have to make sure their apps use one of the standard .jar MIME types "application/java-archive" or "application/x-jar" (these do not appear to be defined by default in Apache so any use should be intentional). Since Java applets can "phone home" no one is going to allow the uploading of true unvetted jar files to a host that is at risk of XSS.
An alternate approach would be to only allow scripting from a whitelisted domain. This means we'd have to write whitelisting UI (an infobar at least) and worry that users will incorrectly decide which domains are OK to host .jars (most of them won't have the knowledge or context to know what decision they're making). Or else we bury the whitelist in which case we're just breaking signed sites and dumping a huge tech support load on the intranet IT depts.
Can we disable signed-app support entirely for Firefox 3 or Mozilla2? If sites need to do privileged things have users install an addon. The current system is a big series of "whatever" buttons thrown at the user.Flags: blocking1.8.1.11+ → blocking1.8.1.10+

I would like to remove support for netscape.securitymanager.enablePrivilege, but I don't think that will affect this bug in particular: it can be useful (and has been done) to ship an entire normal-privilege app as a JAR file, because it ensure cache consistency and can be downloaded as a unit, among other reasons.
So I think we should definitely try to preserve ordinary scripting from JARs served as application/java-archive and application/x-jar

I wonder if it would it be sufficient to just return a null principal from the JAR channel if it doesn't meet these criteria?

Right now, any unsigned jar returns a null principal. Whereupon the page gets a principal based on the jar: URI. Then there is inner URI magic that happens.
dveditz and I did discuss making that magic not happen when the jar fails those criteria. That is, having the jar just not be same-origin with the site it's on. We'd also have to fix all the code that manually checks for jar: URIs and gets the host (and doesn't go through the principal!): cookies, permission manager, that sort of thing.

right now an unsigned jar returns nsnull as its owner, it does not return a nsNullPrincipal. If it did it would not get a principal based on its inner URI later on.
I'm not in favor though, I don't have much confidence we can root out all the code that uses the document URI rather than the principal.

first stab
nsIAllowScriptsChannel only seems to be able to forbid scripts, right?
I think it's worth thinking about interface docs here (that is, describing which channels should implement this interface); that might lead to a better name for it too.
> if (mJarFile) {
>+ mAllowScripts = PR\_TRUE;
I see nothing preventing reuse of a jar: channel, in which case on the second time around it'll end up with mAllowScripts = true...
I suggest nulling out mJarFile (and resetting mAllowScripts?) up front in AsyncOpen and Open.

Ignoring for the moment that the check should just use EqualsLiteral(), this doesn't seem right. If the server is HTTP/0.9 (and hence doesn't send back a type), we'll guess a type ourselves. And then we can easily guess one of those types.
Same thing would happen for non-HTTP jar: URIs, though that wouldn't be as big a problem, because a non-HTTP URI would not be same-origin with an HTTP site...
What behavior do we actually want in those cases?

We could strip LOAD\_CALL\_CONTENT\_SNIFFERS from the load flags for the inner
channel. We don't ever use the sniffed content type from the JAR channel.
We probably want to do that regardless of how we deal with non-http channels.

That wouldn't help, because HTTP \_always\_ provides a content type, event if it doesn't call content sniffers. Content sniffers can \_override\_ the server type, but if there is no server type we will always invoke the unknown decoder.
I agree that we should probably not call content sniffers on the underlying channel for jar:, though.

What do we use to guess, anything more than the extension? As a first pass I'd think that if a site allows a .jar extension we can guess it's intended to be active content (either an actual java-archive or a Mozilla thing).
We don't want to sniff the actual content looking for the PKZIP magic number, though. That would re-enable what we're trying to prevent.

As far as cookies are concerned they would be. Probably DOM storage as well (we treat them as super-cookies) and the password manager. But not truly same-origin for purposes of viewing frames and such.

Didn't care for the name, but one advantage of a separate iface is that we could put it on other types of channels in the future that may have similar concerns. For example, would we want to block scripts on file: uris rather than attempt to limit the access of such scripts (be more like IE)?
I guess until we think of an actual case where we'd want this on another type of channel we can leave it on nsIJarChannel (which was my first thought anyway).

In general, the data and the extension. At the moment, I suspect it ends up being just the extension, except maybe for file:// URIs.
> We don't want to sniff the actual content looking for the PKZIP magic number,
Well, eventually we do... but I think at that point we probably want to detect the file as an application/zip file.
I'll try to review this tonight.

Why'd you switch from "allow" to "deny" scripts? Means you have to switch the sense of things when testing it, making the code more verbose.

Well as bz pointed out, this can't really Allow scripts when they wouldn't be allowed, only Deny them when they would otherwise be allowed. But I don't particularly mind either way..

If we're getting the header, I have two questions:
1) Is it still OK to do a case-sensitive comparison?
2) Is it OK to ignore the fact that there might be params in the header?

How about:

It's probably PRPackedBool time here, by the way.

Guys,
Please note that the vulnerability is more severe and more difficult to mitigate than initially indicated; it does not require the attacked site to host a malicious JAR file, as the security context is not properly updated on 302 redirects, as discovered here:
<http://blog.beford.org/?p=8>
...and as such, it affects a good part of web.
I can't help but notice that this is strangely reminiscent of my discovery of wyciwyg: redirect behavior that led to same-origin policy bypass and content spoofing (see [bug 387333](/show_bug.cgi?id=387333 "VERIFIED FIXED - [FIX]unauthorized access to wyciwyg:// documents possible")), and perhaps indicative of a need to audit and fix redirect handling once and for all protocols, to mitigate the impact of future flaws.

> as the security context is not properly updated on 302 redirects
You mean if a site has an open redirector it has a problem? Of course such a site has problems in general...
In any case, we should certainly improve that on our end. I've filed [bug 403331](/show_bug.cgi?id=403331 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sort out jar: behavior on HTTP redirects") on that.
> audit and fix redirect handling once and for all protocols
There are two aspects to redirect handling:
1) Is it OK to redirect?
2) What should happen when the redirect happens?
Your wyciwyg: was an instance of point 1. That's been fully fixed on trunk; any protocol can easily specify whether it's OK to redirect to it, and all the in-tree ones do.
Point 2 is somewhat more complicated, because it depends on what the caller is doing with the HTTP channel. It needs to be handled on a case-by-case basis.

Boris,
Yes; open or partly open redirectors are common, and I would guess that most of the top 500 most popular sites on the Web have some. Far fewer sites allow arbitrary files to be uploaded with no filtering, so this probably means the bug should be considered a bit more significant, hence my note.
I also don't think there are any particular inherent security "problems in general" with redirectors - other than the human-assisted possibility of link-based phishing, of course - so I would not dismiss this as a site design error; 302 behavior on jar: handling could not be reasonably anticipated by any web developer as a legitimate caveat for URL redirection.

xss in a sandbox via mime overriding is possible this way:

style.jpg:

another strangeness is:

not sure this is effective in all cases.
assuming html in jar with bad content type, does any of these work:
1.
<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0;URL=data:text/html;,<script>alert(4)</script>">
2.
<object data="data:text/html;,<script>alert('obj')</script>"></object>
<iframe src="data:text/html;,vv<script>alert('ifr')</script>"></iframe>
3.
<applet code="Clock1" archive="clock.jpg"></applet>
java is active content and probably the java way of |open browser
window| may work
as an additional test |data:text/html| may be replaced with
|javascript| and |<script>| removed

jar:<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=288383!/bug369814c57.html>
The object and iframe issues are fine, the meta refresh can still run scripts. Dave is going to disable meta redirects on the jar docshell similarly to how he's blocking scripts.

Hmm. It's odd that object/iframe don't run script. I would expect them to be able to...

nsScriptSecurityManager::CanExecuteScript() checks parent docshells, I imagine that's preventing it object/iframes from working.

And we really ought to disable plugins on the docshell, too. Flash and Java can do raw sockets even if they can't get cookies from the page. I don't know what you could do that's bad, but better safe than sorry.

Maybe we should just refuse to unpack the jar?

New version:
\* Only trusts http and jar inner channels when checking remote loads, and propagates denyScripts from inner jar channels.
\* Disables javascript, plugins, and metaredirects if loaded from an unsafe content type type, but...
\* Disables loading entirely from unsafe content types by default (can be changed with a pref)

Could also call this isUnsafe, to mirror what docshell does with it (and update the comments, member/variable names in nsJARChannel, etc). Either way is fine by me, really.

Looks great, works great. Even with the pref on it now passes the redirect case.
>+pref("jar.open-bad-types", false);
My only nit was the pref name (as we talked about on IRC). rather than start a new top-level pref namespace please use either security. or network., and "unsafe" might be better than "bad".

This in fact isn't blocked as it should be (if you have the network.jar.open-unsafe-types pref set)
Maybe we should disallow retargeted loads from unsafe channels?

I'm not quite sure what the problem [comment 69](/show_bug.cgi?id=369814#c69 "RESOLVED FIXED - jar: protocol is an XSS hazard due to ignoring mime type and being considered same-origin with hosting site") brings up is. You click on the first link. You're no longer on the jar: page. Then what?

|  | |

The first link opens a new window. The second link targets a javascript: load in the new window, inheriting the principal from the first window, but not its unsafe channel.
Disallowing retargeted loads isn't enough. <a href="data:text/html,<script>..."> will also inherit the security context but not the unsafe channel.
I'm working on a patch that blocks loads in a docshell viewing an unsafe channel that would inherit the security context from that unsafe channel. Does that make sense?

Yeah, I guess. I really wish we could disable script/plugins/redirects on a per-nsIPrincipal basis or something.
Perhaps we should get a followup bug filed on having a way to do this? If we don't for 1.9, we definitely should for 2.0.

Hrm, it might be nicer to inherit ChannelIsUnsafe like AllowJavascript etc. rather than walking the tree in InternalLoad.

How about NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_SECURITY\_ERR or some such? For that matter, I forgot to mention that about the earlier patch; it had some NS\_ERROR\_FAILUREs where a better error code could be used.

so this patch doesn't prevent against covert form in a jar posting using user's
cookie - in this case the referer will be correct (the buzz word is 'session
riding' or CSRF)?
btw, in the testcases one click probably may be saved via <frameset> and
<frame>.
will try to hit this more if i manage to apply the patch with the hidden

this seems nice. this particular case is very hard to secure correctly - it seems to need a lot of kludges, so better kill the functionality.

Yes. We should use an error code docshell recognizes, or add one to docshell's list...

Attached patch

[newer branch patch](attachment.cgi?id=288695&action=diff)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=369814&attachment=288695)

So I'm going to suggest we land something like this on the branch, disabling the feature on unsafe mime types without a pref. I don't think it's worth holding up that release to get everything right in case the pref is set.
On trunk it's probably worth putting something like this in sooner rather than later, and then opening a new bug to restore the pref (possibly dependent on the per-nsIPrincipal blocking bz mentioned in [comment 78](/show_bug.cgi?id=369814#c78 "RESOLVED FIXED - jar: protocol is an XSS hazard due to ignoring mime type and being considered same-origin with hosting site").)
From what I understand we can't add strings (and therefore useful error pages) on the branch, so I chose the malformedURI as the least bad option of the existing error pages. For a trunk patch I'll put together a new set of error page strings.

jar:<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=288662!/mid.html> is not an issue. Even in a regular HTML page if you middle-click on a javascript: link it's opened up in a new blank context and doesn't inherit the owner. (This in fact annoys tons of people as lots of sites use javascript: links for tracking and popup content, and middle-clicking just gets you a blank tab.)
jar:<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=288666!/flash3.swf> runs the plugin content if you manually flip the pref to "unsafe", but a jar'd web page containing embed/object/applet tags does not run the plugin content.
That's safe enough for Firefox 2.0.0.10 since this pref is off. We also need to investigate what origin that content would have.

2.0.0.10-rc1 broke our web application. We have an xpcom application and our web application is using it from the javascript. We are using a signed jar to get UniversalXPConnect privilege. And now we are getting Permission denied to get property Window.IsFrameLoaded. Even after enabling network.jar.open-unsafe-types it does not work (even though javascript error is gone).

Using network.jar.open-unsafe-types will open the jar:, but will not run any script in it. For a web application, you want to be sure you're sending the jar file with either the application/java-archive MIME type or the application/x-jar MIME type. Once you do that, things should work fine.
Daniel, we really need to advertise that in the run-up to 2.0.0.10. At the very least we should have a devmo article, and possibly some posts on the developer blog and to .announce?

trunk patch with tests
Patch looks ok.
I have some issues with the test. Why use a timeout (fragile!) instead of observing events? It'll lead to bizarre orange if the test machine is under load. Also, might be good to use EventUtils.js instead of reimplementing click event stuff. And it'd be great if the test reset the pref to the value it had at test start when it finishes.
I haven't read the test in detail, and it mostly looks fine, but those three jumped out at me.

Neither of these two work in 2.0.0.10. Both give an error page stating that the address isn't valid. Is any more verification necessary for this?

assuming you mean a rotating circle.
don't have trunk with the latest patch at the moment.
on latest linux branch the attachment:
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=289243>
gives a rotating circle after the 3rd click.
on macosx have mixed results - the circle in 2nd window is rotating, but restarting the fox may be needed.
may be a race unrelated to this bug.

In some cases there aren't really any events to observe. Blocked refreshes and inherited-principal loads are just dropped without any events, and I don't get a load event for the error page.
In my local copy I've changed the simple case (the iframe load) to use load events, and waited for the load event before doing the timeout in some cases (to at least reduce the amount of work we're waiting for). I'd welcome suggestions for fixing the other ones.
> It'll lead to bizarre orange if the test machine is under

It won't lead to unexpected orange, but it can lead to greens where there shouldn't be. All these tests are of the form "wait for the child page to try to poke us, fail if it does so". If the timer hits early, we'll lose pokes. Which is arguably worse :/

Hmm. That keeps coming up. We should be firing pageshow at least. Is there a bug on this?
If we can't eliminate all polling, then we can't eliminate all polling. Eliminating as much as we can is great; thank you for doing that!

>+unsafeContentType=The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because it is contained in an archive file that may not be safe to open. Please contact the website owners to inform them of this problem.
The message is much more specific than "unsafeContentType" might lead someone to believe. Either make the message more generic or the property more specific (unsafeJarContentType).
A generic message might be useful in the future so the next firedrill doesn't have to fall back on the malformed URI error :-)
"The page you are trying to view cannot be shown due to its Content-Type. Please contact the website owners to inform them of this problem." (btw don't leave two spaces after a period in web text.)
This is merely a suggestion, if you want to land as-is it's not that wrong.

Attached patch

[test fixes for bug 392567](attachment.cgi?id=290344&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=290344&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=369814&attachment=290344)

After this patch we no longer trust data: uris as inner jar channels (noted in [comment 65](/show_bug.cgi?id=369814#c65 "RESOLVED FIXED - jar: protocol is an XSS hazard due to ignoring mime type and being considered same-origin with hosting site")), which broke the test case for 392567. I checked in this patch to fix the breakage (it breaks that data uri into a separate jar file to be loaded over http)

Until someone figures out a way to ship a default branding package and an override system (see most of the discussion in [bug 302309](/show_bug.cgi?id=302309 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - Embedded applications still need their own branding for netError.xhtml")), any of these dtds that people want to use branding in are going to be forked across the tree.
When making these sorts of changes (adding/changing entities), it would be helpful if folks making the changes would check across the tree for other copies of the files and make the equivalent changes or cc someone from the other app(s)--you can cc me for Camino--since not having the changes will break functionality in those apps. Right now I believe Camino is the only app besides Firefox to have any forked dtd/properties files, but I've seen some discussion about SeaMonkey starting to do this as well.
I'm mentioning this here not to fault Dave, but simply because there are a good number of relevant people cc'd here and I want to raise awareness just a little bit (some developers are already making changes to all copies of the files across the tree, and that's great!).

I'm not sure if this is really related to this bug fix but if someone can take a look here:
<http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=607422>
It broke on .10 .
In short the OP loads a jar archive in an iframe and can not access it when using localhost as domain but can when using the real computer name.
If i understood it right the jar is still accessed through localhost so it seems to be on a different domain but it works.

There is a problem with the fix. It seems to have broken my application. See
<http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=717295>
It leaves me quite desperate, I reported the same issue with FF 2.0.0.10 (which was quickly followed up with 2.0.0.11 in which there were no problems) and with FF 3.0.
I got no useful responses (if any) so far.

The "Unsafe File Type" error message should be documented on developer.mozilla.org:
1) suggested way of fixing the site (using one of the "safe" content types)
2) ways for user to work around the problem (setting the pref)

> block inherited loads from unsafe docshells
For what it's worth, the patch did NOT block those. And the test was buggy, so did not catch that when running in the harness. It \_did\_ catch the problem when run standalone.... I'll fix this in [bug 508369](/show_bug.cgi?id=508369 "RESOLVED FIXED - mochitest-plain: intermittent \"test_bug369814.html | iframes.html loaded from view-source jar type (or from non-jar type), pref disabled: should block a suspicious JAR load\"").

| [Description](#c0)  Aniruddha    2007-11-12 19:54:30 UTC  ``` Description: A security issue has been reported in Mozilla Firefox, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.  The problem is that the "jar:" protocol handler does not validate the MIME type of the contents of an archive, which are then executed in the context of the site hosting the archive. This can be exploited to conduct cross-site scripting attacks on sites that allow a user to upload certain files (e.g. .zip, .png, .doc, .odt, .txt).  Solution: Do not follow untrusted "jar:" links or browse untrusted websites.  Provided and/or discovered by: Reported by Jesse Ruderman in a Bugzilla entry.  Independently discovered by pdp.

CVE-2007-5960 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-5960>):   Mozilla Firefox before 2.0.0.10 and SeaMonkey 1.1.7 sets the Referer header   to the window or frame in which script is running, instead of the address of   the content that initiated the script, which allows remote attackers to spoof   HTTP Referer headers and bypass Referer-based CSRF protection schemes by   setting window.location and using a modal alert dialog that causes the wrong   Referer to be sent.  Fixed in Firefox 2.0.0.10 MFSA 2007-39 Referer-spoofing via window.location race condition MFSA 2007-38 Memory corruption vulnerabilities (rv:1.8.1.10) MFSA 2007-37 jar: URI scheme XSS hazard  Mozilla herd, please advise. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Raúl Porcel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-27 15:01:56 UTC  ``` 2.0.0.10 contains a big regression: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=405584>  I'm working on it ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-29 21:24:35 UTC  ``` The 2.0.0.10 ebuild already contains a fix for the regression mentioned by Raul.

Package        : xulrunner
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-5947 CVE-2007-5959 CVE-2007-5960

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a
runtime environment for XUL applications. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-5947

    Jesse Ruderman and Petko D. Petkov discovered that the URI handler
    for JAR archives allows cross-site scripting.

CVE-2007-5959

    Several crashes in the layout engine were discovered, which might
    allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-5960

    Gregory Fleischer discovered a race condition in the handling of
    the "window.location" property, which might lead to cross-site
    request forgery.

The oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain xulrunner.

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.0.14~pre071019c-0etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.1.11-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2007-37

## jar: URI scheme XSS hazard

Announced
November 26, 2007
Reporter
Jesse Ruderman, Petko D. Petkov, beford.org
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 2.0.0.10
* SeaMonkey 1.1.7

### Description

The `jar:` URI scheme was introduced as a mechanism to support
digitally signed web pages, enabling web sites to load pages packaged
in zip archives containing signatures in java-archive format.

**Jesse Ruderman** and **Petko D. Petkov**
point out this means that sites that allow users to upload binary
content in zip format are effectively allowing users to install
web pages on their site, and these can be used to perform Cross-Site
Scripting (XSS) attacks.

The blogger at **beford.org** noted that redirects
confused Mozilla browsers about the true source of the `jar:`
content: the content was wrongly considered to originate with the
redirecting site rather than the actual source. This meant that an XSS
attack could be mounted against any site with an open redirect even
if it didn't allow uploads. A published proof-of-concept demonstrates
stealing the GMail contact list of users logged-in to GMail.

Support for the jar: URI scheme has been restricted
to files served with a `Content-Type` header of
`application/java-archive` or `application/x-jar`.
Web applications that require signed pages must make sure their .jar
archives are served with this Content-Type. Sites that allow users
to upload binary files should make sure they do not allow these files
to have one of these two MIME types.

# USN-546-2: Firefox regression

4 December 2007

Firefox regression

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) -

## Details

USN-546-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The upstream update included

a faulty patch which caused the drawImage method of the canvas element to

fail. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that Firefox incorrectly associated redirected sites

as the origin of "jar:" contents. A malicious web site could exploit this

to modify or steal confidential data (such as passwords) from other web

sites. ([CVE-2007-5947](/security/CVE-2007-5947))

Various flaws were discovered in the layout and JavaScript engines. By

tricking a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could

execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. ([CVE-2007-5959](/security/CVE-2007-5959))

Gregory Fleischer discovered that it was possible to use JavaScript to

manipulate Firefox's Referer header. A malicious web site could exploit

this to conduct cross-site request forgeries against sites that relied

only on Referer headers for protection from such attacks. ([CVE-2007-5960](/security/CVE-2007-5960))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [2.0.0.11+2nobinonly-0ubuntu0.7.10](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/2.0.0.11%2B2nobinonly-0ubuntu0.7.10)

##### Ubuntu 7.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [2.0.0.11+1nobinonly-0ubuntu0.7.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/2.0.0.11%2B1nobinonly-0ubuntu0.7.4)

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [2.0.0.11+0nobinonly-0ubuntu0.6.10](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/2.0.0.11%2B0nobinonly-0ubuntu0.6.10)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox to effect

the necessary changes.

| [Description](#c0)  Arttu Valo    2007-12-01 11:00:34 UTC  ``` Mozilla Seamonkey 1.1.7 has been released with fixes to security vulnerabilities, apparently the same ones for which Firefox just got its 2.0.0.10 update, too.  Reproducible: Always ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-01 23:41:38 UTC  ``` See [bug 198965](show_bug.cgi?id=198965 "RESOLVED FIXED - www-client/mozilla-firefox < 2.0.0.11 Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2007-{5947,5959,5960})") for vulnerability details. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Lars Wendler (Polynomial-C) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-02 14:37:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 137542](attachment.cgi?id=137542 "030_pango-cairo-1.patch.diff") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=137542&action=edit "030_pango-cairo-1.patch.diff")] 030_pango-cairo-1.patch.diff  There are two changes necessary to get the seamonkey-1.1.6-patches-0.1.tar.bz2 applied:  009_firefox-gdkpango.patch can be dropped, this was finally included into 1.1.7 release. 030_pango-cairo-1.patch needs a small tweak (see attachment). ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Raúl Porcel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-03 21:45:31 UTC  ``` In CVS, thanks Lars for the fix :) ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-04 00:54:06 UTC  ``` Arches, please test and mark stable www-client/seamonkey-1.1.7.

# Mozilla Firefox, SeaMonkey: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200712-21**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox and
Mozilla Seamonkey.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.0.11** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.0.11** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.0.11** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.0.11** |

| Package | **www-client/seamonkey** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.7** |

| Package | **www-client/seamonkey-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.7** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a cross-platform web browser from Mozilla. SeaMonkey
is a free, cross-platform Internet suite.

### Description

Jesse Ruderman and Petko D. Petkov reported that the jar protocol
handler in Mozilla Firefox and Seamonkey does not properly check MIME
types (CVE-2007-5947). Gregory Fleischer reported that the
window.location property can be used to generate a fake HTTP Referer
(CVE-2007-5960). Multiple memory errors have also been reported
(CVE-2007-5959).

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly exploit these vulnerabilities to
execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser and conduct
Cross-Site-Scripting or Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.11"
```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-2.0.0.11"
```

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-1.1.7"
```

All SeaMonkey binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-bin-1.1.7"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Mozilla-based browsers jar: URI cross-site scripting vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#715737

Original Release Date: 2007-11-08 | Last Revised: 2008-11-20

---

### Overview

Mozilla-based web browsers including Firefox contain a vulnerability that may allow an attacker to execute code, or conduct cross-site scripting attacks.

### Description

| The jar: protocol is designed to extract content from ZIP compressed files. Mozilla-based browsers include support for jar: URIs that are of the form jar:[url]![/path/to/file.ext]. The compressed file does not need to have a .zip extension.  From the [GNUCITIZEN](http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/web-mayhem-firefoxs-jar-protocol-issues) blog:*jar: content run within the scope/origin of the secondary URL. Therefore, a URL like this: jar:https:// example.com/test.jar!/t.htm, will render a page which executes within the origin of* *<https://example.com>**.*Since the script in the webpage at the second URL runs in the context of the first URL's page, a cross-site scripting vulnerability occurs.To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could place or link to a specially crafted archive file on a site and convince the user to open the file with a Mozilla based browser. An attacker could use sites that allow user-submitted content distribute malicious archived files. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute cross-site scripting attacks on sites that allow users to upload pictures, archives, or other files. |
| --- |

### Solution

| This vulnerability is addressed in Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.10: From [MFSA 2007-37](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2007/mfsa2007-37.html):*Support for the jar: URI scheme has been restricted to files served with a Content-Type header of* application/java-archive *or* application/x-jar*. Web applications that require signed pages must make sure their .jar archives are served with this Content-Type. Sites that allow users to upload binary files should make sure they do not allow these files to have one of these two MIME types.* |
| --- |

| **Workarounds for network administrators and users**     + NoScript version [1.1.7.8](http://noscript.net/getit#devel) and later may prevent this vulnerability from being exploited.  **Workarounds for** **website administrators**    + Blocking URIs that contain jar: using a reverse proxy or application firewall could prevent an attacker from uploading content that could exploit website visitors. + Website owners who accept user supplied content may wish to serve these files from "safe" domains, such as numbered IP addresses or sub-level domains that can not access sensitive information. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[Bug 369814](/show_bug.cgi?id=369814 "RESOLVED FIXED - jar: protocol is an XSS hazard due to ignoring mime type and being considered same-origin with hosting site") points out that jar: doesn't update its principal (or URI, for that matter) when an HTTP redirect happens. Arguably, it should.
The simplest thing to do here seems to be to replace the "jar file" URI with the post-load URI that the channel loading the jar file ends up with (using NS\_GetFinalChannelURI). Then everything else should Just Work, I think.
Does that make sense?Flags: blocking1.9?Flags: blocking1.8.1.10?

dcamp, do you want to give this a shot? Or should I do it?
We probably need to update our URI when the jar file finishes loading, make sure our originalURI is correct as needed, and set our LOAD\_REPLACE flag on the basis of the underlying channel.

This really bothers me. I don't think we want people doing that in general. Could we instead add a method here to "clone with new jar file" or something? Seems safer.
The rest looks great.

I'm with bz, better to create a new JARURI. and call SetOriginalURI() on the old one, don't hack out that part of the code.
You can get the Entry from the original URI, and then compose that together with the new base URI.
This is going to propagate up in a nested jar:, right?

v2
I really do think we should do what I suggested: have a method on nsIJARURI that creates a "clone with different jar file" thing. That way you don't end up serializing and reparsing nsIURI objects (which is what this patch ends up doing). That is, all the clone method would do is create an nsJARURI, set its mJARFile to the passed-in URI, set its mJAREntry to a clone of our mJAREntry, and return the whole thing as an nsIJARURI.

I think you want to clone this and then NS\_TryToSetImmutable the clone, and use that immutable clone as the inner URI... Otherwise you'll pretty seriously regress performance on signed jar stuff (because every single security check will clone URIs).
>+++ b/modules/libjar/nsJARURI.cpp

This should return error if (!jarFile).
With those two nits, this looks wonderful. r=bzbarsky

Boris, can you verify that this is fixed in the 2.0.0.10 RC1 (<http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2.0.0.10-candidates/rc1/>) aka 1.8.1.10?

I have no idea how to do that short of writing my own tests for it... I doubt I'll be able to do that soon enough to be useful.

Someone with a throw-away gmail account could add a contact or two and try the original PoC from [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=403331#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sort out jar: behavior on HTTP redirects").

[original testcase, with "safe" mime type](attachment.cgi?id=288940) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=288940&action=edit)

Sorry, that's naive... the fix for [bug 369814](/show_bug.cgi?id=369814 "RESOLVED FIXED - jar: protocol is an XSS hazard due to ignoring mime type and being considered same-origin with hosting site") would stop the original PoC regardless of whether we fixed this one. Should work served here with the correct MIME-type to be served as a "we know this is active content" file.

I'm trying to parse this last remark, Dan. Does this mean that the new attached test case should reproduce the bug here or not?

Here's a locally-hosted testcase that can be used for verification. The MIME-type is set to one that the fix for [bug 369814](/show_bug.cgi?id=369814 "RESOLVED FIXED - jar: protocol is an XSS hazard due to ignoring mime type and being considered same-origin with hosting site") will allow to run scripts.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Sign in to GMail
1a. add contacts if you don't have any
2. load the link below:
jar:<http://groups.google.com/searchhistory/url?url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=288946!/jar.html>
Actual results in 1.8.1.9: Jar-Jar taunts you and lists your contacts
Expected results: blank page, security error in js console
(NB: if you get an error page something's wrong with the test)
URL: <http://blog.beford.org/?p=8> → jar:http://groups.google.com/searchhi...

You don't even need a GMail account or be signed in to test this: if you see Jar-Jar then you've seen the bug. Jar-Jar is drawn in the XMLdoc onload, and we won't even try to load that doc if we think we're somewhere other than Google. The PoC attack may not succeed unless you're logged on to GMail but the bug we're fixing is visible regardless.
In a fixed version you should get a blank page as mentioned in [comment 27](/show_bug.cgi?id=403331#c27 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sort out jar: behavior on HTTP redirects")
If at some point Google blocks this redirect it will break the testcase. Verify that the redirect still works (such as by demonstrating the bug in a vulnerable version for comparison purposes) before declaring a blank page as an indicator that the bug remains fixed.

This is verified1.8.1.10. Running a 2.0.0.9 build with a gmail account that I made, I can see Jar Jar. If I run this in 2.0.0.10 RC1, I get a blank page.

For what it's worth, an uncaught JS exception makes a mochitest fail anyway. If you want the more informative message here that's fine, but if you want to you could take the try/catch out altogether.
r=bzbarsky with the is() nit; either way on the other stuff.

# Web Mayhem Firefox's JAR Protocol issues

Wed, 07 Nov 2007 00:51:46 GMTby
[pdp](/members/pdp.html)

One of the things that we enjoy the most, here at GNUCITIZEN, is finding issues in features. Unlike bugs, insecure features tend to be more severe and usually last longer due to uneasy and rather long decision making process on whether the feature should be continued or discontinued once and for all. In my previous post I [outlined](/blog/bugs-in-the-browser-firefoxs-data-url-scheme-vulnerability) some of my concerns about the `data:` protocol. Today, I would like to draw your attention on the insecurities that come with my personal favorite: `jar:`.

For those of you who have never heard of `jar:`, the protocol is nothing more but a mechanism for pulling content from compressed files. In its most basic usage form, the `jar:` protocol looks like this:

```
jar:**[url to archive]**!**[path to file]**

Notice that the protocol embeds another URL in its body. This URL points to the location of the JAR(ZIP) archive from where the **[path to file]** will be read. The secondary URL can be of any kind, including but not only: chrome, file, ftp, https and even data (we will come back to this one latter). The **[path to file]** parameter usually starts with slash (/). This part of the URL specifies the relative path from the JAR root. In case we have a single file called `a.jpg` within the folder `Pictures`, the path will look like this: `/Pictures/a.jpg`. The full URL path may look like the following:

jar:**https://domain.com/path/to/jar.jar**!**/Pictures/a.jpg**
```

If you want to learn more about the `jar:` protocol just look it up on the web. One thing that is very important to stress, and which we are going to use as a basis for the rest of this post, is that `jar:` content run within the scope/origin of the secondary URL. Therefore, a URL like this: `jar:https://[example](https://chatbotkit.com/examples).com/test.jar!/t.htm`, will render a page which executes within the origin of `https://example.com`. It is very important to remember that.

"What does this all mean?" In simple terms, it means that any application which allows upload of JAR/ZIP files is potentially vulnerable to a persistent Cross-site Scripting. Potential targets for this attack include applications such as web mail clients, collaboration systems, document sharing systems, almost everything that smells like Web2.0, etc, etc, etc. Document formats are in particular very vulnerable. The OpenOffice file format (`odt`) and the less known Microsoft Office 2007 Open Document Format are both based on ZIP. If you create a simple document via either of these products and then you change the extension to `.zip`, you will be able to read all the files the document is made of. An attacker can simply add a malicious page, with a nasty client-side exploits, inside the archive and change back the extension to `.odt` or `.doc`. Who would have though that?

> Once the malicious `Zip/Doc/Odt/Etc/Etc/Etc` file is uploaded/shared the attacker will be able to cross-script the origins in whatever way he likes. My research led to the discovery of many applications that are affected by this issue including some coming from top software vendors such as Google and Microsoft. Their number is so big that it makes almost no sense to try to list them all here or even be bothered to individually investigate all of the related issues in detail. The root cause is only one: the `jar:` URL protocol handler.

But this is not all! Jar URLs can be used to obfuscate malicious payloads to an extend which no Anti-virus software can recognize. The protocol handler can be nested (jars within jars within jars) and can encapsulate the `data:` protocol as well. Attackers can easily write a self extracting payload which is hidden behind multiple permutations of the both `jar:` and `data:` protocols and as such evade intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms that might be on place to guard the perimeter.

### What shall we do to protect ourselves?

I haven't thought well on this yet but the best way is to very carefully sanitize the types of files you allow your users to upload/share. Unfortunately, sometimes this is impossible, especially when it comes to formats such as `.odt` and `.doc`. You need to open these files and re-save them and as such to guarantee that there are no malicious leftovers. IDS, IPS and Ant-virus vendors should really start looking into how the `jar:` protocol works and come up with dynamic mechanism for uncompressing deeply nested URLs.

This could probably also be used to avoid protocol blacklists which blacklits data: URIs as well to avoid XSS filters, and not just IDS'.![severity](//gravatar.com/avatar/cfdf261e761cbfc46f2484abfc3218fa?s=256&d=retro)severityI get document.domain = null with: jar:http://example.com/1.zip!/1.html![Gustavo Bittencourt](//gravatar.com/avatar/189ea272538720c3222cc9b2aae1a6cc?s=256&d=retro)Gustavo BittencourtThe bug 369814 became public after your disclosure.

Moreover, if an archive contains dynamic content such as Flash or HTML, which are vulnerable to attacks, attackers will be able to use them for their benefit.![firefox](//gravatar.com/avatar/82e83802592a7461af6aedf1a7d991fc?s=256&d=retro)firefoxwonderful,i like this blog![Wisec](//gravatar.com/avatar/b33219b8c01e7bf5e352d614e26916cb?s=256&d=retro)WisecNice find Pdp! Even if you discovered it independently, in Bugzilla.Mozilla.org, the developers found this issue on Fabruary 2007 (with a p0c too)! I think it's unbelievable that such high impact issues take so much time to fix!!
Just a suggestion to Moz-Devs:
At least as a quick and dirty fix, add in about:config a flag option which prevents remote site to use data: and jar: and chrome: and whatever. One option for each proprietary/odd uri scheme.
oh, standards answers like "use noscript" will be redirected to /dev/null.
Again kudos to Pdp :)![Giorgio Maone](//gravatar.com/avatar/290e868e00e8429bf1624a461b8ef81e?s=256&d=retro)Giorgio MaoneHi pdp,
Latest NoScript development build took a quite drastic but reasonable (considering the behavior of other browsers) measure about JARs.
JAR resources can still be loaded as images, applet classes and the like, but they cannot be loaded as documents.
http://noscript.net/getit#devel![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpgood news as always! :) 10x Giorgio.![G-Brain](//gravatar.com/avatar/870419564f7ebe6cb4f631e98e14e5dd?s=256&d=retro)G-BrainVery, very nice. Another place to use this kind of thing would be a forum that allows attachments.![Sam St-Pettersen](//gravatar.com/avatar/c2cb44abc9ad1c998cfe344160f76b21?s=256&d=retro)Sam St-PettersenMaybe a local file restriction would be sensible. From my understanding, the only (justified) legitimate use for jar: is in Firefox extensions or XULRunner applications.
Allowing their use in an online context can probably be avoided without any real backlash. Of course, I might be wrong. But I've only seen jar: used legitimately for the aforementioned purposes.![Sam St-Pettersen](//gravatar.com/avatar/c2cb44abc9ad1c998cfe344160f76b21?s=256&d=retro)Sam St-PettersenBTW Is that a photograph of a young(er) Brenden Eich? :)![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpheh, I don't know but it would be funny if it is :)![Kibitz](//gravatar.com/avatar/20d78c987cda1fec614e63ce857aa44d?s=256&d=retro)KibitzRegarding the nested jars within jars within jars that could contain a virus or other payload: what about A/V that scans at runtime? There are still lots of other considerations to be made, but this may be one small consolation to the huge list of issues that this discovery makes.![.mario](//gravatar.com/avatar/89886495b27cfdc78593e1f5c8810594?s=256&d=retro).marioReading the mozilla.org bug lists is like a Saturday noon shopping session ;)
Anyway - as a developer you must \_never\_ trust user input especially when coming to uploads.
1. Check MIME Type
2. Check image size
3. Check for HTML/PHP like patterns in the images source (http://phpfi.com/274478)
4. Transform the image (other size AND other format)
5. Finally place the image in the upload folder
Greetings,
.mario![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdp.mario yes, but I would like to stress one more time: any file can be used to carry the attack. Even TXT file can do the job. So for example, let's say that your application allows export of documents as TXT files. This is a potential problem.![Kishor](//gravatar.com/avatar/8646bd4e904762c599e11665cc67f158?s=256&d=retro)KishorNice! as always..![beford](//gravatar.com/avatar/513bd234e89071690de6ddad6c11cbab?s=256&d=retro)befordpdp, this can also be abused if the site has an open redirect issue, I've posted a simple poc on my site. This makes the amount of 'now' vulnerable sites bigger :)![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpbeford, I wrote a new post just for you :) very nice find!![Peter da Silva](//gravatar.com/avatar/caaefeae15811188de49e613614c32ff?s=256&d=retro)Peter da SilvaI see a few other issues here.
First, there's a problem in the basic design of the handler. Conceptually, the file is not accessed through a "jar:" protocol, the fact that the file can contain content is an attribute of the file. It's the MIME type of the file that should result in the file being treated as a JAR file:
http://example.com/path/to/file.jar#/path/inside/jar/file.html...
This would have avoided this problem right from the start.
Second, allowing arbitrary access to the contents of untrusted archives in any context is dangerous. Apple's been burned by this, Microsoft's been burned by this. What is the benefit of this handler that makes the risk worthwhile?
Third: assuming this is allowed, the file should be treated as part of the directory tree of the hosting site. If it's redirected, that's the site in the redirect, not the site in the original URL. Are there other situations in Firefox where the original URL rather than the redirected URL are used for this purpose?![opera11](//gravatar.com/avatar/943a78f7f3deac36033688f95c4a889e?s=256&d=retro)opera11It is interesting issue :) Good, that i dont use FF :)))![sanjuro](//gravatar.com/avatar/b6202ccdf0d30afd1d3eff7e9270b455?s=256&d=retro)sanjuroNever heard of that "jar:" protocol. I wonder if this issue has been fixed by Google, Microsoft and everyone else since this post.![corrector](//gravatar.com/avatar/344c9a2663aaab035315b8dac9277901?s=256&d=retro)corrector"Never heard of that â€œjar:â€ protocol. I wonder if this issue has been fixed by Google, Microsoft and everyone else since this post." Hug? What is this nonsense all about? There is not/was not, "a Google, MS and every one else" bug. There is (was) an awful, ridiculous, crazy, MS-sh\*tware-style exploit-invitation-by-design FF obscenity. No one needs to fix anything except Mozilla. Someone needs to be fired, and that someone is actually so many people. FF credibility is ruined \*forever\* (or until this team is fired for good).

Package        : iceweasel
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-5947 CVE-2007-5959 CVE-2007-5960

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Iceweasel web
browser, an unbranded version of the Firefox browser. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-5947

    Jesse Ruderman and Petko D. Petkov discovered that the URI handler
    for JAR archives allows cross-site scripting.

CVE-2007-5959

    Several crashes in the layout engine were discovered, which might
    allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-5960

    Gregory Fleischer discovered a race condition in the handling of
    the "window.location" property, which might lead to cross-site
    request forgery.

The Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution (sarge) are no longer
supported with with security updates.

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.10-0etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.10-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.
