Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5960:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a race condition in how Firefox (and related products like Iceweasel, Seamonkey, etc.) handles the `window.location` property in JavaScript.
- When a script sets the `window.location` property to navigate to a new URL, the browser is supposed to set the `Referer` header of the new request based on the address of the content that initiated the script. Instead, due to a timing issue, the `Referer` was sometimes set to the address of the window or frame where the script was running.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Race Condition:**  A timing window exists during the execution of JavaScript where the Referer header can be incorrectly associated with the new location instead of the original one.
- **Referer Spoofing:** Attackers can manipulate the `Referer` header by exploiting the timing issue when setting `window.location`, specifically using techniques like a modal `alert()` dialog, to suspend the script until after the attacker's content has been replaced by the intended referring page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  By generating a fake `Referer` header, attackers can bypass CSRF protections that rely solely on the `Referer` header. This allows attackers to make unauthorized requests on behalf of a user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker hosts a web page with malicious JavaScript.
- **JavaScript Manipulation:** The malicious JavaScript uses `window.location` along with a modal dialog (`alert()`) to create the race condition and spoof the `Referer` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote:** The attacker can be located anywhere, as the attack is delivered through a web page.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to be tricked into visiting the malicious page.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in multiple browsers based on the Mozilla engine (Firefox, Iceweasel, Seamonkey).
- The fix involves using the principal (the security context associated with the code that's running) to get the correct `Referer` URL instead of relying on the JSContext's (execution context) information. This ensures that the header is based on the context where the script initiated the navigation, not the context of the new page.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Gregory Fleischer.
- The fix for this issue was included in:
    - Firefox 2.0.0.10 and later
    - Seamonkey 1.1.7 and later
    - Xulrunner 1.8.0.14-pre071019c-0etch1
    - Iceweasel 2.0.0.10-0etch1
    - Various other distribution updates such as those from Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE and Gentoo.
