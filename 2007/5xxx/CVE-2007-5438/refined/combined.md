How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### 3. Problem Description

I Security Issues

a. Setting ActiveX killbit
Starting from this release, VMware has set the killbit on its
ActiveX controls. Setting the killbit ensures that ActiveX
controls cannot run in Internet Explorer (IE), and avoids
Microsoft KB article 240797 and the related references on this
topic.
Security vulnerabilities have been reported for ActiveX controls
provided by VMware when run in IE. Under specific circumstances,
exploitation of these ActiveX controls might result in denial-of-
service or can allow running of arbitrary code when the user
browses a malicious Web site or opens a malicious file in IE
browser. An attempt to run unsafe ActiveX controls in IE might
result in pop-up windows warning the user.
Note: IE can be configured to run unsafe ActiveX controls without
prompting. VMware recommends that you retain the default
settings in IE, which prompts when unsafe actions are
requested.
Earlier, VMware had issued knowledge base articles, KB 5965318 and
KB 9078920 on security issues with ActiveX controls. To avoid
malicious scripts that exploit ActiveX controls, do not enable
unsafe ActiveX objects in your browser settings. As a best
practice, do not browse untrusted Web sites as an administrator
and do not click OK or Yes if prompted by IE to allow certain
actions.
VMware would like to thank Julien Bachmann, Shennan Wang, Shinnai,
and Michal Bucko for reporting these issues to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2008-3691, CVE-2008-3692,
CVE-2008-3693, CVE-2008-3694, CVE-2008-3695, CVE-2007-5438, and
CVE-2008-3696 to the security issues with VMware ActiveX controls.

b. VMware ISAPI Extension Denial of Service

The Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) is
an API that extends the functionality of Internet Information
Server (IIS). VMware uses ISAPI extensions in its Server product.
One of the ISAPI extensions provided by VMware is vulnerable to a
remote denial of service. By sending a malformed request, IIS
might shut down. IIS 6.0 restarts automatically. However, IIS 5.0
does not restart automatically when its Startup Type is set to Manual.
VMware would like to thank the Juniper Networks J-Security
Security Research Team for reporting this issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-3697 to this issue.

c. OpenProcess Local Privilege Escalation on Host System

This release fixes a privilege escalation vulnerability in host
systems. Exploitation of this vulnerability allows users to run
arbitrary code on the host system with elevated privileges.
VMware would like to thank Sun Bing from McAfee, Inc. for
reporting this issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-3698 to this issue.

f. VMware Consolidated Backup (VCB) command-line utilities may expose sensitive information

VMware Consolidated Backup command-line utilities accept the user
password through the -p command-line option. Users logged into the
ESX service console or into the system that runs VCB could gain
access to the username and password used by VCB command-line
utilities
when such commands are running.
The ESX patch and the new version of VCB resolve this issue by
providing an alternative way of passing the password used by VCB
command-line utilities.
VCB in ESX
----------
The following options are recommended for passing the password:
1. The password is specified in /etc/backuptools.conf
(PASSWORD=xxxxx), and -p is not used in the command line.
/etc/backuptools.conf file permissions are read/write only
for root.
2. No password is specified in /etc/backuptools.conf and the
-p option is not used in the command line. The user will be
prompted to enter a password.
ESX is not affected unless you use VCB.
Stand-alone VCB
---------------
The following options are recommended for passing the password:
1. The password is specified in config.js (PASSWORD=xxxxx), and -p
is not used in the command line. The file permissions on config.js
are read/write only for the administrator. The config.js file is
located in folder "config" of the VCB installation folder. For
example,
C:\Program Files\Vmware\Vmware Consolidated Backup Framework\config.
2. The password is specified in the registry, and is not specified in
config.js, and -p is not used in the command line. Access to the
registry key holding the password is allowed only to the
administrator.
The location of the registry key is:
On Windows x86: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\VMware, Inc.\
VMware Consolidated Backup\Password
On Windows x64: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\
VMware, Inc.\VMware Consolidated Backup\Password
3. The password is not specified in the registry, and is not
specified in
config.js, and -p is not used in the command line. The user will be
prompted to enter a password.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-2101 to this issue.

g. Third Party Library libpng Updated to 1.2.29

Several flaws were discovered in the way third party library
libpng handled various PNG image chunks. An attacker could
create a carefully crafted PNG image file in such a way that
it causes an application linked with libpng to crash when the
file is manipulated.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2007-5269 to this issue.
NOTE: There are multiple patches required to remediate the issue.

##### II ESX Service Console rpm updates

a. update to bind

This update upgrades the service console rpms for bind-utils and
bind-lib to version 9.2.4-22.el3.
Version 9.2.4.-22.el3 addresses the recently discovered
vulnerability in the BIND software used for Domain Name
resolution (DNS). VMware doesn't install all the BIND packages
on ESX Server and is not vulnerable by default to the reported
vulnerability. Of the BIND packages, VMware only ships bind-util
and bind-lib in the service console and these components by
themselves cannot be used to setup a DNS server. Bind-lib and
bind-util are used in client DNS applications like nsupdate,
nslookup, etc.
VMware explicitly discourages installing applications like BIND
on the service console. In case the customer has installed BIND,
and the DNS server is configured to support recursive queries,
their ESX Server system is affected and they should replace BIND
with a patched version.
Note: ESX Server will use the DNS server on the network it is
on, so it is important to patch that DNS server.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-1447 to this issue.
