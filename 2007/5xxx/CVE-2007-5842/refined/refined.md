Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5842:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in Vortex Portal 1.0.42.
*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `cfgProgDir` parameter in `secure.php` and `checklogin.php` scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes external files based on user-controlled input without proper sanitization or validation.
*   `register_globals` is ON.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can include a malicious remote file, potentially leading to:
    *   Arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   Compromise of the web server and the application.
    *   Data theft and manipulation.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited through the HTTP GET method by manipulating the `cfgProgDir` parameter.
*   Specifically, the vulnerable scripts are:
    *   `/path/admincp/auth/secure.php?cfgProgDir=`
    *   `/path/admincp/auth/checklogin.php?cfgProgDir=`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server hosting Vortex Portal 1.0.42.
*   The attacker needs to control a remote server where the malicious script to be included resides.

**Additional details:**

*   The exploit was published on milw0rm.com on 2007-11-04.
*   The vulnerability is specific to Vortex Portal 1.0.42.
*   The `register_globals` being enabled is a factor that increases the risk associated with the RFI vulnerability.
