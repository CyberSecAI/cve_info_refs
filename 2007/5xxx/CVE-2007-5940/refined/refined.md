{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2007-5940",
    "description": "The feynmf.pl script creates a temporary \"properly list\" file at the location \"$TMPDIR/feynmf$PID.pl\", where $PID is the process ID.",
    "root_cause": "Insecure temporary file creation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The script uses a predictable temporary file name based on the process ID."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could create symbolic links in the directory where the temporary files are written, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem that is writable by the user running Feynmf. When Feynmf writes the temporary file, the target valid file would then be overwritten with the contents of the Feynmf temporary file.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local symlink attack"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user who has the ability to create symbolic links in the directory where the temporary files are created by Feynmf, and have knowledge of where the temporary files are created."
