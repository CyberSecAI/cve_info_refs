Subject: opens /tmp/vobcopy.bla insecurely, symlink attack
Date: Sat, 27 Oct 2007 22:25:27 -0400
```
[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=448319;msg=5) (text/plain, inline)]
```
```
Package: vobcopy
Version: 0.5.14-2
Severity: important
Tags: security

vobcopy -q opens /tmp/vobcopy.bla insecurely:

open("/tmp/vobcopy.bla", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND|O_LARGEFILE, 0666) = 2

Similarly, vopbcopy -v -v opens /tmp/vobcopy_0.5.14.log insecurely:

open("/tmp/vobcopy_0.5.14.log", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND|O_LARGEFILE, 0666) = 2

Since there's no O_EXCL /tmp/vobcopy.bla can already exist as a symlink
and will be followed, appending to an arbitrary file. Thankfully it is
an append, so there's no direct data loss. The log files also tend to be
empty so the best attack I can think of ATM is that If vobvopy is run as
root, it can at be used to create /etc/nologin.

The fix is simply to open the file with O_EXCL, or better, to use
a standard, safe temp file function. (Which would have the benefit of
also making it respect the TMPDIR environment variable.)

Hi Steffen,
* Steffen Joeris <steffen.joeris@skolelinux.de> [2007-12-07 19:29]:
> Any update on this?

Nope. I had not yet the time to look into a prospective
patch. A quick look at the source revealed that the code is
pretty bad and it would be some work to integrate this in a
clean way. I contacted the upstream author a while ago and
it seemed like he fails to see that this is a security bug,
so I guess we have to really write a patch on our own.
Kind regards
Nico

I'm working on it. Time is short though so it might take another week.
I think about moving the place of the logfiles to the home of the calling user,
are there any objections agains this?

Maybe I should upload 1.0.2, at least to get it into the debian system.
I want to get the bugs closed in their system!

Cant the log files just be placed in the current working directory?
Either way, it sounds good.

That would be the same problem if you call vobcopy in a
world-writable directory. Checking if the file already
exists and creating a unique name using mkstemp or opening the
file with O_EXCL should be enough. Of course its also an
option to place them in the users home directory.
Kind regards

Point taken.  Let me ask this, is there any real value in either -q or
-v -v opening a log file at all?  Does it serve any useful purpose
since it is so easy to redirect stderr from the command line.

Perhaps the simple solution is just to remove these features from
vobcopy?

Robos ... what do you think?

This does not seem like an option to me too because vobcopy
is using stderr and stdout, I doubt the average user can
redirect those streams in the shell.

hmmm .. its not difficult to redirect (1>filea 2>fileb) or to combine
(2>&1).  But would the *average* user be collecting this information in
the first place?

Another option would be to send error data to stdout instead of stderr.
Does a two output stream (stdout/stderr) have any use with vobcopy?

Warm regards,

Steve

From my short read of the man pages I got the impression that O_EXCL was not
a posix feature. If so, it would limit vobcopy from running on not-posix
conformant platforms (whatever they may be...)

Bad idea, especially with -q. Vobcopy let's you redirect the output to
stdout, in order to pipe it to e.g. mplayer or bbtools. It would be kind of
bad if the progress bar also ended up in mplayer, don't you think :)

And -v -v is there for the convenience of the bug-reporter. I got emails
from people that simply said "your program told me to send you this, here
you go". I doubt that they could have redirected stdout or err...

> Robos ... what do you think?

Loosing those options is not possible IMHO.

Where did you read this cause it is of course valid in
POSIX. Just have a look at man 3p open.

# Vobcopy: Insecure temporary file creation — GLSA **200803-11**

Vobcopy uses temporary files in an insecure manner, allowing for a symlink
attack.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/vobcopy** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.0** |

### Background

Vobcopy is a tool for decrypting and copying DVD .vob files to a hard
disk.

### Description

Joey Hess reported that vobcopy appends data to the file
"/tmp/vobcopy.bla" in an insecure manner.

### Impact

A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct symlink
attacks and append data to arbitrary files with the privileges of the
user running Vobcopy.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Vobcopy users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/vobcopy-1.1.0"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
