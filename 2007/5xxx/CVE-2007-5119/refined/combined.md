How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Application: JSPWiki Multiple Vulnerabilities
Version: 2.4.103 and 2.5.139
Credit: Jason Kratzer
Date: 9/24/2007
Background
------------------------------------------------------------
JSPWiki is wiki software built around the standard J2EE components of
Java, servlets and JSP. It was written by Janne Jalkanen and released
under the LGPL. The Sun Java System Portal Server includes it as one
of its core applications. It is primarily used for company intranets
and has an active developer community, also including the i3G
Institute of the Heilbronn University.
(Courtesy of Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSPWiki)
Description
------------------------------------------------------------
Multiple Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities have been discovered
within the JSPWiki application, successfully allowing an attacker to
steal credentials, falsify posts, and persistently deface portions of
the site. Additionally, a Local Path Disclosure vulnerability was
also discovered.
Affected Versions
------------------------------------------------------------
Each vulnerability was confirmed in versions 2.4.103 and 2.5.139-beta.
The Cross Site Scripting vulnerability affecting the redirect
parameter is only found in version 2.5.139-beta.

Notes:
The non-existent number must be between 1 and 10 character
otherwise a standard 500 error will be displayed.
Vendor Notification
------------------------------------------------------------
The JSPWiki project was notified on September 10, 2007. Janne
Jalkanen developed and implemented a fix by September 18, 2007.
Remediation
------------------------------------------------------------
It is recommended to upgrade to JSPWiki version 2.4.104. It is also
worth noting, the above vulnerabilities have also been fixed in the
