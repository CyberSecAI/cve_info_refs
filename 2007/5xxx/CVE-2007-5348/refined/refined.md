    "summary": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that GDI+ handles gradient sizes. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user browses to a Web site that contains specially crafted content.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer overrun when GDI+ improperly processes gradient sizes handled by the vector graphics link library.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer overrun"
    ],
