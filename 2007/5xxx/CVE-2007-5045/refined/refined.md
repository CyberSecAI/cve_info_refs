{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A vulnerability in the QuickTime plugin allowed it to launch the default browser with arbitrary parameters when processing specially crafted media files. This was due to QuickTime directly appending the 'qtnext' value to the browser's executable path, bypassing the registered command-line template and security mechanisms.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation/sanitization by QuickTime when launching the default browser.",
      "Use of the -chrome command-line option in Firefox to execute arbitrary javascript code with elevated privileges."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user by enticing them to open a malicious media file. This could lead to malware installation, data theft, or system corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted QuickTime media-link files with a malicious 'qtnext' attribute.",
      "The user's default browser being Firefox or another browser susceptible to command-line injection attacks."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious .mov file that contains the malicious qtnext parameter, and the victim needs to use a vulnerable version of Firefox."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "mitigation": "The vulnerability was mitigated in Firefox by disabling the execution of arbitrary script via the `-chrome` command-line option. Firefox now uses a whitelist of schemes allowed with -chrome, preventing command injection of code. The fix also blacklists the javascript: and data: URI schemes.",
     "alternative_mitigation": "Disabling the QuickTime plugin or using NoScript extension could mitigate the issue. Uninstalling QuickTime would prevent the exploit.",
    "related_bugs": "The bug report mentions related bugs, specifically [bug 384384](/show_bug.cgi?id=384384), which was related to a similar vulnerability involving command line injection. Also bug 396196 was created to cover the idea of launcher/wrapper program to avoid this kind of problem in the future. The report also mentions bug 396228 as a related issue for a QuickTime crash.",
    "platforms_affected": "Primarily Windows systems were affected, although the vulnerability could potentially be exploited on other platforms where QuickTime and a vulnerable browser are installed. MacOS was not affected as Quicktime on MacOS would launch the system's default browser.",
    "quicktime_flaw": "QuickTime reads the .html file association from the registry and launches the browser directly, ignoring the actual registered command-line template, appending the \"qtnext\" value without using ShellExecute() or similar. QuickTime should have been using ShellExecute() or validating the scheme against a whitelist.",
    "defense_in_depth": "The discussion in the bug report also highlights the need for defense in depth, addressing the issue on the Firefox side instead of solely relying on QuickTime to fix their bug."
