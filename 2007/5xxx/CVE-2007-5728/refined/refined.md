**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   The application is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   The vulnerability occurs because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `PHP_SELF` variable, before using it in the output.

*   The attacker needs to manipulate the `PHP_SELF` variable, likely through crafted URLs or HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpPgAdmin application.
*   No special privileges or local access are required for exploitation.

**Summary:**

CVE-2007-5728 is an XSS vulnerability in phpPgAdmin that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts via the `PHP_SELF` variable. This can lead to the execution of malicious code in the context of the user's browser.
