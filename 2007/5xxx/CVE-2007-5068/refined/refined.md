Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5068:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw.
*   The vulnerability lies in the `index.php` file of the phpFullAnnu (PFA) 6.0 application.
*   The application directly uses user-supplied input from the `$_GET['mod']` parameter in a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input validation/sanitization.
*   The application retrieves the `h_title` from the `heading` table, using the `mod` parameter from the URL directly in the SQL query.
*   The vulnerable code is:
    ```php
    $sqltitle = $bdd->readresult($bdd->request('SELECT h_title FROM '.$tbprefix.'heading WHERE h_mod = \''.$_GET['mod'].'\''));
    ```
*   The injected SQL query is reflected in the page title, which can be seen in the title bar.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database. The provided exploit demonstrates how to extract admin login credentials using `UNION ALL SELECT concat(a_login ,0x3a,a_password) FROM pfa_admin`.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection could potentially allow attackers to modify data, escalate privileges, or gain control over the database server, depending on the database setup and application privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request that manipulates the `mod` parameter.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `mod` parameter within the URL is the entry point for the injection.
*   Example of a vulnerable URL: `http://www.site.com/[path]/?lang=fr&mod=login' UNION ALL SELECT concat(a_login ,0x3a,a_password) FROM pfa_admin/*`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SQL to craft the malicious queries.
*  **magic_quotes_gpc=Off:**  The exploit only works with `magic_quotes_gpc` set to off, which is a PHP configuration.

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit is specific to phpFullAnnu (PFA) 6.0.
* The provided exploit can be used to extract the admin usernames and passwords.
* The vulnerable code is in `index.php` and the affected part is in the meta.inc.php file where the title is rendered
*   The vulnerability was identified on September 22, 2007.
*   The exploit was published on September 23, 2007.
