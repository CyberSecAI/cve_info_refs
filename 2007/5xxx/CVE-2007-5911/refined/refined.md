```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Stack-based buffer overflow in the AxMetaStream.dll ActiveX control.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The ActiveX control contains multiple methods that accept string parameters and are vulnerable to buffer overflows when an overly long string (greater than 6999 characters) is passed. The vulnerable methods are: BroadcastKey(), BroadcastKeyFileURL(), Component(), ComponentClassID(), ComponentFileName(), ExtraProperty(), Properties(), RequiredVersions(), Source(), and XMLText().
- Impact of exploitation: Denial of service (crashes the application). Arbitrary code execution is also possible but not specifically mentioned in this content.
- Attack vectors: By passing an overly long string as an argument to the vulnerable methods via a crafted HTML page.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to convince the user to visit a malicious web page with the vulnerable ActiveX object. The user needs to have the vulnerable Viewpoint Media Player installed.
