{
  "CVE-2007-5623": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `check_snmp` plugin within Nagios Plugins when parsing the output of the `snmpget` command.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow. Improper bounds checking in the check_snmp plugin when handling SNMP GET replies.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Nagios by sending specially crafted SNMP responses.",
       "Attack vectors": "By sending a specially crafted SNMP \"GET\" reply to the Nagios daemon.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send network packets to the server running Nagios. No authentication is required."

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow was identified in the `check_snmp` module of the Nagios Plugins package.",

      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can trigger a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable version of Nagios plugins.",
      "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send crafted snmpget replies to the Nagios monitoring system.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send network packets to the server running Nagios and trigger a check of a vulnerable service."
