Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-5587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `secdrv.sys` driver, which is part of the Macrovision SafeDisc copy protection. The driver incorrectly handles configuration parameters passed to it. Specifically, it does not properly validate the input buffer when using `METHOD_NEITHER` for I/O control codes (IOCTLs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `secdrv.sys` driver fails to validate the input buffer provided by user-mode applications when processing IOCTLs using `METHOD_NEITHER`. This allows attackers to send arbitrary data without checks, leading to potential memory corruption.
*   **Direct Memory Overwrite:** The driver copies data from the user-supplied input buffer to the output buffer using `rep movsd` and `rep movsb`. Because the input buffer isn't validated, an attacker can control both the source and destination of this memory copy operation and achieve memory overwrite, including overwriting kernel memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain elevated privileges on the system, potentially achieving SYSTEM level privileges.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By controlling the memory overwrite, attackers can execute arbitrary code with system privileges.
*   **Full System Control:** With SYSTEM privileges, an attacker can install programs, view, change or delete data, and create new accounts with administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the target machine.
*   **Malicious Application:** The attacker must execute a specially crafted application that sends a malicious IOCTL request to the `secdrv.sys` driver.
*   **Exploitation of IOCTL:** The attacker leverages the lack of input validation in the driver's IOCTL handling to achieve memory corruption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker requires a valid user account on the targeted Windows system to be able to execute the malicious application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must have knowledge of how the vulnerability functions in order to construct the malicious input buffer and the necessary IOCTL calls.
*   **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code, which can be achieved through a variety of methods after a local logon.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.
*   A patch (version 4.3.86.0 of secdrv.sys) was made available by Macrovision and Microsoft to address the vulnerability. Both patches contain the same fix, but have different build times.
*   The vulnerability was actively being exploited in the wild.
*   A workaround for the vulnerability was available by disabling the `secdrv.sys` driver in the registry, however, this would impact any programs that relied on this driver such as games using SafeDisc copy protection.
*   Microsoft Security Bulletin MS07-067 provides comprehensive details about the vulnerability and its resolution.
