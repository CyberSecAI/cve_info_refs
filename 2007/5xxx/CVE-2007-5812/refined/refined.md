- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization in the `DownloadModule.php` script. It allows an attacker to manipulate the `file` parameter to perform path traversal.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information such as configuration files or source code.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a manipulated `file` parameter containing path traversal sequences, like `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, and know the path of the target file.
