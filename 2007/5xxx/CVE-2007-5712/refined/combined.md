## Security fix released

Posted by **Jacob** on Oct. 26, 2007

Today we're releasing a fix for a security vulnerability discovered in
Django's internationalization framework. The complete details are below,
but the executive summary is that you should updated to a fixed version
of Django immediately.

We are releasing point-releases of all affected Django versions. You can
download them at <http://www.djangoproject.com/download/>. Those tracking
trunk development should "svn update" as soon as possible.

Please direct any questions about this release to django-users
(<http://groups.google.com/group/django-users>).

#### Description of vulnerability

A per-process cache used by Django's internationalization ("i18n") system to
store the results of translation lookups for particular values of the HTTP
Accept-Language header used the full value of that header as a key. An
attacker could take advantage of this by sending repeated requests with
extremely large strings in the Accept-Language header, potentially causing a
denial of service by filling available memory.

Due to limitations imposed by Web server software on the size of HTTP header
fields, combined with reasonable limits on the number of requests which may
be handled by a single server process over its lifetime, this vulnerability
may be difficult to exploit. Additionally, it is only present when the
"USE\_I18N" setting in Django is "True" and the i18n middleware component is enabled[\*](#note-1). Nonetheless, all users of affected
versions of Django are encouraged to update.

#### Affected versions

* Django trunk prior to revision [6608].
* Django 0.96
* Django 0.95 (including 0.95.1)
* Django 0.91

#### Resolution

New versions of Django containing this fix have been released today which
alter this caching mechanism to store shortened, normalized values and to
reject improperly formatted headers.

These versions are called:

* Django 0.96.1 (replaces Django 0.96)
* Django 0.95.2 (replaces Django 0.95.1)
* Django 0.91.1 (replaces Django 0.91.1)

Anyone using a stable Django release should upgrade to one of these point
releases immediately. These fixed versions have already been provided to
maintainers of Django packages for various OS distributions and should be
released shortly.

Anyone tracking Django's trunk development should use Subversion to update
to at least revision [6608].

Additionally, these fixes have been committed to the various "bugfixes"
branches:

* <http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/branches/0.91-bugfixes/>
* <http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/branches/0.95-bugfixes/>
* <http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/branches/0.96-bugfixes/>

*\** This post originally failed to mention that the i18n middleware component must be enabled to trigger the bug.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : python-django
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-3909 CVE-2007-5712
Debian Bug     : 497765 448838

Simon Willison discovered that in Django, a Python web framework, the
feature to retain HTTP POST data during user reauthentication allowed
a remote attacker to perform unauthorized modification of data through
cross site request forgery. The is possible regardless of the Django
plugin to prevent cross site request forgery being enabled. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this issue as
CVE-2008-3909.

In this update the affected feature is disabled; this is in accordance
with upstream's preferred solution for this situation.

This update takes the opportunity to also include a relatively minor
denial of service attack in the internationalisaton framework, known
as CVE-2007-5712.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.95.1-1etch2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
