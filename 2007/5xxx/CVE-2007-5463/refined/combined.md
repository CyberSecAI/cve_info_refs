Hello,
We would like to announce that we have released a patch of ideal\_process.php after release 3.3 beta has been issued.
There was a vulnerability which permitted a site visitor to view paths to certificates and private key of the merchant for the iDEAL payment gateway.
All releases including 3.3 beta are vulnerable.
A new 3.3 version will have a fixed version of the script.
Therefore, please download a fixed version of the file from here: http://www.viart.com/downloads/ideal\_process-3.3.zip
More info on this issue can be found here: http://www.viart.com/ideal\_process\_script\_fix\_for\_release\_32\_and\_33\_beta
.html
With kind regards,
ViArt Team

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Topic Information

| ViArt Team (Guest) ViArt Team (Guest) | | 8 Oct 2007 8:00 PM | | --- | | Brief. We have made a fix of ideal\_process.php after release 3.3 beta has been issued.   Description. There was a vulnerability that allowed site visitor to know paths to certificates and private key of the merchant for iDEAL payment gateway. All releases including 3.3 beta are vulnerable. Version 3.3 which will be released after this post is published has this script already fixed.   Solution. Please download updated version of the file from here <http://www.viart.com/downloads/ideal_process-3.3.zip> Then extract files into the folder 'payments' of your shop replacing existing one. Don't forget to make a backup copy of existing file in case something will go wrong.  Last modified: 8 Oct 2007 8:00 PM | |

| Eugene (Guest) Eugene (Guest) | | 9 Oct 2007 9:21 AM | | --- | | Hi,   iDEAL process script fix can be applied for release 3.2 and 3.3 beta fluently. For all other older releases it may work too but you should thoroughly test it before using in live mode.   WBR, ViArt Support Team | |

| SajMalik SajMalik | | 9 Oct 2007 10:12 AM | | --- | | Hello Eugene   Forgive my ignorance - I am a marketing person and not as experienced in this area as many users.   I have two questions:   1: If I do not [ever] propose to use iDEAL for checkout I presume I can simply delete it?   2: Is this how the hacker inserts the code and will deleting this file, therefore, solve the problem for me?   Thanks, Chris | |

| Eugene (Guest) Eugene (Guest) | | 9 Oct 2007 1:18 PM | | --- | | Hi,   Here are some more clarifications.   The fix of payments/ideal\_process.php was issued to prevent iDEAL payment module to compromise iDEAL merchant's certificates and key if they are accessible via HTTP protocol. It doesn't give an opportunity to upload a malicious code to your web site.   So the answers to your question are: 1. If you don't expect to use any payment, shipping or some other module you can just remove it from web server. 2. The script ideal\_process.php doesn't allow hacker to insert the code, so removing of the script won't effect your problem in any case.   WBR, ViArt Support Team | |
