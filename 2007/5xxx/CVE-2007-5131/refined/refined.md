Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `catId` parameter of the `index.php` script in ActiveKB. This parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing for unauthorized database access and manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as user emails, passwords, and potentially other confidential data.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):**  The `LOAD_FILE` function in the second provided exploit shows that an attacker can attempt to read server-side files, which, if successful, could lead to further compromise of the system.
- **Database Manipulation:** Beyond reading data, an attacker could modify or delete database content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious SQL queries within the `catId` parameter of a GET request to `index.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft effective injection attacks.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Application:** ActiveKB NX 2.x (Powered by ActiveKB Knowledgebase Software)
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `catId`
*   **Exploit Location:** `/kb/index.php` or `/faq/index.php`
*   **Exploit Example 1:** `http://www.xxx.net/kb/index.html?ToDo=browse&catId=-20+union+select+1,concat(email,0x3a,password,0x3a,userid),3,4,5,6,7+from+user--`
    * This example attempts to retrieve email, password, and user ID from the user table using a `UNION SELECT` statement.
*   **Exploit Example 2:** `https://www.xxx.com/faq/index.php?ToDo=browse&catId=-10+union+select+1,LOAD_FILE(0x2f6574632f706173737764),3,4,5,6,7+members/*`
    * This example attempts to read the `/etc/passwd` file using the `LOAD_FILE` SQL function.
