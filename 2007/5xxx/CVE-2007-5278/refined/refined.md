{
  "cve": "CVE-2007-5278",
  "description": "Zomplog <= 3.8.1 is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload. The /admin/upload_files.php script does not check if the user is an admin, and it only checks MIME types, not file extensions, allowing for the upload of malicious PHP scripts. Uploaded files are stored in the /upload directory with a name composed of the date, a random number, and the original filename, which can be accessed or bruteforced if directory listing is disabled.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `/admin/upload_files.php` script does not enforce proper authentication to verify if the user is an admin. Additionally, the script only validates the MIME type of the uploaded file, not the file extension.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass",
      "Unrestricted file upload",
      "Insufficient file extension validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code (e.g., a PHP shell) on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Direct access to `/admin/upload_files.php` via HTTP POST request.",
      "Bypassing MIME-type check by providing a valid MIME type and malicious php code"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable script and have knowledge of the target's directory structure"
  }
