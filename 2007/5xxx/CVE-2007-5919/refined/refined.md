Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5919:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure storage of FTP passwords in a plain text file named `pass.txt` within the `mwftp/pass/` directory. This file is directly accessible via a web browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** Passwords are not hashed or encrypted but stored in a predictable location.
- **Information Disclosure:** The `pass.txt` file containing the password hashes is accessible via a web browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the FTP server by cracking the MD5 hash stored in `pass.txt` and using it to login.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct URL access:** An attacker can directly access the `pass.txt` file through a web browser, using the URL `http://site.com/path/mwftp/pass/pass.txt`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know the URL path to the vulnerable file.
- No authentication is needed to access the `pass.txt` file.
- The attacker would need to perform MD5 hash cracking to obtain the plaintext password from the stored hash.

**Additional details:**
- The information suggests that the discovered vulnerability is in MyWebFTP.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- The vulnerability has a high risk level.
- The CVSS base score is 5/10 with a high exploitability score of 10/10 and partial confidentiality impact.
- The vulnerability is associated with CWE-264 (Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls).
