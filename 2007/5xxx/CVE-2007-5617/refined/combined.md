# shadow: Privilege escalation — GLSA **200606-02**

A security issue in shadow allows a local user to perform certain actions
with escalated privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-apps/shadow** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.15-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.15-r2** |

### Background

shadow provides a set of utilities to deal with user accounts.

### Description

When the mailbox is created in useradd, the "open()" function does
not receive the three arguments it expects while O\_CREAT is present,
which leads to random permissions on the created file, before fchmod()
is executed.

### Impact

Depending on the random permissions given to the mailbox file
which is at this time owned by root, a local user may be able to open
this file for reading or writing, or even executing it, maybe as the
root user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All shadow users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/shadow-4.0.15-r2"
```

# BIND: Denial of service — GLSA **200702-06**

ISC BIND contains two vulnerabilities allowing a Denial of Service under
certain conditions.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-dns/bind** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **9.3.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **9.3.4**revision >= **9.2.8** |

### Background

ISC BIND is the Internet Systems Consortium implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocol.

### Description

An unspecified improper usage of an already freed context has been
reported. Additionally, an assertion error could be triggered in the
DNSSEC validation of some responses to type ANY queries with multiple
RRsets.

### Impact

A remote attacker could crash the server through unspecified vectors
or, if DNSSEC validation is enabled, by sending certain crafted ANY
queries.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time for the first issue. The
DNSSEC validation Denial of Service can be prevented by disabling
DNSSEC validation until the upgrade to a fixed version. Note that
DNSSEC validation is disabled on a default configuration.

### Resolution

All ISC BIND 9.3 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/bind-9.3.4"
```

All ISC BIND 9.2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/bind-9.2.8"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# VMware Workstation and Player: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200711-23**

VMware guest operating systems might be able to execute arbitrary code with
elevated privileges on the host operating system through multiple flaws.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-workstation** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.5.5.56455**= **6.0.0.45731** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.5.5.56455** |

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-player** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.5.56455**= **2.0.0.45731** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.5.56455** |

### Background

VMware Workstation is a virtual machine for developers and system
administrators. VMware Player is a freeware virtualization software
that can run guests produced by other VMware products.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in several VMware
products. Neel Mehta and Ryan Smith (IBM ISS X-Force) discovered that
the DHCP server contains an integer overflow vulnerability
(CVE-2007-0062), an integer underflow vulnerability (CVE-2007-0063) and
another error when handling malformed packets (CVE-2007-0061), leading
to stack-based buffer overflows or stack corruption. Rafal Wojtczvk
(McAfee) discovered two unspecified errors that allow authenticated
users with administrative or login privileges on a guest operating
system to corrupt memory or cause a Denial of Service (CVE-2007-4496,
CVE-2007-4497). Another unspecified vulnerability related to untrusted
virtual machine images was discovered (CVE-2007-5617).

VMware products also shipped code copies of software with several
vulnerabilities: Samba (GLSA-200705-15), BIND (GLSA-200702-06), MIT
Kerberos 5 (GLSA-200707-11), Vixie Cron (GLSA-200704-11), shadow
(GLSA-200606-02), OpenLDAP (CVE-2006-4600), PAM (CVE-2004-0813,
CVE-2007-1716), GCC (CVE-2006-3619) and GDB (CVE-2006-4146).

### Impact

Remote attackers within a guest system could possibly exploit these
vulnerabilities to execute code on the host system with elevated
privileges or to cause a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All VMware Workstation users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/vmware-workstation-5.5.5.56455"
```

All VMware Player users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/vmware-player-1.0.5.56455"
```
