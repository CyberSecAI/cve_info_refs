Package: ircii-pana
Version: 1:1.1-1
Severity: important
Tags: security

During looking into #443544 I stumbled into another security issue in ircii-pana
in bitchx' hostname command.
The e_hostname function (commands.c) uses tmpnam to create a temporary file which is
known to be insecure.

From commands.c
2620 char filename[81];
2621 char comm[200];
2622 FILE *fptr;
2623 char *p = NULL, *q;
[...]
2635 tmpnam(filename);
2636 #if defined(_BSDI_VERSION) && _BSDI_VERSION < 199701
2637     if (!(p = path_search("netstat", "/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin")))
2638     {
2639         yell("No Netstat to be found");
2640         return;
2641     }
2642     sprintf(comm, "%s -in >%s", p, filename);
2643 #elif defined(__EMX__)
2644 sprintf(comm, "netstat -a > %s", filename);
2645 #else
2646     if (!(p = path_search("ifconfig", "/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin")))
2647     {
2648         yell("Can't find ifconfig");
2649         return;
2650     }
2651                 sprintf(comm, "%s -a >%s", p, filename);
2652 #endif
2653     system(comm);

This code creates a "unique" file name in line 2635 using the insecure tmpnam
function, copies a netstat command which redirects its output to filename into
the comm buffer and then executes comm with system in line 2653.

This would enable local users to overwrite arbitrary files of the user running
bitchx and invoking the hostname command via a symlink attack.

We really should remove bitchx, the code is really bad and it seems to be unmaintained
upstream.

Kind regards
Nico

Subject: ircii-pana has been removed from Debian, closing #449149
Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2008 23:16:00 +0200
```
Version: 1:1.1-5+rm

The ircii-pana package has been removed from Debian testing, unstable and
experimental, so I am now closing the bugs that were still opened
against it.

For more information about this package's removal, read
<http://bugs.debian.org/451373> . That bug might give the reasons why
this package was removed, and suggestions of possible replacements.

Don't hesitate to reply to this mail if you have any question.

Thank you for your contribution to Debian.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Security issues and bugs have been reported, but upstream work seems to have stalled leaving bitchx in a state where there are known problems without official (or in some cases any) fixes.  The most secure course of action is to remove bitchx from the system and switch to using a supported IRC client.  We have not compiled a complete list of open issues in BitchX, but here are a few that we know about:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3360   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4584   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5839   Package removal instructions: +---------------------------+  Remove the package as root: # removepkg bitchx  Some admins may also want to add a symlink to another console IRC client such as irssi to help users migrate:  cd /usr/bin ln -sf irssi BitchX   +-----+  Slackware Linux Security Team http://slackware.com/gpg-key security@slackware.com  +------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | To leave the slackware-security mailing list:                          | +------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Send an email to majordomo@slackware.com with this text in the body of | | the email message:                                                     | |                                                                        | |   unsubscribe slackware-security                                       | |                                                                        | | You will get a confirmation message back containing instructions to    | | complete the process.

| [Description](#c0)  Hanno Böck   gentoo-dev  2002-04-18 05:52:19 UTC  ``` When I try to make "emerge fte", I get an error that some X11-files are missing e.g. con_x11.cpp:34: X11/Xatom.h: No such file or directory ..  Ebuild brings an error.  Maybe you should split fte (like in debian) in fte-console, and fte-xterm ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Seemant Kulleen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-18 11:09:52 UTC  ``` I have not looked at it closely enough yet, but likely that this can depend on the X use flag, so with use X, you get the xterm and console versions, and without that flag set you only get the console version.  I do not know for sure just yet, but I will investigate. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Seemant Kulleen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-18 20:34:29 UTC  ``` Actually, looking at the ebuild it already does what I suggested.  So, one must ask -- do you have the Xatom.h file on your system? And if so, where? ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Seemant Kulleen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-27 14:48:33 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 2154](show_bug.cgi?id=2154 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - cannot build FTE with X support") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Seemant Kulleen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-27 17:30:24 UTC  ``` How odd that x11 wasn't listed as an optional dependency.  Ah well that has been fixed.  Thanks for the catch and the fix, folks :)  Sorry for the inconvenience. ``` |  |

# BitchX: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200807-12**

Multiple vulnerabilities in BitchX may allow for the remote execution of
arbitrary code or symlink attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-irc/bitchx** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.1-r4** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

BitchX is an IRC client.

### Description

bannedit reported a boundary error when handling overly long IRC MODE
messages (CVE-2007-4584). Nico Golde reported an insecure creation of a
temporary file within the e\_hostname() function (CVE-2007-5839).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to connect to a malicious IRC
server, resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application. A local attacker could
perform symlink attacks to overwrite arbitrary files on the local
machine.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Since BitchX is no longer maintained, we recommend that users unmerge
the vulnerable package and switch to another IRC client:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "net-irc/bitchx"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
