The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the processing of beacon frames. This can be exploited via a specially crafted beacon frame with an overly large \"length\" value (greater than 15) in the extended supported rates element (\"xrates\").  Successful exploitation causes the driver to exit and results in a kernel panic.  The vulnerability is reported in version 0.9.3.2. Other versions may also be affected.

It is stable and has an established userbase. The driver itself\nis open source but depends on the proprietary Hardware Abstraction Layer\n(HAL) that is available in binary form only.\nVulnerability overview:\n---------------\nA specially crafted beacon frame causes the driver to exit(), leading to\na kernel panic on the affected machine. An attacker could crash client\nmachines that are listening for beacons using a fake access point.\nVulnerability details:\n---------------\nIn short, the driver exits (via the BUG() macro) if a beacon frame with\na high length value (>15) in the extended supported rates element is\nreceived. This leads to a kernel panic.\n>From net80211/ieee80211\\_scan\\_sta.c: 217 static int sta\\_add(...):\nKASSERT(sp->rates[1] <= IEEE80211\\_RATE\\_MAXSIZE,\n(\"rate set too large: %u\", sp->rates[1]));\nmemcpy(ise->se\\_rates, sp->rates, 2 + sp->rates[1]);\nif (sp->xrates != NULL) {\n    /* XXX validate xrates[1] */\n    KASSERT(sp->xrates[1] <= IEEE80211\\_RATE\\_MAXSIZE,\n            (\"xrate set too large: %u\", sp->xrates[1]));\n    memcpy(ise->se\\_xrates, sp->xrates, 2 + sp->xrates[1]);\n} else\n    ise->se\\_xrates[1] = 0;\nIEEE80211\\_RATE\\_MAXSIZE is defined as 15.
