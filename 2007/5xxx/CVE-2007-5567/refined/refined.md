Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an insecure `require_once` statement in the `upload_config.php` file of the Galmeta Post application.
*   The `$DDS` variable, which is not defined within the code snippet, is prepended to the path, and it appears this variable is attacker controlled. This allows for Remote File Inclusion (RFI).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include a remote file by manipulating the `$DDS` variable.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the value of `$DDS` before using it in the `require_once` statement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can include a malicious PHP script from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete control of the web server and potentially the underlying system, including data theft, defacement, and further attacks on connected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker would manipulate the `$DDS` parameter (likely in a GET or POST request) to point to a malicious PHP file hosted on an attacker-controlled server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable server.
*   **Understanding of the Vulnerable Application:** Basic understanding of how parameters can be manipulated to include files via HTTP requests.
*   **Ability to host a malicious file:** The attacker needs to host a malicious file on a server accessible by the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

* The included `.htaccess` rewrite rule does not provide protection against this RFI because it only handles URLs without periods, and the RFI attack could include a full URL to bypass it.
