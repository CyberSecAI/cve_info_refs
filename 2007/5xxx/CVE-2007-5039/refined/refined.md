Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is related to the improper implementation of System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) hooks in various security software drivers. Specifically, the issue is within how these drivers intercept and handle system calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper SSDT Hooking:** The software products listed implement SSDT hooks, which are used to intercept and modify system calls. The vulnerability lies in the flawed implementation of these hooks, leading to potential system instability and exploitable conditions.
*   **BSOD (Blue Screen of Death):** The flawed implementations can trigger a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), indicating a serious system failure, when the hooks are not handled correctly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **System Instability:** Exploitation leads to a BSOD, making the system unusable until restarted.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While not explicitly stated, the faulty hook implementation could potentially be further exploited by an attacker to gain more control over the system by manipulating the hooked function. However, this is speculation, the content provided only specifies the BSOD impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attacks:** The vulnerabilities can be triggered locally, suggesting an attack can be performed by an attacker who already has access to the machine.
*   **Remote Attacks:** The text indicates a "Remote: Yes", which means remote attacks are possible, though details about how this would occur aren't in this content.  The remote possibility, combined with the flawed system call handling, suggests the attacker could potentially trigger the vulnerability through a remote interaction (e.g. via a malicious payload or network traffic), although the specifics are not included in the text.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:**  An attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target system to directly trigger the flawed driver functions or manipulate the system in a way that would cause the BSOD.
*   **Remote Access:** If the remote attack vector is the one used, then the attacker would need to have a way to remotely interact with the target system.

**Software Affected:**

The following software products were found to be vulnerable:

*   BlackICE PC Protection 3.6.cqn
*   G DATA InternetSecurity 2007
*   Ghost Security Suite beta 1.110 and alpha 1.200
*   Kaspersky Internet Security 7.0.0.125
*   Norton Internet Security 2008 15.0.0.60
*   Online Armor Personal Firewall 2.0.1.215
*   Outpost Firewall Pro 4.0.1025.7828
*   Privatefirewall 5.0.14.2
*   Process Monitor 1.22
*   ProcessGuard 3.410
*   ProSecurity 1.40 Beta 2
*   RegMon 7.04
*   ZoneAlarm Pro 7.0.362.000

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content links to advisory and article pages on the Matousec website for more details, which could have further information on how to exploit or prevent the vulnerability.
*   The content also mentions a 'BSODhook' utility that can be used to find similar vulnerabilities, suggesting the issue is widespread across security software at the time.

**In summary, the vulnerability lies in the flawed implementation of SSDT hooks in various security software drivers, leading to system instability and potential for exploitation via local and possibly remote attack vectors. This vulnerability is related to CVE-2007-5039.**
