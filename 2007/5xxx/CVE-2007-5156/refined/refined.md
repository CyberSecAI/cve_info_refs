Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2007-5156:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an insecure file upload mechanism in the `upload.php` script of the FCKeditor file manager, specifically how it handles file extensions.
*   The script uses both allowed and denied extension lists, but the logic and default configuration allow for bypassing the intended restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Extension Filtering:** The script attempts to validate uploaded files based on allowed and denied file extensions. However, this check is flawed:
    *   It extracts the extension by finding the last dot (`.`) in the filename, which can be easily bypassed by appending extra characters or dots (e.g., `shell.php.he.ll`).
    *   The script does not sanitize the file name before processing it or during the file save operation.

*   **Inadequate File Type Checking:** The script checks the 'Type' parameter in the query string to determine whether the file is a 'File', 'Image', 'Flash', or 'Media'.  However, this check is insufficient to prevent malicious uploads if a valid type is provided but the file itself is malicious.

*   **File Overwrite:** The script checks for existing files and uses a counter to rename it. However, this can be bypassed if the upload is performed from a location that is outside the application's file system.

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** After uploading, the script uses `chmod( $sFilePath, 0777 )` to make the uploaded files executable. This is overly permissive and introduces a significant security risk as it allows anyone to execute the uploaded file on the web server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a file with a manipulated filename containing PHP code (e.g., `shell.php.he.ll`), an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Full Server Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary code on the server can lead to complete control over the compromised system. This can be used to steal data, modify websites, install backdoors, or perform any other malicious activity.
*   **Data Breach:** Once the attacker gains access to the server, they can potentially steal sensitive information from the database and other locations.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker can modify website contents.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `upload.php` script, including a file with a manipulated filename and malicious PHP code.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The file is sent using the `multipart/form-data` encoding, as part of the file upload process.
*   **Query Parameter:** The `Type` parameter of the request is set to a valid value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server to send the HTTP request.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The provided exploit code doesn't indicate any authentication is required to upload the malicious file.
*   **Knowledge of Path:** The attacker must know the path to the vulnerable `upload.php` script within the application's directory structure.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to upload a PHP shell, then use it to execute system commands on the server.
*   The exploit code uses a technique to extract the file url after a successful upload.
*   The exploit attempts to connect on TCP port 80 of the target machine.
*   The information was extracted from multiple sources such as exploit-db.com, dev.fckeditor.net and waraxe.us.
*   The vulnerability was present in Lanius CMS, SyntaxCMS, and likely other applications using vulnerable versions of FCKeditor.
*   The issue was addressed by switching to a whitelist approach in the default configuration and unifying the allowed extensions in FCKeditor.

This vulnerability allows for remote, unauthenticated file upload and arbitrary code execution. It constitutes a high severity vulnerability.
