How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Change "black list" to "white list" in the default connector configurations

| Reported by: | [Frederico Caldeira Knabben](/query?status=!closed&reporter=fredck) | Owned by: | [Wiktor Walc](/query?status=!closed&owner=wwalc) |

| Priority: | [Normal](/query?status=!closed&priority=Normal) | Milestone: | [FCKeditor 2.5 Beta](/milestone/FCKeditor%202.5%20Beta "Completed 17 years ago (Oct 10, 2007, 9:00:00 PM)") |
| Component: | [File Browser](/query?status=!closed&component=File+Browser) | Version: |  |
| Keywords: |  | Cc: |  |

### Description

Currently, we are using the "DeniedExtensions" setting for all connectors to define the list of denied extensions in all File Browser connectors.

It is a fact that it is quite hard to maintain this "black list", making it easy to miss something that could result in security issues. It would be much more sane to maintain a "white list", using the "AllowedExtensions" setting instead.

I'm sure many people will start complaining that this and that extensions will be missing, but this is configurable anyway, and would certainly make our security attempts more efficient.

I ask here for **suggestions for the list** of extensions we should be included in this "white list".

I don't want to copy all the extensions from that site (for example):
[​http://www.file-extensions.org/extensions/common](http://www.file-extensions.org/extensions/common)
so I'll just write which groups I consider as most important:

* Microsoft/Open Office documents
* documents of any other type (txt, rtf, pdf and so on)
* archives
* multimedia files (audio, images)

Extensions of this type should go into "files" group by default.

The question is how detailed the list might be. The more extensions we provide by default, the less users would have to adjust config file.

Replying to [wwalc](/ticket/1325#comment:1 "Comment 1"):

> The question is how detailed the list might be. The more extensions we provide by default, the less users would have to adjust config file.

The more, the better, but we should not include things like .001 or .bib. Let's come with generic, but useful, things.

The important is not including security sensible things.

I digged through files on my computer and these also seems to be common:

```
Audio and music files
.mpc   > MusePack Audio file
.wav   > WAVe PCM Sound, standard Windows sound format
.wma   > Windows Media Audio

Flash:
.swf   > ShockWave Flash, Animated vector format for the Internet

There is one group I forgot about - video files (new group?).
.asf   > Advanced Streaming Format
.avi   > Audio Video Interleave movie
.mov   > Apple QuickTime Movie file, standard Macintosh video format
.mpg   > MPEG 1 video file format
.mpeg  > MPEG movie
.wmv   > Windows Media Video File

```

However video files are generally large, so don't know if they need to be on the list by default.

I think that people will ask about the support for video files, and I would add the .flv (flash video) to the pack.

I haven't included video files because of their usual large size, but there was no "for security" motivation for it, so we should include them.

I think we can go ahead compiling the list with our propositions, and move it to the code.

Applied with [[973]](/changeset/973 "Fix for #1325 changed black list to white list approach, unified list ...") and [[975]](/changeset/975 "Fix for #1325 part two: added missing .fla extension to file and media type").

ASP and CFM connectors had extended list of media files, so I included additional extensions found there: qt, ram, rm, rmi, rmvb.

I'm not closing it yet because I don't know if it has been applied also to .aspx (?).

Great job Wiktor!

ASP.NET is treated separately. We can close this one now.

Sorry for not reading it better the changeset before, but I don't think that some of the changes are right:

1. in the Image category the psd, tif and tiff extensions have been allowed, yes, they are images, but I don't think that they work without a plugin in any browser, so it seems strange that the users can upload a file from the image dialog and select it, but then it won't work.

2. I still don't know where the "Media" type is used in FCKeditor.

3. I've said this somewhere else, but allowing the use of .fla files in the flash dialog is pointless. Those .fla files are just the seed, the .c files of an .exe, and when you distribute a program you don't distribute the source. If you want to do it, you add them as "File" (and probably zipped with other stuff).

4. There is another bug about adding .flv and .as to the allowed extensions for flash, this could be the right time to change it (and I only mean to add .flv from the flash dialog as they will be used from a .swf movie and they need to be in the same folder unless it's specially coded)

5. (and last) the fckconfig.js file is lacking these changes, so the user might be able to start the upload but then get an error from the server saying that the extension isn't allowed and they have wasted some time waiting for the upload to finish.

### [comment:11](#comment:11) Changed [17 years ago](/timeline?from=2007-10-17T21%3A33%3A10Z&precision=second "See timeline at Oct 17, 2007, 9:33:10 PM") by Wiktor Walc

You are absolutely right, I agree.

2. just one thing - I think we could get a lot of questions from people wondering why Media folder disappeared

1,3,4. So to summarize:

* remove psd, tif, tiff from Images
* remove .fla from Flash
* add .as and .flv to Flash, Files

correct?

5. I definitely forgot about this. I wish it was possible to configure the whole FCKeditor using only one single file, that would be great :)

### [comment:12](#comment:12) Changed [17 years ago](/timeline?from=2007-10-18T14%3A04%3A58Z&precision=second "See timeline at Oct 18, 2007, 2:04:58 PM") by Alfonso Martínez de Lizarrondo

The media issue is just something that I wanted a little discussion about. In the current setup I don't think that it's used anywhere, so there are some questions about what's its use.

As soon as an "insert media" dialog is available, then it's obvious its utility, but for the moment I don't think that it's really useful, but this could be handled in another bug ([#1430](/ticket/1430 "#1430: Task: Remove the \"Media\" type in the filemanager (closed: wontfix)")) to discuss it better as it isn't really related to the changes in this bug.

The fourth point from my point of view is only to add .flv, not the .as (due to the same reasons that 3)

Single file configuration: we can try to move to that approach little by little, I suggested in another bug that the server integration files should take care to configure the js paths for the file manager automatically.

Thanks Wiktor.

Ok, fixed with [[1041]](/changeset/1041 "Fix for #1325, corrected black/white list approach + fixed some typos ...").

I've just noted that there is such a nice feature like spell checker in Eclipse :-) so I fixed also some typos in comments.
