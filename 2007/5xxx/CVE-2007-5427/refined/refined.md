Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the search functionality of Joomla!, specifically in the `searchword` parameter. The provided URL (`http://site/index.php?option=com_search&searchword=';alert('XSS')//`) demonstrates how user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in the search results page. This leads to a DOM-based XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- DOM-based XSS: The vulnerability exists because the JavaScript code on the client side directly manipulates the DOM using the unsanitized data from the URL.
- Lack of input sanitization: The Joomla! search functionality doesn't adequately sanitize or encode the `searchword` parameter before using it in the search results.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact of the vulnerability is an XSS attack. This can lead to:
   - Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
   - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
   - Redirecting the user to malicious sites.
   - Defacing the website.
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
- The initial exploit is limited due to character limits, only allowing for basic actions like displaying an alert message. However, it's mentioned that if the character limit is removed, more extensive XSS attacks would be possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript in the `searchword` parameter.
- The user needs to be tricked into clicking the malicious link or visiting a page containing this link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious URL with XSS payload.
- The attacker doesn't need any privileges on the Joomla! site itself, simply knowledge of the vulnerable parameter.
- The attacker needs to get a user to interact with the malicious URL (through social engineering, or other means).

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is a DOM-based XSS, meaning the payload executes on the client side.
- The vulnerability is present in Joomla! version 1.0.13, but may exist in other versions as well.
- The exploitation of the vulnerability is not immediate, it requires the user to change the number of search results to one page.
- The exploit is limited initially due to a limitation on the length of the search parameter, but more extensive attacks become possible if this limitation is removed.
