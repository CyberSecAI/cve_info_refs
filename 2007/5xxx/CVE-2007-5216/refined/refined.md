{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses variables to construct file paths in require_once statements without proper sanitization, leading to Remote File Inclusion (RFI).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a remote file, potentially containing malicious code, allowing for arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the $cfg_vcard_path, $cfg_pear_path, or $cfg_phpmailer_path variables to point to a malicious remote file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the values of the mentioned configuration variables, which are used in the vulnerable 'require_once' statements."
