{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes files using a variable `$toroot` which is not sanitized, leading to potential Remote File Inclusion (RFI).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, leading to full compromise of the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `$toroot` variable, likely through user-controlled input or parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `$toroot` variable, likely through an HTTP request."
