How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Release Notes for ChironFS 1.1.1

June 21, 2008

This is the second beta release of the new Chiron FS 1.1 code
base. There is one known bug right now. It is the bug related
with massive delete described below. There is a fix for it,
but it is still in experimental status. Until now, no one has
reported failures related to this bug. If you find any bugs,
please report them asap, with as many details as you can:
what you were doing, what you have installed in the system,
the command line you invoked ChironFS, your current directory,
etc.

Bugs fixed since ChironFS 1.1.0:

* ChironFS could not locate the correct place where chirctl was
  when called using the environment variable $PATH to find it.
  Now chirctl is called in the same way as ChironFS, leaving
  this work to $PATH searches.

Changes

Since ChironFS 1.1.0

* ChironFS could not locate the correct place where chirctl was
  when called using the environment variable $PATH to find it.
  Now chirctl is called in the same way as ChironFS, leaving
  this work to $PATH searches.

Since ChironFS 1.0.0

* Added the --ctl (or -c) option which allows to mount a pseudo-filesystem
  (like /proc) to control the behavior of the Chiron filesystem being mounted.
  Currently, it's only possible to show the status of the replicas and change
  their status. Dynamically generated nagios plugin scripts are provided too.
* Updated the howto in the chapter 5, explaining the use of the --ctl option.

Since ChironFS 1.0RC9

* Integrated patch sent by Antti Kantee, porting ChironFS to NetBSD.
* Integrated patch sent by Yen-Ming Lee, porting ChironFS to FreeBSD.
* Changed the debug code on \*BSD versions to get the same system information
  that Linux version gets. It is needed because the next ChironFS release
  will need that info in order to resynchronize failed replicas.
* The version naming convention: now ChironFS will use a Linux Kernel like
  versioning scheme. So, the upcoming version 1.1.x will be the development
  version of the upcoming 1.2.x stable one.

Since ChironFS 1.0RC8

* Fixed [bug #8](http://code.google.com/p/chironfs/issues/detail?id=8)
  where an unprivileged user was being able to touch a file which it did not have
  the rights to write. Thanks to Neal Becker for reporting it.
* Fixed a readlink bug, where the number of bytes of the linked filename was being
  wrong reported.
* Fixed function access, the access were not being checked against the ruid and rgid
  of the caller process, but of the mounting user.
* Fixed a memory leak bug.

Since ChironFS 1.0RC7

* Fixed a bug reported by email by Patrick Chevalier, where ChironFS
  was giving wrong error message when the mount point path did not
  existed. Thanks to him for the report.
* Fixed [bug #7](http://code.google.com/p/chironfs/issues/detail?id=7) where ChironFS wasn't being specific in the error message.
  Thanks to Alexandre Fernandes for reporting it.
* Fixed a bug reported by email by Graham Toal where the hash address of
  the file descriptor table could be a negative number. The hash table
  function was changed to the Robert Jenkins' 32 bit integer hash function
  as found in this [Twang's doc](http://www.concentric.net/~Ttwang/tech/inthash.htm) just adapted to the C language. The 64 bit mix function was taken
  from there too. The size of the hash table was changed too it was a waste of memory
  allocating a table of file-max size because file-max is a system wide parameter
  and if all the file-system would be ChironFSed and with a minimal of two replicas
  we would need only 33% of the table space. Since the new hash functions are much
  better distributed and are good enough until 80% of the space used, then I
  decided to use a file-max proportional allocation, using the maximum power of 2
  less than 50% of file-max. The stats showed a low collision rate for 50% of table
  usage (about 18% of file-max in my box, which means that, using two replicas,
  I was using 54% of the system file descriptors). I drew an allocation graphic
  which can be seen in the [howto](http://www.furquim.org/chironfs/howto.html#stats)
* Fixed a bug where a chunk of memory was being freed two times (and crashing
  ChironFS, but it was going exit anyway) when some replica path didn't existed
  at mount time.
* Fixed an issue when the ulimit were lower than the projected hash table size, just
  raising the ulimit value, but it only works if the mounting user is root, otherwise
  the ulimit must be raised through manual configuration of /etc/security/limits.conf.
* Updated the howto with hash, file descriptor and ulimit considerations.

Since ChironFS 1.0RC6

* Fixed [bug #6](http://code.google.com/p/chironfs/issues/detail?id=6) where files created by another user than the user
  that mounted ChironFS were owned by the mounting user and not
  the creator itself. It was a serious security problem. ChironFS
  was not tracking the creation of the files and, this way, was
  not changing the ownership of the created file/directory to the
  uid and gid of the calling process. Now ChironFS calls fuse\_context
  to get that info from the calling process and changes to it
  right after the creation. Thanks to Neal Becker who reported
  the bug.
* Implemented an experimental fix for a bug reported by Oleg Bartunov
  by e-mail, where ChironFS fails to exclude all files when doing
  massive delete ("rm -Rf" on directories with thousands of files).
  It happens when a cycle of opendir/readdir/closedir cannot be done
  in only one call due to lack of space in the readdir buffer and
  subsequent calls were lacking of synchronization because the system
  flushed the deletes and updated the directory list. I started to
  call seekdir using the offset parameter of the readdir. This
  parameter were being ignored until now as in the example programs
  of fuse implementations. Now my tests are succesfull. But, Franco
  Broi reported at the fuse-devel mailing list that a filesystem he
  is implementing got the same bug. I told him about my fix and he
  tested with his filesystem and it did NOT work for him. Miklos
  Szeredi, the author of fuse proposed another fix and it worked for
  Franco Broi. But when I implemented it in ChironFS, it made my
  system crash. Franco Broi told me that his filesystem runs on top
  of NFS. I did not tested ChironFS over NFS, but my fix worked on
  top of SSHFS. So, I will keep my fix, but in experimental status.
  Thanks to Oleg Bartunov for reporting the bug.
* Complete rewrite of the debug function. The old ones were a confusing
  mess. Now there is only one, accepting variable parameters. Thanks
  to Graham Toal, author of dupfs, from whose code I learnt the
  techniques to do it.
* Fixed a bug when ChironFS is called with --log option and the
  logfile pathname is relative and the file itself doesn't exists.
  In this case, ChironFS was exiting with the "file not found" error.
  The problem is that when realpath is called with a non-existant
  path it returns NULL. So I had to get its basedir, call realpath
  and only then, re-append the basename to it. Thanks to Graham Toal
  who reported this bug.
* Implemented a priorization system, modifying the simple round-robin
  that made the load balance on read operations. Now when we have
  replicas with a too different response time (tipically a local/LAN
  replica and a remote WAN replica) the system focus the load balance
  only in the fast replicas. The slow replicas are accessed in read
  operations only when the fast ones fails. To enable this, the user
  MUST tell ChironFS which are the slower replicas by prefixing the
  pathnames with a colon in the command line, for example:
  "chironfs /real1=:/real2=/real3=/real4=:/real5 /virtual". In this
  example, ChironFS will give priority to the /real1, /real3 and /real4
  and choosing a replica to read using a round-robin load balance
  algorithm. ChironFS will read from /real2 and /real5 replicas only
  if /real1, /real3 and /real4 fail and in this case, will choose
  between /real2 and /real5 unsing the same round-robin algorithm.
  Of course most of its usage will be something like
  "chironfs /real1=:/real2 /virtual", but the example was intended to
  show more details on how ChironFS will handle these situations.
  Thanks to Maxime Ritter who gave the idea of configuring the priority
  in the command line.
* Fixed one more memory leak: I was freeing all paths[i].path allocations,
  but I forgot to free the paths structure itself.

Since ChironFS 1.0RC5

* Fixed a bug with fsync reported both by Oleg Bartunov by e-mail
  "(...) postgresql 8.2.4 doesn't works. initdb worked fine, but
  starting fails (...) PANIC: could not fsync control file: No
  such file or directory (...)" and by William Maddler "(...) I
  try to save a file from Vim. (...) 'test' E667: Fsync failed
  (...) File seems to be saved anyhow. I have no problems using
  nano or echoing to a file.". It was a wrong return value of the
  function giving to the application a false negative.

* Fixed [bug #5](http://code.google.com/p/chironfs/issues/detail?id=5)
  The man page wasn't being copied to the man directory when
  installing from the source tarball. I needed to redo all the
  autoconf/automake/autoheader stuff just to discover that I had
  to put one line at Makefile.am. Anyway, I needed to change the
  .spec file and my script to build all the packages too.

Since ChironFS 1.0RC4

* Fixed [Bug #3](http://code.google.com/p/chironfs/issues/detail?id=3).
  It was a problem with mknod, which can't be called when using sshfs. Instead
  we open and close the file. Thanks to Alexandre Fernandes for reporting this
  bug.

* Fixed [Bug #4](http://code.google.com/p/chironfs/issues/detail?id=4).
  There was a mismatch in readdir function when testing if the replica is
  disabled. I used the wrong index variable. Thanks to Alexandre Fernandes for
  reporting this bug.

* Added lock control and reopening of the log file, so when you logrotate
  there will be no need to restart (remount) ChironFS, and, this way, no
  need to stop all the daemons that uses the ChironFS mounts.

* ChironFS now automatically calls FUSE using the direct\_io option so we avoid
  redundant disk caching

* Fixed wrong error message when a failure occurs calling realpath to canonicalize
  the replica's paths. I was just reporting low memory and so this message was
  being displayed when the path was wrong. Now I display the errno message

* Added --version and -V option to command line.

Since ChironFS 1.0RC3

* [Bug #2](http://code.google.com/p/chironfs/issues/detail?id=2) .
  Thanks to Marek Kotas for reporting this bug.

Since ChironFS 1.0RC2

* Fixing various memory leaks. Thanks to Patrick Prasse who found these
  bugs and sent a patch fixing all of them.
* Fixing bug #1 reported at the project issues page. Look at
  [bug #1](http://code.google.com/p/chironfs/issues/detail?id=1)
  to see the details. Thanks to Marcelo Squeff who found this bug.

Since ChironFS 1.0RC1

* Correcting file permissions at the creation of the log file. It
  was world writable. Thanks to Jason Haar who found this bug.

Since ChironFS 0.5

  + Adoption of a struct to handle all the data about the replicas.
    Version 0.5 just used strings to store the pathname to them. Now
    the system have a status field indicating if it is enabled or
    disabled and the time when it was disabled. The fields with usage
    statistics were been defined but they are not used yet.
  + Some write functions were behaving as read functions: they were
    not writing to all replicas, but to the first available one.
  + Implemented a simple round robin algorithm to load balance the
    read operations. Version 0.5 was reading everything from the
    first replica available.
  + Implemented a logging system. This system does not logs all the
    activity. It logs just when some operation fails but some are
    succesfull. In this case if the operation is a reading operation
    Chiron FS logs but does not disable the replica because the replicas
    are still consistent. But if the operation is for write, then
    Chiron FS logs the failure AND disable the inconsistent replica.
