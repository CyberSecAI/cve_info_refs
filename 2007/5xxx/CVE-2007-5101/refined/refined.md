        "type": "bug_fix",
        "description": "ChironFS 1.1.1 fixed a bug where files created by another user than the user that mounted ChironFS were owned by the mounting user and not the creator itself. ChironFS was not tracking the creation of the files and, this way, was not changing the ownership of the created file/directory to the uid and gid of the calling process.",
        "root_cause": "ChironFS was not correctly tracking file creation and assigning ownership to the mounting user instead of the creator.",
         "weaknesses": [
          "Incorrect file ownership assignment."
         ],
        "impact": "Files created within the ChironFS mount would be incorrectly owned by the mounting user, leading to potential access control issues and data corruption.",
        "attack_vectors": "Local, an unprivileged user creating a file within the ChironFS mount.",
         "attacker_capabilities": "An unprivileged user must be able to write to the mounted file system"

        "description":"ChironFS 1.1.1 implemented an experimental fix for a bug reported by Oleg Bartunov, where ChironFS fails to exclude all files when doing massive delete ('rm -Rf' on directories with thousands of files). It happens when a cycle of opendir/readdir/closedir cannot be done in only one call due to lack of space in the readdir buffer and subsequent calls were lacking of synchronization because the system flushed the deletes and updated the directory list.",
        "root_cause":"Lack of synchronization in handling directory listing when performing massive deletes, causing the system to miss files in the delete operation.",
        "weaknesses":[
          "Incorrect handling of directory listing during massive delete operations"
        ],
        "impact":"Incomplete file deletion during massive deletes. Files would not be deleted properly, data could be exposed",
