Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5991:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied input within the "profile" functionality of ExoPHPdesk. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize or validate input used within a SQL query, leading to a SQL Injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper input validation allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, personal data, or other confidential information.
*   **Data Modification:** Malicious users could modify or delete data stored in the database, leading to data corruption or loss.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database user privileges and the nature of the exploited SQL queries, an attacker might gain elevated permissions within the application.
*   **Denial of Service:** In some scenarios, a successful SQL injection can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) by overloading the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the URL parameter `user` in the `index.php?fn=profile` request to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Direct SQL Injection:** The provided example URL `http://example.com/helpdesk/index.php?fn=profile&s=&user=admin' sql here` explicitly demonstrates direct SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected ExoPHPdesk application.
*   **Basic understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the injection payload.
*   **No authentication required:** The attack is present in the "profile" section and can be exploited without having valid credentials, since it is present on user lookup.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided text indicates this vulnerability is related to an XSS vulnerability (CVE-2007-5990) within the same application's user profile functionality. However, CVE-2007-5991 itself is solely about the SQL injection.
*   The provided text explicitly mentions the vulnerable URL structure and an example showing the injection point within the `user` parameter.
*   The text indicates the risk level as "Medium"
*   The text mentions this is a remote exploit.
