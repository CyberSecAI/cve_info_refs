  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow occurs when opening a specially crafted PageMaker (PMD) file with an overly long font name. The vulnerability is due to a boundary error in MAIPM6.DLL when copying the font name into a fixed-length stack buffer.",

      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
       "Boundary error"

    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a malicious PMD file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PMD file with an overly long font name and convince the user to open it with a vulnerable version of Adobe PageMaker."
