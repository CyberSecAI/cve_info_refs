- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `sbcat_id` parameter in the `searchresult.php` script. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code directly into the database query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `searchresult.php` script.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information, such as admin usernames and passwords, from the database by injecting malicious SQL code.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `sbcat_id` parameter in the `searchresult.php` script via a crafted HTTP GET request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious SQL queries.
