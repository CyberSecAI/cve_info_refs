Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5631:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) issue stemming from the way PeopleAggregator handles file paths. Multiple PHP files within the application improperly handle the `path_prefix` and `current_blockmodule_path` parameters, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary code by specifying a malicious external URL or file path to be included.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The primary vulnerability is the ability to include remote files, which enables the execution of arbitrary code from attacker-controlled servers.
- Unsanitized Input: The `path_prefix` and `current_blockmodule_path` parameters are not properly sanitized, allowing for path traversal or injection of URLs pointing to malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server, granting the attacker full control over the vulnerable web server and its data.
- Complete System Compromise: An attacker could potentially take complete control of the server including data, database, and sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious GET requests to vulnerable PHP files. The attacker includes the malicious payload within the `path_prefix` or `current_blockmodule_path` parameter

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable web server.
- Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters: The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameters (e.g. `path_prefix`, `current_blockmodule_path`) and the vulnerable PHP files.
- Ability to Host Malicious File: The attacker would typically need to have access to a server hosting their malicious code which will be included by the vulnerable server.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is exacerbated when the PHP `register_globals` directive is turned on. However, the vulnerability still exists even with `register_globals` off but might require more precise configuration or payload crafting.
- The exploit was publicly disclosed without prior notification to the developers.
- Patched versions of the software are v1.2pre6-release-55 and higher, and the vulnerable versions are v1.2pre6-release-53 and earlier.
- The exploit-db entry lists over 70 vulnerable files within the PeopleAggregator application.
