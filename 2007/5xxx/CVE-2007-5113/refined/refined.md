        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Authorization bypass"

      "attack_vectors": [
        "By crafting malicious URLs containing JavaScript code that, when visited by a user, is executed within the user's browser.",
        "By manipulating URL parameters (e.g., 'profile', 'rid', 'prefs') to gain unauthorized access to reports."
