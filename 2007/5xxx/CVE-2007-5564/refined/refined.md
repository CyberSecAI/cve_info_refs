Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-5564

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the lack of proper input sanitization in the nssboard software (formerly Simple PHP forum). Specifically:

1.  **Unfiltered HTML when BBcode is disabled:** When BBcode is disabled, the application fails to strip HTML tags from user-provided content, leading to potential injection of malicious HTML.
2.  **Unfiltered profile information:** User profile data, such as real names and emails, is not sanitized, allowing users to inject HTML code directly into these fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTML Injection:** The software is vulnerable to HTML injection attacks due to the lack of filtering on user input. This allows attackers to embed malicious HTML code within forum posts and user profiles.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The ability to inject arbitrary HTML includes the ability to execute scripts, resulting in XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The injected HTML can include JavaScript code, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary scripts within the user's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:**  If XSS is successful, an attacker can steal session cookies which allows them to hijack user sessions and gain unauthorized access to accounts.
*   **Defacement:**  Attackers can alter the appearance of the forum by injecting HTML, affecting user experience and trust.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Forum Posts:** Users can inject HTML code into their forum posts when BBcode is disabled.
*   **User Profiles:** Users can inject HTML code into their profile information (real name, email etc.) fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic user account:** An attacker needs a basic user account to be able to post content or edit their profile.
*   **No special access needed:**  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any user.
*   **Knowledge of HTML and JavaScript:** An attacker needs knowledge of HTML and JavaScript to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was found in version 6.1 of NSSboard, but earlier versions are likely affected.
*   The character limit on profile information limits the damage that can be caused by this particular attack vector.
*   The recommended fix is to filter HTML tags regardless of BBcode settings and to filter user profile input.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by kcghost.
