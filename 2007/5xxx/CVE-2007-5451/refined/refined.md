- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to an insecure `include` statement in the `admin.color.php` file. Specifically, the `$mosConfig_live_site` variable is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject an arbitrary URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The lack of proper sanitization allows attackers to inject malicious code by including a remote file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote file. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, including data theft, defacement, or the installation of backdoors.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted GET request to `admin.color.php` with the malicious URL passed through the `mosConfig_live_site` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have a server where they host their malicious file.
