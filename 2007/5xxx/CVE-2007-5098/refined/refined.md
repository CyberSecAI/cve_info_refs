```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The application uses a variable in a require statement without proper sanitization allowing remote file inclusion.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability exists in multiple files due to insecure use of the set_depth parameter within the require function.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary code execution by including malicious files from a remote server.
- Full compromise of the server.

Attack vectors:
- Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable scripts, using the 'set_depth' parameter to specify the URL of the malicious file.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The 'register_globals' PHP option must be enabled on the server.
- The attacker needs access to a server to host the malicious file to be included.
