Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of `include` or `require_once` statements with a variable path, allowing an attacker to potentially control the included file. This is due to the lack of proper input sanitization or validation of variables used in file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The identified vulnerabilities are Remote File Inclusion (RFI) issues. Specifically, the code uses variables such as `$DIR_ROOT`, `$DIR_PAGE`, and `$lang` within `require_once` and `include` statements. If an attacker can manipulate these variables, they can force the server to include a remote file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these RFI vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
* Execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote file.
* Access sensitive information or internal resources.
* Potentially deface the website.
* Compromise the server and potentially other systems on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves manipulating the `$DIR_ROOT`, `$DIR_PAGE`, and `$lang` variables, likely via query parameters in URLs or other input mechanisms. The specific methods would depend on how the application handles and processes these variables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to:
* Identify the vulnerable parameters.
* Supply malicious URLs to the application through these parameters, where the URL points to a malicious file they control.

**Vulnerable Code Snippets (from the content):**
*   `require_once ($DIR_ROOT . ‘conf/constants.php’);` (File: `tmp/remasys_appli_v0.5/website/global.php`, Line: 8)
*   `include($DIR_PAGE . “$lang/boxAdmin.php”);` (File: `tmp/remasys_appli_v0.5/website/template/fr/page.php`, Line: 26)
*   `include($DIR_PAGE . “$lang/boxConnected.php”);` (File: `tmp/remasys_appli_v0.5/website/page/fr/boxConnection.php`, Line: 16)

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content is from an automated tool that scans for RFI vulnerabilities. The accuracy of the found vulnerabilities has not been verified.
*   The vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization of input variables used in the inclusion of files.
*   The tool was in an "early stadium" at the time of the analysis.

This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, as it provides the specific vulnerable code lines and the context of the RFI vulnerability.
