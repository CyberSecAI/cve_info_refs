Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5787:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Micro Login System v1.0 storing user credentials (usernames and passwords) in a plain text file named `userpwd.txt`. This file is accessible via a direct web request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** Passwords are stored in plain text within the `userpwd.txt` file instead of using proper hashing or encryption methods.
*   **Direct Access to Sensitive File:** The `userpwd.txt` file is not protected and can be accessed directly via a web request, allowing unauthorized users to view its contents.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Password Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to user credentials, including usernames and passwords.
*   **Confidentiality breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive user information can lead to further malicious activities, such as account takeover or data breaches.
*   **Compromise of user accounts:** With stolen credentials, an attacker can log in as legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote File Disclosure:** The attacker exploits the lack of access controls on the `userpwd.txt` file.
*   The attacker accesses the file via a direct HTTP request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker only requires network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** No authentication or special skills are needed to make the web request to access the sensitive file.
*   The attacker does not need to be logged into the application to access the credentials.
