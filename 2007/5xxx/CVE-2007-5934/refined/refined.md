**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The PEAR::MDB2 library, when handling a request to store a URL string as a LOB (Large Object), would treat it as a request to retrieve and store the content of the URL, instead of the URL string itself.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information disclosure:** The vulnerability allows retrieval of sensitive information, including "file://" URLs local to the web server. This could lead to reading of arbitrary files on the server.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application using PEAR::MDB2 could be used as an indirect proxy to access resources not normally accessible to the public, such as internal services behind a firewall.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Attackers can potentially access sensitive files like `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/my.cnf` if the web server is running with sufficient permissions.
-  Attackers can use the web server as an intermediary to probe internal network resources that would otherwise be inaccessible from the outside.
-  Confidential or sensitive information stored in LOBs could be retrieved.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker could inject a malicious URL into a web form field intended for storing blob data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the vulnerable application via a web form that allows storage of LOB values.
- No special privileges or access level is required.
