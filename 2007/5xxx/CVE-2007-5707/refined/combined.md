# OpenLDAP: Denial of Service vulnerabilities — GLSA **200803-28**

Multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities have been reported in OpenLDAP.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-nds/openldap** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.3.41** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.3.41** |

### Background

OpenLDAP Software is an open source implementation of the Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol.

### Description

The following errors have been discovered in OpenLDAP:

* Tony Blake discovered an error which exists within the normalisation of
  "objectClasses" (CVE-2007-5707).
* Thomas Sesselmann reported that, when running as a proxy-caching server
  the "add\_filter\_attrs()" function in servers/slapd/overlay/pcache.c
  does not correctly NULL terminate "new\_attrs" (CVE-2007-5708).
* A double-free bug exists in attrs\_free() in the file
  servers/slapd/back-bdb/modrdn.c, which was discovered by Jonathan
  Clarke (CVE-2008-0658).

### Impact

A remote attacker can cause a Denial of Serivce by sending a malformed
"objectClasses" attribute, and via unknown vectors that prevent the
"new\_attrs" array from being NULL terminated, and via a modrdn
operation with a NOOP (LDAP\_X\_NO\_OPERATION) control.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenLDAP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-nds/openldap-2.3.41"
```
### References

Subject: ldapadd with 'objectClasses' instead of 'objectClass' brings slapd
down
Date: Mon, 03 Sep 2007 11:23:31 +0200
```

Package: slapd
Version: 2.3.30-5
Severity: grave

Hello,

i am used debian etch.

I am wrongly used the misspelling Attribute 'objectClasses' instead of 'objectClass'
in ldapadd and then the slapd dies ...

I have verified this with a new (debian default) installation
with no special things and anonymous ldapadd!

floh@lenny:~$ ldapadd -x
dn: uid=test5,ou=SONST,ou=people,dc=kip.uni-heidelberg,dc=de
objectClasses: top

adding new entry "uid=test5,ou=SONST,ou=people,dc=kip.uni-heidelberg,dc=de"
ldap_add: Invalid syntax (21)
        additional info: objectClasses: value #0 normalization failed

=> now there are no slapd-processes left ... (the slapd process is dead)

floh@lenny:~$ ldapsearch -h ldap uid=test4
ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Can't contact LDAP server (-1)

root@ldap:~# ps -ef |grep slap
root     21036 14161  0 10:30 pts/0    00:00:00 grep slap

Hello,

because of this Bug can easily cause as Denial of Service of the stable LDAP-Server,
i will be happy if you can backport the fix/patch to the stable (etch) release of slapd.

many thanks

2.2.23 (in oldstable) is listed as vulnerable
<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-5707>

and I believe there is still security support for oldstable.

Hello,

how is the status of this _grave_ bug for stable (etch) and oldstable (sarge)?
It will be very nice if this will be fixed, since the fixed version is in
testing (security) since 2007-11-18.

thanks and best regards

Thomas Sesselmann

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-551-1: OpenLDAP vulnerabilities

4 December 2007

OpenLDAP vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [openldap2.2](/security/cves?package=openldap2.2) -
* [openldap2.3](/security/cves?package=openldap2.3) -

## Details

Thomas Sesselmann discovered that the OpenLDAP slapd server

did not properly handle certain modify requests. A remote

attacker could send malicious modify requests to the server

and cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-5707](/security/CVE-2007-5707))

Toby Blake discovered that slapd did not properly terminate

an array while running as a proxy-caching server. A remote

attacker may be able to send crafted search requests to the

server and cause a denial of service. This issue only affects

Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-5708](/security/CVE-2007-5708))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [slapd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openldap2.3)
  -
  [2.3.35-1ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openldap2.3/2.3.35-1ubuntu0.1)

##### Ubuntu 7.04

* [slapd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openldap2.3)
  -
  [2.3.30-2ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openldap2.3/2.3.30-2ubuntu0.1)

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* [slapd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openldap2.2)
  -
  [2.2.26-5ubuntu3.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openldap2.2/2.2.26-5ubuntu3.2)

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* [slapd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openldap2.2)
  -
  [2.2.26-5ubuntu2.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openldap2.2/2.2.26-5ubuntu2.4)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Bug     : 440632 448644 465875

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenLDAP, a
free implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2007-5707

    Thomas Sesselmann discovered that slapd could be crashed by a
    malformed modify requests.

    Toby Blade discovered that incorrect memory handling in slapo-pcache
    could lead to denial of service through crafted search requests.

CVE-2007-6698

    It was discovered that a programming error in the interface to the
    BDB storage backend could lead to denial of service through
    crafted modify requests.

CVE-2008-0658

    It was discovered that a programming error in the interface to the
    BDB storage backend could lead to denial of service through
    crafted modrdn requests.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.
