Root cause of vulnerability:
Cisco Catalyst 6500 and 7600 series devices use addresses from the 127.0.0.0/8 (loopback) range in the Ethernet Out-of-Band Channel (EOBC) for internal communication. These addresses are unexpectedly accessible from outside the system.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
-  The devices process packets destined for the 127.0.0.0/8 network even when they originate from outside the device, contrary to RFC 3330 which dictates loopback within the host.
-  Access Control Lists (ACLs) not filtering 127.0.0.0/8 address range are bypassed.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can bypass existing access control lists that do not filter the 127.0.0.0/8 address range, gaining access to the Supervisor module, Multilayer Switch Feature Card (MSFC), or any other intelligent module. However, the attacker still requires valid authentication credentials to access the module.

Attack vectors:
An attacker sends packets destined for addresses in the 127.0.0.0/8 range to the vulnerable device from a location outside of the device.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable Cisco device. They would also need to know/guess the snmp community string or userid/password to access the module in question after bypassing access lists.
