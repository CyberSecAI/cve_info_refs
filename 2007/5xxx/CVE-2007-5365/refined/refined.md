**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `cons_options` function within the `options.c` file of the DHCP server (dhcpd). This occurs because the server does not correctly validate the maximum message size option in DHCP requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow.
- Insufficient validation of the maximum message size option in DHCP requests.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of DHCPd based on ISC dhcp-2, including OpenBSD 4.0 through 4.2.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the DHCP server.
- Denial of service (daemon crash) of the DHCP server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a malicious DHCP request from a client to the DHCP server.
- The malicious DHCP request specifies a maximum message size smaller than the minimum IP MTU (576 bytes).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a network client of the vulnerable DHCP server.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send DHCP requests.
