Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2007-5929:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:**  Vulnerable stored procedures in OpenBase SQL Relational Database allow the execution of arbitrary system commands due to insufficient input sanitization. Specifically, the use of backticks within certain stored procedure calls leads to command execution with root privileges.
*   **Buffer Overflow:**  The software is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, potentially leading to heap corruption, due to the lack of proper bounds checking when handling input, such as overly long procedure names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The `AsciiBackup`, `GlobalLog`, and `OEMLicenseInstall` stored procedures are vulnerable. Input passed to these procedures is not properly sanitized allowing execution of system commands through backticks.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** An overly long procedure name can cause memory corruption leading to a crash, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** The command injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary system commands as root. This can lead to full control of the affected system, including data theft, installation of malware, and denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The heap-based buffer overflow allows for the possibility of arbitrary code execution, which also could lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow can cause a crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** Both vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted SQL commands to the vulnerable database server.
*   **Stored Procedure Calls:** The command injection vulnerability is exploited by calling specific vulnerable stored procedures with crafted inputs containing backticks. The buffer overflow is triggered when creating procedures with oversized names.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the OpenBase SQL server.
*   **SQL access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute SQL queries on the database.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable procedures:** The attacker needs to know the names of the vulnerable stored procedures or how to trigger the buffer overflow condition.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory provides specific examples of how to trigger the vulnerabilities using the `AsciiBackup`, `GlobalLog`, and `OEMLicenseInstall` procedures.
*   The advisory mentions that the vendor was notified and released a patch by changing the OpenBase process to run as the 'openbase' user rather than root for security purposes.
*   The buffer overflow vulnerability can be used to run arbitrary shellcode.
