# Firebird: Multiple buffer overflows — GLSA **200712-06**

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows were discovered in Firebird.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/firebird** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.3.12981.0-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.3.12981.0-r2** |

### Background

Firebird is a multi-platfrom, open source relational database.

### Description

Adriano Lima and Ramon de Carvalho Valle reported that functions
isc\_attach\_database() and isc\_create\_database() do not perform proper
boundary checking when processing their input.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially crafted requests to the Firebird
server on TCP port 3050, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firebird
(usually firebird).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Firebird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/firebird-2.0.3.12981.0-r2"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-12 01:40:53 UTC  ``` CVE-2007-5246 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-5246>):   Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in Firebird LI 2.0.0.12748 and   2.0.1.12855, and WI 2.0.0.12748 and 2.0.1.12855, allow remote attackers to   execute arbitrary code via (1) a long attach request on TCP port 3050 to the   isc_attach_database function or (2) a long create request on TCP port 3050 to   the isc_create_database function.  CVE-2007-4992 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-4992>):   Stack-based buffer overflow in the process_packet function in fbserver.exe in   Firebird SQL 2.0.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a   long request to TCP port 3050. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-12 01:45:06 UTC  ``` We handled stabilization of 2.0.3 in [bug 190833](show_bug.cgi?id=190833 "RESOLVED FIXED - dev-db/firebird < 2.0.2 Multiple Vulnerabilities (CVE-2007-{466[456789],5246})") and decided not to issue a GLSA. Two new issues came up that might question this. The first is confirmed for Linux, for the second I don't know.  William, can you advise here? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  William L. Thomson Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-12 13:55:29 UTC  ``` If your asking about doing a GSLA or not. Hard call, but these look a bit more serious than the others. As for the one mentioning fbserver.exe, I would assume that would apply to linux as well. Obviously binary name would be different. But should have same functions, and use. So exploit should be possible regardless of OS for both. IMHO I will see if I can research this a bit to confirm 100%. If not you all can go off this. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-28 11:25:36 UTC  ``` somehow this slipped through our grid. request filed. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-12-09 21:27:26 UTC  ``` GLSA 200712-06 ``` |  |
