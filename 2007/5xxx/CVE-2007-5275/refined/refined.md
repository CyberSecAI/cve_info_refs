    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Adobe Flash:\n\n*   The Stanford University and Ernst and Young's Advanced Security Center reported that Flash does not pin DNS hostnames to a single IP addresses, allowing for DNS rebinding attacks (CVE-2007-5275,CVE-2008-1655).",
    "root_cause": "Flash Player does not pin DNS hostnames to a single IP address, leading to DNS rebinding attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "DNS rebinding",
        "Improper input validation of hostnames"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file (usually in a web browser), possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Adobe Flash Player. The attacker could also cause a user's machine to establish TCP sessions with arbitrary hosts, bypass the Security Sandbox Model, obtain sensitive information, port scan arbitrary hosts, or conduct cross-site-scripting attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted Flash files embedded in web pages.",
        "Web Browser"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious flash file and host it on a webpage or otherwise entice users to open the malicious file"
