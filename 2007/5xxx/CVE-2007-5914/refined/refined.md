      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the JBC Explorer application, specifically how it handles configuration file creation and HTTP headers, allowing for remote code execution.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure configuration file handling",

      "attack_vector": "The attacker sends crafted HTTP POST requests to manipulate the application's files, followed by a crafted HTTP GET request with a custom header to execute arbitrary code.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server running JBC Explorer. Specifically, they need to be able to send POST requests to `dirsys/modules/auth.php` and `dirsys/modules/config/post.php` and GET requests to `dirsys/config.inc.php`"
