Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `show.php` file of Helplink 0.1.0. The script directly includes a file specified by the user via the `file` parameter in the HTTP GET request without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. The application blindly includes a file based on the user-provided input, allowing an attacker to include remote files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a remote file containing malicious PHP code, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a full compromise of the affected system, allowing attackers to steal data, modify the website, or use it as a launching pad for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is executed through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `show.php` script, using the `file` parameter to specify a malicious remote file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs to know about the `show.php` script and its usage of the `file` parameter.
- **Ability to Host Malicious File:** The attacker needs a location to host a malicious PHP file accessible by the vulnerable server.

**Technical Details:**
The relevant code snippet from `show.php` is:
```php
include($HTTP_GET_VARS["file"]);
```
This code takes the value of the `file` parameter from the HTTP GET request and directly includes it as a PHP file without validation, creating the RFI vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Exploit-DB entry provides a concise proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited.
- The vulnerability is specific to Helplink 0.1.0 and its `show.php` file.
- The vulnerability was discovered and published in September 2007.
