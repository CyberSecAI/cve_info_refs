```
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter of the `kategori.asp` page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use SQL injection to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data like usernames and passwords from the `ayar` table, and potentially gain administrative access.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting malicious SQL queries in the `id` parameter of the `kategori.asp` page, specifically by using union select statements.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
