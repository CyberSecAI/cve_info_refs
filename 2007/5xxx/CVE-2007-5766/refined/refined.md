**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability (CWE-89)
- Lack of input sanitization
- Vulnerable `okxLOV.jsp` page in the Administration console

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands in the context of the APPS user.
- This can lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data within the database.
- It can also potentially compromise the entire Oracle E-Business Suite instance.
- Partial impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation via HTTP requests to the vulnerable `okxLOV.jsp` page.
- The attacker crafts malicious SQL code and injects it via the parameters of the HTTP request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No authentication required.
- Remote attacker position on the network with access to the Oracle E-Business Suite instance.
- Basic knowledge of SQL and HTTP protocol.
