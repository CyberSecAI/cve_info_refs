```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application directly includes user-provided input in a PHP include statement without proper sanitization or validation.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include a remote file containing malicious code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Attack vectors: By manipulating the 'view' parameter in the URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and needs to host a malicious php file accessible via http.
