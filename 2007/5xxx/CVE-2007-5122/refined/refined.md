Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2007-5122
*   **Vulnerable Software:** Softbiz Classifieds PLUS
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to an SQL injection vulnerability in the `store_info.php` script. The script takes an `id` parameter and does not sanitize it before using it in an SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database. This could lead to:
    *   Retrieving sensitive information from the database, such as admin credentials (as shown in the example exploit), customer details, or any other stored data.
    *   Modifying data within the database.
    *   Potentially gaining control over the underlying server, depending on the database configuration and privileges.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a web request to the `store_info.php` script with a crafted `id` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit example demonstrates a UNION based SQL injection:

```
http://server.com/store_info.php?id=999999%20union/**/select/**/0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,admin_name,pwd,18,19,20,21,22/**/from/**/sbclassified_admin/*
```
This query attempts to extract the `admin_name` and `pwd` columns from the `sbclassified_admin` table, indicating an attempt to retrieve admin credentials.
