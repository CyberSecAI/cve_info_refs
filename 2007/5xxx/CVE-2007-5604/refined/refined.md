      "source": "www.kb.cert.org_666c3aaf_20250126_004807.html",
      "root_cause": "The HP Online Support Services ActiveX control (HPISDataManager.dll) contains an insecure function, ExtractCab(), that is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system in the context of the local user.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Convincing a user to visit a malicious web page."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious web page that exploits the vulnerable ActiveX control.  Since the ActiveX control is locked to certain domains (like hp.com), the attacker would need to either subvert the host name lookup methodology on the victim's system or exploit a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in one of the allowed domains to deliver the exploit."
