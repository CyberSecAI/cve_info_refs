# 0day PDF pwns Windows

Thu, 20 Sep 2007 13:03:33 GMTby
[pdp](/members/pdp.html)
> I am closing the season with the following **HIGH** Risk vulnerability: Adobe Acrobat/Reader PDF documents can be used to compromise your Windows box. Completely!!! Invisibly and unwillingly!!! All it takes is to open a PDF document or stumble across a page which embeds one.

The issue is quite **critical** given the fact that PDF documents are in the core of today's modern business. This and the fact that it may take a while for Adobe to fix their closed source product, are the reasons why I am not going to publish any POCs. You have to take my word for it. The POCs will be released when an update is available.

> Adobe's representatives can contact me from the usual [place](https://www.gnucitizen.org/contact). My advise for you is not to open any PDF files (locally or remotely). Other PDF viewers might be vulnerable too. The issues was verified on Windows XP SP2 with the latest Adobe Reader 8.1, although previous versions are also affected.

*A formal summary and conclusion of the recent **GNUCITIZEN**'s bug hunt to be expected soon.*

Windows Vista users are not affected.* Here is a harmless demonstration of the issue:

You can also download this video from [here](https://www.gnucitizen.org/static/blog/2007/09/poc.wmv) or [here](https://www.gnucitizen.org/static/blog/2007/09/poc.divx). The PDF issue is officially confirmed by Adobe's team. Foxit is vulnerable as well, although the user is required to interact with the document in order to launch the exploit.![weweje](//gravatar.com/avatar/97025c3b20352e2ea9c7af3be946832b?s=256&d=retro)wewejeThis seems to explain why a wide PDF-attached spam campain had spread around last month. http://sophos.com/pressoffice/news/articles/2007/08/pdf-spam.html![Roach](//gravatar.com/avatar/0008c05234893a8de534f4cecf2f36ce?s=256&d=retro)RoachI, too, would be interested in learning whether certain alternatives are affected as well. In my case, Sumatra, as in the Portable Sumatra version available from portableapps.com![Thor Larholm](//gravatar.com/avatar/4550629aa60f7ef68d07db76ff7244ec?s=256&d=retro)Thor LarholmThis is a little light on the details, but based on the video I would take a wild guess and think that you are using Object Codebase to launch the calculator and notepad. http://www.greymagic.com/security/advisories/gm001-ie/ has a nice example of this that requires no scripting, but does require you to render the HTML inside the My Computer zone. This would fit in well with Adobe Acrobat Reader being able to render HTML snippets and also not having set the FEATURE\_LOCALMACHINE\_LOCKDOWN flag.
A yes or no to the above would be nice, so I don't have to reproduce this myself (lazy me ;)![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpThor, this is not the issue although now when u r mentioning it, it might be a good idea to check it out.![Bruce](//gravatar.com/avatar/1de96b2c4fc711d21836470e268e5c3b?s=256&d=retro)BruceThis is very serious, I wont like a bit that opening my PDF format credit card statement ensures that $1000 is debited by an online transaction. This is scary, shucks!!
thanks pdp![James](//gravatar.com/avatar/e615b9d78a057edb50228c265797baeb?s=256&d=retro)JamesCmon fricken show us some code! or post that pdf file so we can reverse it![Adrian Pastor](//gravatar.com/avatar/ef14ae4ef69235fa6c3709438357819d?s=256&d=retro)Adrian Pastorpdp,
remember to mention that it also works on win2k3 fully patched. I can definitely see some administrators accessing a malicious PDF file from a shared folder which compromises the server when running it on the win2k3 box.![David Kierznowski](//gravatar.com/avatar/1d95d2324345e3dd2e41d6066cc1b492?s=256&d=retro)David Kierznowskipdp, simple and very effective, nice.![Vincent](//gravatar.com/avatar/1051a47d9d7e30b74ed68e9d7bc02d72?s=256&d=retro)VincentVery nice that you found this bug.

Thanks,
Mark![Charles](//gravatar.com/avatar/90991690fca5be1163a586586e355d07?s=256&d=retro)CharlesCould this vulnerability be propagated via a web page? E.g., a coupon page with code hidden it it, that gets the user to print to a pdf file, which when then opened triggers the vulnerability?![packetracer](//gravatar.com/avatar/7d690ffefa92bda80d9990dae56453f0?s=256&d=retro)packetracerTwo questions:
1) When a Adobe confirmed the bug, did they give a timeline for releasing the fix?
2) Can you please not release details until a week (or two) \_after\_ the Adobe update is available? This week or two gives corporate IT guys time to update, and stay ahead of game.
Many thanks!![swhx7](//gravatar.com/avatar/729f89d432ded2a638b6c897f20b2076?s=256&d=retro)swhx7Based on the greymagic link [ http://www.greymagic.com/security/advisories/gm001-ie/ ] it is clear there is an exploit with Activex, though I am not sure it is the only one or the same one that pdp is reporting.
My result with the Greymagic POC on Windows 2000 was that the asp file, downloaded and opened locally, would start calc.exe when opened with IE but not when opened with Seamonkey. This is with Active X totally turned off in 4 IE zones but probably still on in the 5th zone which I have not made visible. (Note, i do not use browser plugins and do not have Adobe installed, so it was clearly the Active X.)
pdp, will you at least say whether what you've found is the same as or different than the greymagic POC? This would help with user protection.![swhx7](//gravatar.com/avatar/729f89d432ded2a638b6c897f20b2076?s=256&d=retro)swhx7Apologies, I see my question was already answered in the reply to Thor. So the new vuln is a different one.![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdppacketracer, adobe confirmed the bug privately. the bug was also confirmed by several friends and well known security researchers who had access to the exploit.
swhx7, the bug is different.![OmegaJunior](//gravatar.com/avatar/83d20f0c77c7c2ede4153838c2d29662?s=256&d=retro)OmegaJuniorThis will still affect user accounts without administration privileges, I assume, but hopefully within the privileges range of the logged-in user? Only administrators will risk having their system taken over?![Suma](//gravatar.com/avatar/d0a588b2287e6c2c4f1610db409e321f?s=256&d=retro)SumaWhy don't you upload the pdf?![herbalist](//gravatar.com/avatar/5298d7022753f583af3c80b4ba44f377?s=256&d=retro)herbalistI understand your reasons for not releasing details or a usable sample of this exploit, though it would sure be nice to have one for testing. In your video, the demo launches calculator. Can this exploit be effectively neutralized with a HIPS and restricting parent-child dependency settings?
Rick![Quadro](//gravatar.com/avatar/e3c10817a8adae852c1fa11a3555553a?s=256&d=retro)QuadroIs the interaction required to launch the exploit in Foxit something that appears normal or not? In other words, is it something that doesn't usually happen? A video of the interaction required would be nice if you can provide it.![Crack](//gravatar.com/avatar/ac5b16e448103d4184fb6b0a30e9c543?s=256&d=retro)CrackHahah what a owner
http://www.marketwatch.com/quotes/adbe![tsw](//gravatar.com/avatar/adb3e4d29fba0d4360f225eba6ba47d7?s=256&d=retro)tswpdp, could you post a regex that can detect PDFs that contain the vulnerability at least? This would allow us to block incoming attachments and uploads without necessarily giving away the exploit itself...![swhx7](//gravatar.com/avatar/729f89d432ded2a638b6c897f20b2076?s=256&d=retro)swhx7The fact that it works in Foxit as well as Adobe reader implies that it relies on a flaw in Windows, not just Adobe's reader.
I'm interpreting "interaction" in Foxit as something more than just opening a PDF. If this is correct, then Foxit can be a safe alternative for now if used with care.
The interaction referred to could be either something with Javascript or clicking a link (any other possibilities? form?). In my version of Foxit, at least up to v.2 I think, Javascript is an optional add-on, not installed by default.![Somewhat_Concerned](//gravatar.com/avatar/253abced36f672589af48bad405580a2?s=256&d=retro)Somewhat\_ConcernedDoes the exploit look for a local file path, a remote file path, or both? At least knowing that much, I can write some IPS rules.![severity](//gravatar.com/avatar/cfdf261e761cbfc46f2484abfc3218fa?s=256&d=retro)severityThe demo video simply executes executables already existing on the local machine with no command line arguments. To me, this is more of a nuisance, than a security issue.
However, if an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with arbitrary command line arguments, then that would be interesting.
Does your exploit allow for arbitrary command line arguments? If so, could you post a PoC loading c:\boot.ini in notepad.exe to prove it?
Or could you explain the security implication of running calc.exe, notepad.exe, or any other common executable in Windows without command line arguments?![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpseverity, arbitrary commands options can be passed but to be honest with you, don't need them. There are ways attackers to execute far more dangerous things then simple commands.![hackathology](//gravatar.com/avatar/271ecedbd232e23677ddc1d3956147eb?s=256&d=retro)hackathologypdp is the facilitator, he starts something cool and create a hype.

The vulnerability that you discovered is vital to one of my demo. Would appreciate it if you know when the patch is out so that I can take a look at the POC.![MustLive](//gravatar.com/avatar/997a9fa55e557e2aa8262a07758b161d?s=256&d=retro)MustLivePdp, nice find! Interesting vulnerability and video.
Waiting for detailed information about it.
You said it works in Acrobat (as shown in video) and in browser. What difference and can you make video (in browser demonstration)? And what browsers are vulnerable (and what Acrobat/Reader/plugin versions except Adobe Reader 8.1).
About video: it is harmless one, but you can make harmful video :-). To show all possibility of this hole and to make people (and Adobe guys) to be more aware of danger of this vulnerability. You can make "format c:" demonstration ;-). Make it in VM environment (it will be harmless and easier for you and will be bright demonstration of the hole).![MadScientist](//gravatar.com/avatar/3c41ba676251eb6ab8d0727fd5313947?s=256&d=retro)MadScientistAny update from Adobe on a patch? I'd at least like to see a public acknowledgment that they are fixing it...![PDP11](//gravatar.com/avatar/e24a97730ac5b4a85e065810664330a3?s=256&d=retro)PDP11Hi guys,
Is The fix out already ?
It's funny, but before I read about this PDF vulnerability, a while back, I was thinking is that possible ? maybe I was just being creatively thinking lol as no one really expect a "text file" be a vehicle for madness !
Note: I've been always PDP11 :) just a coincidence PDP![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpPDP11, not yet... according to my contacts in Adobe, the patch will be available at the end of this month.![codepupil](//gravatar.com/avatar/a140b8dc81fe2816010e7af9696e3ac9?s=256&d=retro)codepupilCan you confirm if this work around will work?

It seems like mailto: handler is by default set to "automatic" launch in Adobe Acrobat/Reader (reg value=2).![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpcodepupil, I need to verify this. There are a few more issues that make the exploit functional and complete.![tigre](//gravatar.com/avatar/a45a726c1555922f3ce86da3d842c701?s=256&d=retro)tigreHi, isn't the point here that only pdf's of unknown origib could be suspicious? Most pdf's are from legitimate providers and so you must mean spam that comes with a pdf. So can normal pdf's even be infected with whatever the exploit is? Or are we talking abour PDF"S FROM SUSPICIOUS SOURCES ONLY HERE OR ALL PDF'S ?![codepupil](//gravatar.com/avatar/a140b8dc81fe2816010e7af9696e3ac9?s=256&d=retro)codepupilPDP, Thanks I've deployed the workaround just in case.
Tigre: It would seem to me the bigger issue is someone embedding this pdf in webpages or in html emails but I may be wrong...![thorin](//gravatar.com/avatar/4d59140c495fbcbc36fdc8bbffd0462b?s=256&d=retro)thorinI have a hard time believing that "XP with IE7" is the only vulnerable combination. Especially when you're example video doesn't seem to depend on IE at all.
Has anyone tested on Win2K? XP w/ IE 6? other![MadScientist](//gravatar.com/avatar/3c41ba676251eb6ab8d0727fd5313947?s=256&d=retro)MadScientistI'm with thorin - a whole shitload of companies who aren't running IE7 have just removed all their mitigations based on that announcement, but I'm not convinced. pdp, can you please confirm that Adobe's workaround really solved the problem that you found? Thanks.![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpMore information on the issue can be found [here](http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2007/10/10/msrc-blog-additional-details-and-background-on-security-advisory-943521.aspx%20) and [here](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/943521.mspx). Adobe has released advisory over [here](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/advisories/apsa07-04.html). Successful exploitation of the PDF issue relays on a few other things.
Microsoft has no other choice but to patch up the issue just to satisfy the community, even though this may not by entirely their problem. First of all developers should not really trust the user input and pass it to a function that they don't fully understand. Now, some of you may criticize me for this statement, but do we blame PHP or ASP for the SQL Injections that your software has? No! Why should anyone pass something that does not look like a URL into a function that expects URLs?![thorin](//gravatar.com/avatar/4d59140c495fbcbc36fdc8bbffd0462b?s=256&d=retro)thorinThanks pdp that technet blog article was great.![Adrian](//gravatar.com/avatar/1265deee50c8070f2203eefe89d67f58?s=256&d=retro)AdrianThanks.
For those who are against the idea of publishing this vulnerability. Their concerns are understood. People just don't like being helpless. To make an analogy, I would imagine that we shouldn't talk about AIDS because we didn't find a cure for it; we shouldn't broadcast news of Burma because we can't help the people there.![MadScientist](//gravatar.com/avatar/3c41ba676251eb6ab8d0727fd5313947?s=256&d=retro)MadScientistAdrian: not the best analogy since AIDS is rampant in the wild and many people are working on stopping it, so we need to talk about it. With the PDF vulnerability, it is still contained.
I'm a big fan of full disclosure \*if the vendor is unresponsive\* as a means to increase pressure for a solution. If I can find a vulnearbility, so can many others, so we need a fix. But if the vendor has acknowledged and is working towards a 'cure', give them time before unleashing the madness.![Picco](//gravatar.com/avatar/ec3f2d09d20ac2e0415d9f37302d195d?s=256&d=retro)PiccoWhy can't we have an example of this vurnerability ?![cyanid-E](//gravatar.com/avatar/c857a3381eab0e4397956df67b5c0d06?s=256&d=retro)cyanid-Ehi

I opened your pdf on a linux system
via:
1. adobe firefox plugin
2. adobe reader 8.1.1 ("Adobe strongly recommends upgrading to Adobe Reader 8.1.1")
and evolution offered me to send an email to guys with really strange email adresses:
1. "windows/system32/calc.exe"
2. test%..
