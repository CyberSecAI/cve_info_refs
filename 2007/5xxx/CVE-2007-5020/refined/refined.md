Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is a vulnerability related to how Adobe Acrobat/Reader processes certain data within PDF documents, particularly how it handles URLs or similar data.
- It appears the software incorrectly interprets or trusts data passed to a function expecting a URL. This allows the execution of local files or commands when processing specially crafted PDF documents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Improper handling of URLs or similar data within PDF documents.
- Lack of sufficient validation of user input passed to URL-handling functions.
- The vulnerability can be exploited even if JavaScript is disabled.
-  The software does not properly sanitize or validate input before passing it to functions that handle URLs, allowing for the execution of local files or commands.
-  The vulnerability was also present in Foxit, though exploitation requires user interaction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Complete compromise of the Windows system.
- Arbitrary code execution.
- Attackers can execute local executables without command line arguments. More complex attacks may also be possible, including arbitrary command execution with arguments.
- The vulnerability allows for the execution of local files/programs when opening a malicious PDF document. This could lead to system compromise or other malicious activity.
- The impact on Foxit is less severe because it requires user interaction to launch the exploit.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Opening a malicious PDF document, either locally or via a web page.
- Embedding the malicious PDF in HTML emails or on web pages.
- The vulnerability exists within the PDF processing mechanism and doesn't rely on browser plugins.
- A malicious PDF file can be delivered through various means, including email attachments, links on websites, or embedded in other documents.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Ability to create or modify PDF files to include malicious data
- No special access privileges on the victim machine are required. The attack can be executed on user accounts without administrator privileges
- The attacker must convince the victim to open the malicious PDF. This can be achieved through social engineering, spam emails, or by embedding the malicious PDF on a website.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability affects Windows XP SP2 with IE7, and Adobe Reader versions 8.1, 8.0, and 7.
- Windows Vista users are not affected.
- The vulnerability was confirmed by Adobe and other security researchers
- The issue is not related to the Object Codebase vulnerability
- Adobe has released a security advisory (APSA07-04) and a patch (APSB07-18).
- Microsoft has released a patch for the underlying issue.
- There was a workaround suggested by Adobe to mitigate this vulnerability.
-  The exploit can be used even when Javascript is disabled.
- The vulnerability can be triggered with an FDF file, which when opened with IE7 and Adobe reader prompts a dialog

The content provides more technical detail than the official CVE description by revealing that the vulnerability involves improper URL handling, arbitrary code execution and affects multiple PDF readers.
