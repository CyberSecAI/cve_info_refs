How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Bacula: Information disclosure — GLSA **200807-10**

A vulnerability in Bacula may allow local attackers to obtain sensitive
information.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-backup/bacula** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.4.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.4.1** |

### Background

Bacula is a network based backup suite.

### Description

Matthijs Kooijman reported that the "make\_catalog\_backup" script uses
the MySQL password as a command line argument when invoking other
programs.

### Impact

A local attacker could list the processes on the local machine when the
script is running to obtain the MySQL password. Note: The password
could also be disclosed via network sniffing attacks when the script
fails, in which case it would be sent via cleartext e-mail.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

A warning about this issue has been added in version 2.4.1, but the
issue is still unfixed. We advise not to use the make\_catalog\_backup
script, but to put all MySQL parameters into a dedicated file readable
only by the user running Bacula.

# CVE-2007-5626

| **Name** | CVE-2007-5626 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | make\_catalog\_backup in Bacula 2.2.5, and probably earlier, sends a MySQL password as a command line argument, and sometimes transmits cleartext e-mail containing this command line, which allows context-dependent attackers to obtain the password by listing the process and its arguments, or by sniffing the network. |
| **Source** | [CVE](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-5626) (at [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-5626); [CERT](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/byid?searchview=&query=CVE-2007-5626), [LWN](https://lwn.net/Search/DoSearch?words=CVE-2007-5626), [oss-sec](https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&s=CVE-2007-5626), [fulldisc](https://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&s=CVE-2007-5626), [Red Hat](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2007-5626), [Ubuntu](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5626), [Gentoo](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2007-5626), SUSE [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2007-5626)/[CVE](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-5626/), GitHub [advisories](https://github.com/advisories?query=CVE-2007-5626)/[code](https://github.com/search?type=Code&q=%22CVE-2007-5626%22)/[issues](https://github.com/search?type=Issues&q=%22CVE-2007-5626%22), [web search](https://duckduckgo.com/html?q=%22CVE-2007-5626%22), [more](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors)) |

## Vulnerable and fixed packages

The table below lists information on source packages.

| Source Package | Release | Version | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [bacula](/tracker/source-package/bacula) ([PTS](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/bacula)) | bullseye | 9.6.7-3 | fixed |
|  | bookworm | 9.6.7-7 | fixed |
|  | sid, trixie | 13.0.4-4 | fixed |

The information below is based on the following data on fixed versions.

| Package | Type | Release | Fixed Version | Urgency | Origin | Debian Bugs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [bacula](/tracker/source-package/bacula) | source | (unstable) | 5.0.0-1 | unimportant |  | [446809](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=446809) |

## Notes

```
this script needs the default database password and name needs to be set which
would be a bigger problem in a non-trusted environment. Apart from
this is documented in the bacula documentation
Since bacula 5.0.0 "make_catalog_backup.pl" is used by default, which is not affected

It's a kernel patch that implements clustering and network load balancing in the kernel.  The patch for 2.4 should apply cleanly to a gentoo-sources kernel (though I haven't tested it myself, if this is not the case I could whip up a patch that will apply cleanly, just append a note to the bug :-).  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Apply patch 2. ??? 3. load balancing! ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Jay Pfeifer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2003-04-27 01:13:57 UTC  ``` i'll look @ it.    Jay  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Jay Pfeifer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2003-05-07 22:31:25 UTC  ``` k, this is in - I've put in pfeifer-sources-2.4.20_pre11  test away.  Thanks,  Jay ``` |  |

Subject: bacula-director-mysql: Database password for catalog backups out in the open
Date: Mon, 15 Oct 2007 22:10:53 +0200
```
[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=446809;msg=5) (text/plain, inline)]

Package: bacula-director-mysql
Severity: important
Tags: patch, security

Hi,

the default bacula configuration file supports backing up the catalog
database using the "make_catalog_backup" script. For this, the following
line is in bacula-dir.conf:
  RunBeforeJob = "/etc/bacula/scripts/make_catalog_backup bacula bacula"
If the database is password protected, the password must be added as a
third argument. This works as expected, but poses up a number of
security risks.

Firstly, when the backup fails, the complete command line is put into an
email with the error messages, including the password. For example:

15-Oct 21:10 stdio.flexvps.nl-dir: BeforeJob: run command
	"/etc/bacula/scripts/make_catalog_backup bacula bacula
 	c1130ee16f7125579d6214bcd114b71"

15-Oct 21:10 stdio.flexvps.nl-dir: BeforeJob: mysqldump: Got error:
	1045: Access denied for user 'bacula'@'localhost' (using password:
	YES) when trying to     +connect

Since email is no secure channel, this can expose the database password.
Having the database password in the error message hardly serves any
purpose and should probably be avoided.

Additionally, having the password on the commandline, makes it available
to users on the same machine. The command lines of running processes are
usually accessible to users, so running a simple

matthijs@stdio:~$ ps aux|grep catalog
bacula   11706  0.0  0.0   4092  1452 ?        S    21:43   0:00 /bin/sh
	/etc/bacula/scripts/make_catalog_backup bacula bacula
	0c1130ee16f7125579d6214bcd114b71

reveals the database password.

It would be better to store the password in an external file, and pass
that filename to the make_catalog_backup script. In this way, the
make_catalog_backup script is still generic, but the database password
is not exposed (though that file should be readable by the bacula user,
not only by root).

The attached patch achieves the above, while maintaining backwards
compatibility. It might be better to remove backwards compatibility to
prevent users from using the old, insecure way, however. Additionally,
my modifications to the script could pose problems if someone uses a
database password that is also the name of an existing file.

Gr.

Matthijs

Summary:                    Database password for catalog backups out in the
open
Description:
This report received at
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=446809>

From: Matthijs Kooijman <matthijs@stdin.nl>

Hi,

the default bacula configuration file supports backing up the catalog
database using the "make_catalog_backup" script. For this, the following
line is in bacula-dir.conf:
  RunBeforeJob = "/etc/bacula/scripts/make_catalog_backup bacula bacula"
If the database is password protected, the password must be added as a
third argument. This works as expected, but poses up a number of
security risks.

Firstly, when the backup fails, the complete command line is put into an
email with the error messages, including the password. For example:

15-Oct 21:10 stdio.flexvps.nl-dir: BeforeJob: run command
	"/etc/bacula/scripts/make_catalog_backup bacula bacula
 	c1130ee16f7125579d6214bcd114b71"

15-Oct 21:10 stdio.flexvps.nl-dir: BeforeJob: mysqldump: Got error:
	1045: Access denied for user 'bacula'@'localhost' (using password:
	YES) when trying to     +connect

Since email is no secure channel, this can expose the database password.
Having the database password in the error message hardly serves any
purpose and should probably be avoided.

Additionally, having the password on the commandline, makes it available
to users on the same machine. The command lines of running processes are
usually accessible to users, so running a simple

matthijs@stdio:~$ ps aux|grep catalog
bacula   11706  0.0  0.0   4092  1452 ?        S    21:43   0:00 /bin/sh
	/etc/bacula/scripts/make_catalog_backup bacula bacula
	0c1130ee16f7125579d6214bcd114b71

reveals the database password.

It would be better to store the password in an external file, and pass
that filename to the make_catalog_backup script. In this way, the
make_catalog_backup script is still generic, but the database password
is not exposed (though that file should be readable by the bacula user,
not only by root).

The attached patch achieves the above, while maintaining backwards
compatibility. It might be better to remove backwards compatibility to
prevent users from using the old, insecure way, however. Additionally,
my modifications to the script could pose problems if someone uses a
database password that is also the name of an existing file.

Yes, I think this is a good idea, but it is a bit too kludgie for me.

Instead, what do you think of the idea of having argument 3 be a path to
where the password is stored, and it would be in a file named
pw-<database-name>.

So the my proposed code would test for the existence of the file using:

 if [ -r "$3/pw-$1" ]; then
    MYSQLPASSWORD=" --password=`cat \"$3/pw-$1\"`"
...

The above would reduce the risk of finding a random file.  Probably a
simpler proposal would be to ignore argument 3 altogether -- i.e.:

 if [ -r "pw-$1" ]; then
    MYSQLPASSWORD=" --password=`cat \"pw-$1\"`"

As you mention, the backward compatibility is not very desireable, but not
having it would create a *lot* of support problems and possibly some
serious errors if the user overlooked fixing it and didn't notice that his
catalog backups were failing.

Hi Kern,

Thanks for your comments on these bugs.  I have forwarded your note to
Matthijs, who submitted this to DEbian.  I'll forward any response back to
you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 COUSINM - 10-19-07 13:23

There is be the possibility of using MYSQL_PWD environment variable, just
the same as the script does for postgresql.
But mysql's documentation says this :
Store your password in the MYSQL_PWD environment variable. This method of
specifying your MySQL password must be considered extremely insecure and
should not be used. Some versions of ps include an option to display the
environment of running processes. If you set MYSQL_PWD, your password is
exposed to any other user who runs ps. Even on systems without such a
version of ps, it is unwise to assume that there are no other methods by
which users can examine process environments. See Section 2.4.20,
“Environment Variables”.

What this paragraph says is applicable for both engines : if the
environment variables can be displayed by ps on some systems, it's
dangerous. Linux doesn't do that as far as I know, but I don't know for
other unixes.

The other possibility I see is using configuration files :
For mysql, in .my.cnf (in user's home directory)
[client]
password=your_pass
(<http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/password-security.html>)

For postgresql, in .pgpass (in user's home directory)
hostname:port:database:username:password
(<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/interactive/libpq-pgpass.html>)

With this solution, you get rid of the configuration parameter, but the
user has some additionnal setup to do.

Perhaps the best course of action is to highlight this as a security issue
in the Bacula documentation.  Leave it to the user to decide what action to
take.

Each environment differs.  If you are running your database server on a
system with non-trusted users, you need to take additional precautions
anyway.

Document it.  Leave it.

I've though about it and decided to go with Dan's suggestion, that is
simply to add more documentation to the file indicating that passing the
password via the command line is insecure.

This is really a database dump implementation problem, or a sys admin
problem not really something that Bacula can solve (at least I don't have a
solution).

In addition, it doesn't seem to me that proposed solution will work, at
least not without additional quoting to delay the application of the ` and
'.  If it does work, it would do so only for MySQL and not for PostgreSQL.
In other words, I find it a kludge and not a complete solution.

A few things about this issue which are worth noting.  In order for someone
to exploit this issue:

- first, the system would require untrusted users on the database server
- the sysadmin would have to use the default password and database name
(bacula, bacula), unlikely on a server with untrusted users
- if the sysadmin did change the default values, they would have to alter
the invocation of the script, would hopefully raise the issue then

Failing all this, we have added warnings to each place the script is used.
 We have also added notes in several places in the documentation.  I also
plan to send out an announcement to our users.

Note that in a default installation, the script is invoked with the
default user name and password (bacula, bacula).

> the default bacula configuration file supports backing up the catalog
> database using the "make_catalog_backup" script. For this, the following
> line is in bacula-dir.conf:
>   RunBeforeJob = "/etc/bacula/scripts/make_catalog_backup bacula bacula"
> If the database is password protected, the password must be added as a
> third argument. This works as expected, but poses up a number of
> security risks.
>
> Firstly, when the backup fails, the complete command line is put into an
> email with the error messages, including the password. For example:

>
>
> Since email is no secure channel, this can expose the database password.

There is no simple solution that works in all cases that I am aware of.  This
potential security problem (no worse than configuring your conf file with
world read permission) has been documented for quite a long time in the
manual.

We've added additional documentation to the scripts in question warning the
user of security problems.

No other changes planned.
