The provided content describes a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability found in ClanLite version 1.23.01.2005.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of `require_once()` and `@include()` functions in `serveur_jeux.php` and `conf-php.php` respectively. These functions include files based on a `$root_path` variable without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The application includes files using a variable `$root_path`, which can be manipulated by an attacker to include remote files via URL.
- Lack of input sanitization: The `$root_path` variable is not checked or sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system.
- Data theft/modification: The attacker could use the RFI vulnerability to steal sensitive data or modify files on the server.
- Website defacement: The attacker could use the RFI vulnerability to deface the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP request: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `$root_path` variable through the HTTP request, typically through a GET/POST parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker must have network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
- Knowledge of the application: The attacker needs to know the vulnerable file paths and how to manipulate the `$root_path` variable.
