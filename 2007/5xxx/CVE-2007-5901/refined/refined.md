  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2007-5901",
    "description": "The `gss_indicate_mechs` function in `g_initialize.c` in the GSSAPI library in MIT Kerberos 5 frees a non-heap pointer. If the allocation of `(*mechSet)->elements` fails the `free(mechSet)` is called which is erroneous because mechSet is a pointer to type `gss_OID_set` passed in by the caller of `gss_indicate_mechs()` and the dereferenced `*mechSet` is where the pointer to allocated memory is assigned. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have other impact.",
    "affected_components": [
      "GSSAPI library in MIT Kerberos 5"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free in the gss_indicate_mechs() function within the GSSAPI library. Specifically, when an allocation fails, the code attempts to free a pointer ('mechSet') that was not allocated by malloc, leading to memory corruption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition, where the application using the GSSAPI library crashes. There's a theoretical possibility of other security impacts, but that would require precise control over memory allocation and subsequent execution flow.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to interact with an application that uses the vulnerable GSSAPI function `gss_indicate_mechs()`. The attacker must be able to trigger a failure of malloc() at the precise time a subsequent allocation is made. It is described as an unlikely set of circumstances to be exploitable."
