How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# MIT Kerberos 5: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200803-31**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in MIT Kerberos 5, which could
allow a remote unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code with root
privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-crypt/mit-krb5** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.6.3-r1** |

### Background

MIT Kerberos 5 is a suite of applications that implement the Kerberos
network protocol. kadmind is the MIT Kerberos 5 administration daemon,
KDC is the Key Distribution Center.

### Description

* Two vulnerabilities were found in the Kerberos 4 support in
  KDC: A global variable is not set for some incoming message types,
  leading to a NULL pointer dereference or a double free()
  (CVE-2008-0062) and unused portions of a buffer are not properly
  cleared when generating an error message, which results in stack
  content being contained in a reply (CVE-2008-0063).
* Jeff
  Altman (Secure Endpoints) discovered a buffer overflow in the RPC
  library server code, used in the kadmin server, caused when too many
  file descriptors are opened (CVE-2008-0947).
* Venustech AD-LAB
  discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the GSSAPI library: usage of a
  freed variable in the gss\_indicate\_mechs() function (CVE-2007-5901) and
  a double free() vulnerability in the gss\_krb5int\_make\_seal\_token\_v3()
  function (CVE-2007-5971).

### Impact

The first two vulnerabilities can be exploited by a remote
unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host running
krb5kdc, compromise the Kerberos key database or cause a Denial of
Service. These bugs can only be triggered when Kerberos 4 support is
enabled.

The RPC related vulnerability can be exploited by a remote
unauthenticated attacker to crash kadmind, and theoretically execute
arbitrary code with root privileges or cause database corruption. This
bug can only be triggered in configurations that allow large numbers of
open file descriptors in a process.

The GSSAPI vulnerabilities could be exploited by a remote attacker to
cause Denial of Service conditions or possibly execute arbitrary code.

### Workaround

Kerberos 4 support can be disabled via disabling the "krb4" USE flag
and recompiling the ebuild, or setting "v4\_mode=none" in the
[kdcdefaults] section of /etc/krb5/kdc.conf. This will only work around
the KDC related vulnerabilities.

### Resolution

All MIT Kerberos 5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.6.3-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

This message responds to multiple alleged vulnerabilities in MIT
Kerberos 5 reported by Venustech AD-LAB.  The alleged vulnerabilities
have CVE identifiers CVE-2007-5894, CVE-2007-5901, CVE-2007-5902,
CVE-2007-5971, and CVE-2007-5972.  For the most part, the bugs are not
exploitable, and the ones which are theoretically exploitable require
extremely unlikely conditions.  We plan to fix these bugs in the next
release, and will open tickets for them in our bug database in the
near future.

CVE-2007-5894
<http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199205>

This is not a vulnerability, and only a stylistic bug.  The alleged
vulnerability consists of reading an uninitialized variable, "length",
in the reply() function in src/appl/gssftp/ftpd/ftpd.c.

  1878                  /* Other auth types go here ... */
  1879                  if (length >= sizeof(in) / 4 * 3) {
  1880                          syslog(LOG_ERR, "input to radix_encode too long");
  1881                          fputs(in, stdout);
  1882                  } else if ((kerror = radix_encode(out, in, &length, 0))) {
  1883                          syslog(LOG_ERR, "Couldn't encode reply (%s)",
  1884                                          radix_error(kerror));
  1885                          fputs(in,stdout);

The "length" variable is only uninitialized if "auth_type" is neither
the "KERBEROS_V4" nor "GSSAPI"; this condition cannot occur in the
unmodified source code.  While the remote user can set the string in
"auth_type", this may only occur by way of the auth_data() function,
which will only set "auth_type" if it exactly matches one of the
aforementioned two strings.

CVE-2007-5901
<http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199214>

This bug is consists of freeing a non-heap pointer, and is not a
practical vulnerability due to the extreme difficulty of exploitation.
In src/lib/gssapi/mechglue/g_initialize.c, the function
gss_indicate_mechs() can make the call free(mechSet), which is
erroneous because "mechSet" is a pointer to type "gss_OID_set" passed
in by the caller of gss_indicate_mechs() and the dereferenced
"*mechSet" is where the pointer to allocated memory is assigned.

   201          /* still need to copy each of the oid elements arrays */
   202          for (i = 0; i < (*mechSet)->count; i++) {
   203                  curItem = &((*mechSet)->elements[i]);
   204                  curItem->elements =
   205                          (void *) malloc(g_mechSet.elements[i].length);
   206                  if (curItem->elements == NULL) {
   207                          (void) k5_mutex_unlock(&g_mechSetLock);
   208                          /*
   209                           * must still free the allocated elements for
   210                           * each allocated gss_OID_desc
   211                           */
   212                          for (j = 0; j < i; j++) {
   213                                  free((*mechSet)->elements[j].elements);
   214                          }
   215                          free((*mechSet)->elements);
   216                          free(mechSet);
   217                          *mechSet = NULL;
   218                          return (GSS_S_FAILURE);
   219                  }
   220                  g_OID_copy(curItem, &g_mechSet.elements[i]);
   221          }

If the allocation of (*mechSet)->elements fails, the erroneous call of
free(mechSet) occurs, freeing a pointer which probably points into the
stack frame of the caller.  In order to successfully exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker would have to cause a malloc() failure to
occur at precisely the right time: almost immediately after a
different malloc() call has succeeded.

CVE-2007-5902
<http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199214>

This bug consists of an integer overflow in
svcauth_gss_get_principal() in src/lib/rpc/svc_auth_gss.c, which can
cause an invocation of memcpy() to overflow a zero-length allocated
buffer.  This is not a practical vulnerability due to the
nigh-impossibility of producing the conditions required to trigger the
bug.

   641  svcauth_gss_get_principal(SVCAUTH *auth)
   642  {
   643          struct svc_rpc_gss_data *gd;
   644          char *pname;
   645
   646          gd = SVCAUTH_PRIVATE(auth);
   647
   648          if (gd->cname.length == 0)
   649                  return (NULL);
   650
   651          if ((pname = malloc(gd->cname.length + 1)) == NULL)
   652                  return (NULL);
   653
   654          memcpy(pname, gd->cname.value, gd->cname.length);
   655          pname[gd->cname.length] = '\0';
   656
   657          return (pname);
   658  }

If "gd->cname.length" is exactly SIZE_MAX, then the call to malloc()
will have an argument of zero due to the modular arithmetic used on
unsigned integer types in C.  If malloc(0) returns a non-null pointer
on a specific platform, then the subsequent memcpy() call can attempt
to copy SIZE_MAX bytes and overflow the zero-length buffer.

The value "gd->cname" results from calling krb5_unparse_name() with a
principal obtained during authentication.  To successfully exploit
this vulnerability, an attacker would need to successfully
authenticate using a principal name whose unparsed string
representation is exactly SIZE_MAX+1 bytes long.  Such a principal
name is very unlikely to exist, and even if such an unusual principal
did exist, the C implementation would have to successfully allocate a
buffer SIZE_MAX+1 bytes long, which almost certainly will not succeed.

CVE-2007-5971
<http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199212>

This bug is a double-free condition which is not a practical
vulnerability due to the extreme difficulty of exploitation.  If
krb5_c_make_checksum() (in src/lib/gssapi/krb5/k5sealv3.c) fails,
"outbuf" may be freed twice.

   244          err = krb5_c_make_checksum(context, ctx->cksumtype, key,
   245                                     key_usage, &plain, &sum);
   246          zap(plain.data, plain.length);
   247          free(plain.data);
   248          plain.data = 0;
   249          if (err) {
   250              zap(outbuf,bufsize);
   251              free(outbuf);
   252              goto error;
   253          }
...
   290  error:
   291      free(outbuf);
   292      token->value = NULL;
   293      token->length = 0;
   294      return err;
   295  }

krb5_c_make_checksum() only fails if malloc() fails to allocate a very
small amount of memory.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker
would need to force a malloc() failure at exactly the point where
krb5_c_make_checksum is called.

CVE-2007-5972
<http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199211>

This bug is a double-free (actually a double-fclose) bug which is not
a vulnerability due to inaccessibility to an attacker.  If the
fwrite() call in krb5_def_store_mkey() (in src/lib/kdb/kdb_default.c)
fails, the file pointer "kf" may have fclose() called on it twice.

   180      if ((fwrite((krb5_pointer) &enctype,
   181                  2, 1, kf) != 1) ||
   182          (fwrite((krb5_pointer) &key->length,
   183                  sizeof(key->length), 1, kf) != 1) ||
   184          (fwrite((krb5_pointer) key->contents,
   185                  sizeof(key->contents[0]), (unsigned) key->length,
   186                  kf) != key->length)) {
   187          retval = errno;
   188          (void) fclose(kf);
   189      }
   190      if (fclose(kf) == EOF)
   191          retval = errno;

The relevant code stashes a KDC master key.  It is only run by
explicit action of a KDC administrator, who already has all the
privileges that exploiting this bug would gain.  A properly configured
KDC will have no unprivileged users having shell or other login
access; therefore, an unprivileged user cannot cause the fwrite()
failure necessary for triggering this bug.  Also, under normal
conditions, the code is run exactly once in the lifetime of a KDC: at
database creation time.

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-924-1: Kerberos vulnerabilities

7 April 2010

Kerberos vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [krb5](/security/cves?package=krb5) -

## Details

Sol Jerome discovered that the Kerberos kadmind service did not correctly

free memory. An unauthenticated remote attacker could send specially

crafted traffic to crash the kadmind process, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2010-0629](/security/CVE-2010-0629))

It was discovered that Kerberos did not correctly free memory in

the GSSAPI library. If a remote attacker were able to manipulate an

application using GSSAPI carefully, the service could crash, leading to

a denial of service. (Ubuntu 8.10 was not affected.) ([CVE-2007-5901](/security/CVE-2007-5901),

[CVE-2007-5971](/security/CVE-2007-5971))

It was discovered that Kerberos did not correctly free memory in the

GSSAPI and kdb libraries. If a remote attacker were able to manipulate

an application using these libraries carefully, the service could crash,

leading to a denial of service. (Only Ubuntu 8.04 LTS was affected.)

([CVE-2007-5902](/security/CVE-2007-5902), [CVE-2007-5972](/security/CVE-2007-5972))

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
