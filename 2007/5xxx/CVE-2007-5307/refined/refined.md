The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the "Else If CMS" including Remote File Inclusion (RFI), Remote File Upload, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Specifically, CVE-2007-5307 is referenced in relation to these vulnerabilities, but the provided content doesn't describe which specific vulnerability it refers to and the details are more of a general advisory of different flaws. 

Here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The CMS improperly handles user-supplied input in several files (`contenus.php`, `votes.php`, `espaceperso.php`, `enregistrement.php`, `commentaire.php`, `coeurusr.php`, `fonctions.php`, `usrarticles.php`, `usrdepot.php`), allowing an attacker to include remote files by injecting URLs into the `contenus` or `tpelseifportalrepertoire` parameters or the `corpsdesign` parameters
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the URL parameters to include malicious files from an external server.
    *  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution by including a malicious file.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

*   **Remote File Upload:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `upload.php` script in the `swfupload` directory allows arbitrary file uploads without proper validation or authorization.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted POST request to the `upload.php` script, with a malicious PHP file disguised as a legitimate file.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution by uploading and executing a malicious script.
     *   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to make HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of user input in multiple files (`vousetesbannis.php`, `votesresultats.php`, `adminforum.php`), allowing injection of JavaScript code.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending malicious JavaScript code via URL parameters (`repertimage`, `elseifvotetxtresultatduvote`, or `elseifforumtxtmenugeneraledufo`).
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement or redirecting to malicious websites.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to make victims access malicious URLs.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided exploit code targets the Remote File Upload vulnerability, specifically the `elseif/externe/swfupload/upload.php` endpoint.
*   The exploit script sends a crafted POST request with a PHP shell in order to achieve command execution.
*   The script checks if the shell was uploaded successfully by verifying if the server is able to execute the command using the shell, by requesting the shell.

**In summary,** the content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Else If CMS including Remote File Inclusion, Remote File Upload and XSS. The provided exploit focuses on the Remote File Upload vulnerability.

Given that the CVE description is a placeholder and the content provides further information regarding the exploitation details, the answer is:

```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist including improper handling of user input in URL parameters leading to Remote File Inclusion and XSS, and an unprotected file upload script allowing arbitrary file uploads.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI), Remote File Upload, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution through remote file inclusion and/or file upload, and potential session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting to malicious websites through XSS.",
  "Attack vectors": "Maliciously crafted URLs to include external files (RFI), sending crafted POST requests to upload malicious PHP scripts (Remote File Upload), and injecting JavaScript through URL parameters (XSS).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server (RFI, File Upload) and ability to make victims access a malicious URL (XSS)."
