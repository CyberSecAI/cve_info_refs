Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5309:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) issue. It occurs because the `include()` function in the `admin.wmtgallery.php` file of the Joomla Flash Image Gallery component uses the `$mosConfig_live_site` variable without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly includes a file based on a user-controlled variable, allowing an attacker to specify a malicious remote file to be included and executed by the server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `$mosConfig_live_site` parameter isn't validated or sanitized before being used in the `include()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control of the affected system and the web application.
- **Data Compromise:** The attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored on the server.
- **Website Defacement or Manipulation:** The attacker could modify website content or disrupt its normal operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `admin.wmtgallery.php` file, specifying a URL for the `$mosConfig_live_site` parameter that points to a malicious remote file.
  Example from exploit-db: `/administrator/components/com_wmtgallery/admin.wmtgallery.php?mosConfig_live_site=shell?`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target web server.
- **Understanding of Target Application:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable component and its parameters to craft the malicious URL.
