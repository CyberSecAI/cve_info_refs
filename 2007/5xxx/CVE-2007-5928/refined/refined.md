Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Command Injection:**  Vulnerability exists in the way OpenBase SQL handles input within certain stored procedures. Specifically, the use of backticks within parameters of stored procedures allows execution of arbitrary system commands.
*   **Buffer Overflow:**  The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when processing input, specifically overly long stored procedure names and potentially other parameters. This leads to memory corruption, heap corruption, and potential crashes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:**  Unsanitized user-controlled input to stored procedures allows the injection of system commands, leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Heap Corruption:** Lack of proper bounds checking when handling large inputs leads to memory corruption within the heap.
*   **Buffer Overflow:**  A classic buffer overflow vulnerability that can be used to overwrite parts of memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** Attackers can gain root/SYSTEM-level privileges on the affected system by exploiting the command injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, giving attackers full control over the system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Memory corruption can lead to crashes, causing a denial of service.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The ability to execute arbitrary commands could be leveraged to manipulate and exfiltrate data.
*   **Backdoor Creation:** The ability to create root owned files can be used to create backdoors to the system for persistence.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Database Interaction:** Attackers would need the ability to connect to the OpenBase SQL database.
*   **Stored Procedure Calls:**  Exploitation involves calling specific vulnerable stored procedures with malicious input.
*   **Long Procedure Names:** Creating procedures with overly long names triggers the buffer overflow.
*   **Arbitrary Data Injection:**  The vulnerabilities are triggered through the injection of arbitrary data into stored procedure parameters, either through stored procedures using backticks, or with overly long strings to cause a buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Database Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OpenBase SQL server and sufficient credentials to interact with the database.
*   **Stored Procedure Knowledge:** Knowledge of the vulnerable stored procedures is required to perform command injection and trigger buffer overflows.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that several default stored procedures are vulnerable to command injection, specifically calling out AsciiBackup, GlobalLog and OEMLicenseInstall.
*   The vendor has addressed the vulnerabilities by changing the user under which the OpenBase application runs.
*   The advisory includes proof of concept examples showing the usage of the vulnerabilities including `call AsciiBackup('\`id\`')`, `call GlobalLog("../../../path/to/file", "\n user input goes here \n")`, and `call OEMLicenseInstall("`/usr/bin/id>/tmp/aaax`","`/usr/bin/id>/tmp/bbbx`","`/usr/bin/id>/tmp/ddddx`","`/usr/bin/id>/tmp/cdfx`")` to demonstrate command execution.
*   The buffer overflow example is demonstrated using `select aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa... from aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...`.
