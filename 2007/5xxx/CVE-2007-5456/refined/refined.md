{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Internet Explorer 7 and earlier versions do not properly handle filenames when downloading files, specifically when a question mark ('?') followed by a non-.exe filename is appended to an .exe filename.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Bypass of file download security warnings.",
      "Improper input validation of file extensions when initiating downloads."
    ],
    "impact": "Allows a remote attacker to bypass the 'File Download - Security Warning' dialog box and download arbitrary .exe files directly to the user's computer, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's system. The downloaded .exe may be executed by Windows media player or other application based on the extension used after the question mark.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote: by crafting a URL with the vulnerable filename format.",
       "By tricking a user into clicking a malicious link."
    ],
   "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious .exe file and be able to present a malicious URL to the victim user. No authentication is required.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability specifically affects .exe files and does not work with other executable types such as .COM or .PIF. By appending certain file extensions after the question mark, the browser bypasses the security warning and initiates the download. Specific vulnerable extensions include .txt, .cda, .log, .dif, .sol, .htt, .itpc, .itms, .dvr-ms, .dib, .asf, .tif, and other unspecified extensions. The issue might not cross privilege boundaries, but it still bypasses an intended protection mechanism."
