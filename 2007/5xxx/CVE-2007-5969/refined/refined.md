{
  "CVE-2007-5969": {
    "Root cause": "Insecure handling of symbolic links during the creation of tables with DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY statements.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Symbolic links are not properly validated or handled when creating database tables with specific directory options."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service by overwriting data. Could potentially lead to privilege escalation by overwriting MySQL system tables.",
    "Attack vectors": "An authenticated database user can create a table with DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY, pointing to a location where they can create a symbolic link. After creating the symbolic link, they can rename the table, causing the symbolic link to be followed and overwriting a target file or directory.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Authenticated database user with the ability to create tables with DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY options."
  }
}
