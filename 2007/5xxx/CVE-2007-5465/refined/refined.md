  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_ee4a973a_20250125_201723.html",
      "root_cause": "The application directly includes files based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information such as passwords, configuration files, and source code. The attacker could also potentially gain remote code execution by including files containing malicious code if the server allows it.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request with a crafted 'page' parameter containing directory traversal sequences and a null byte terminator."
      ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and requires that `magic_quotes_gpc` are set to off. They need to be able to craft the URL to include the directory traversal sequence and null byte."
    }
