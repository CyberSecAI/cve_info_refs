Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper handling of URLs by the BT Home Hub's web interface. Specifically, the device accepts multiple representations of the same URL as valid but only checks for authentication credentials when the URL is in its original, expected form. This allows attackers to bypass authentication by using modified or "fuzzed" URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the router's password authentication system. Attackers can make administrative requests to the router without needing a username and password.
*   **URL Fuzzing:** The web server or server-side scripts incorrectly process URLs, allowing variations of a URL to bypass authentication checks. This is caused by not normalizing URLs before checking permissions.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The content mentions several persistent and non-persistent XSS vulnerabilities, which attackers could leverage to further exploit the router.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The router is also susceptible to CSRF attacks. This could be used to make unauthorized administrative changes.
*   **Unprotected HTTP Methods/Requests:** The device does not properly check HTTP methods or protect certain CGI scripts, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Administrative Control:** Attackers can gain full administrative control of the router.
*   **Eavesdropping on VoIP:** Attackers can listen in on VoIP calls.
*   **VoIP Credential Theft:** Attackers can steal VoIP credentials.
*   **WPA/WEP Key Theft:** The exploit allows for stealing the WPA/WEP key, potentially exposing the entire network.
*   **DNS Manipulation:** Attackers can change DNS settings, redirecting users to fraudulent websites.
*   **Backdoor Installation:** Attackers can enable a backdoor for persistent remote access.
*  **Disable Wireless:** Attackers can disable the wireless network.
*   **Configuration File Access/Modification**: Attackers can steal or modify the router's configuration file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** The primary attack vector is a maliciously crafted website. Users are lured into visiting this site, and the exploit is triggered silently in the background.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attack relies on social engineering techniques to trick users into visiting the malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** Attackers can be located remotely and do not need physical access to the router.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** Attackers need a basic understanding of web vulnerabilities and how to craft malicious web pages.
*   **No Credentials Required:** The attacker does not need to know the router's administrator password.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in BT Home Hub routers, which are Thomson/Alcatel Speedtouch 7G routers.
*   The vulnerability is present in the most recent firmware of the BT Home Hub, and likely other Speedtouch 7G models.
*   The vulnerability was demonstrated using a malicious website that uses a POST request with a "fuzzed" URL to bypass authentication.

This vulnerability was actively being investigated by BT, and they were pushing out new firmware updates at the time of the article.
