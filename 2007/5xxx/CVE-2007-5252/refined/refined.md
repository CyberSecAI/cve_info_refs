  {
    "ID": "CVE-2007-5252",
    "content": "The NetSupport Manager client that listens on TCP port 5405 does not properly validate input supplied during the initial connection sequence.\nSpecifically, during the configuration exchange part of the initial connection setup, the client does not appear to validate the supplied data which can result in a DoS of the NetSupport Manager Client. Remote code exploitation is also thought to be possible.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation during the initial connection sequence of the NetSupport Manager client.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow due to lack of input validation."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) of the NetSupport Manager client. Potential for remote code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network connection to the vulnerable client on TCP port 5405."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection with the vulnerable NetSupport Manager client listening on port 5405. No authentication is required for exploitation. Attack complexity is low."
