## Nutshell

What you see here is the output of the "arfis project", a simple perl script. It automatically downloads and extract PHP projects from [sourceforge.net](http://sourceforge.net) and checks for [Remote File Inclusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_File_Inclusion) vulnerabilities. It then post's the potential (now it's -potential-, cause the script is in an early stadium) vuln to this blog.

## todo

- get scripts from hotscripts.com

- check for .htaccess files wich could prevent RFI's

- check if the "variable" is DOCUMENT\_ROOT or such

- other improvements

## note

The found RFI's are not re-checked, nor if they work, nor if they were already found. Arfis is not a 100% valuable source, so don't blame it if you get a non working or existing RFI. Thanks.
