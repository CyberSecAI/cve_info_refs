The research is made of two components: a purple paper and a video. The research doesn't just cover boring PoCs, but actual Hollywood-style exploits :-) . Yes, this includes the classic attack in which the legitimate video stream gets replaced by another stream that keeps looping forever!
In the paper we only cover new vulnerabilities affecting older \_and\_ the latest firmware. The most eye-catching ones are perhaps the following issues affecting the latest version of the firmware (2.43):
System-wide Cross-site Request Forgeries (CSRF) ? any admin action can be forged by design!
Non-persistent Cross-site Scripting (XSS) on 404 error pages
Persistent cross-site Scripting (XSS) on the network settings page
Persistent cross-site Scripting (XSS) on the video viewing page
Persistent cross-site Scripting (XSS) on the logs viewing facility
