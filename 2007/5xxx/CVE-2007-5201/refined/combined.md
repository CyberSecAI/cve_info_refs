| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c0)  Lubomir Kundrak    2007-09-17 11:57:57 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  When duplicity's FTP backend calls ncftp, it passws the password argument via command line. That's bad -- anyone can see that. On the other side, it's a very good practice to overwrite the password string in the address space wfter it's used, though it can still be viewed under a time-dependent race condition, that's why I am cloning this to ncftp also.  Additional info:  See URL for the Deban BTS entry [1] for more details. [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=442840>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c1)  Lubomir Kundrak    2007-09-17 12:07:22 UTC  ``` [Bug #293091](show_bug.cgi?id=293091 "CLOSED NOTABUG - Please erase the password in address space as soon as it is used") is the ncftp one.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c2)  Lubomir Kundrak    2007-09-17 12:11:48 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier for this was requested.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c3)  Robert Scheck    2007-09-17 12:13:59 UTC  ``` Thanks for you report, Lubomir. Do you know, whether upstream was already  notified about this security issue? I would like to avoid, that upstream and/or  multiple downstreams are doing the same work in parallel.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c4)  Lubomir Kundrak    2007-09-17 15:17:03 UTC  ``` Robert -- I have no idea whether upstream knows about the issue. I usually put all information I know into the bug report. Please look at the debian bug to see whether they did report and check the public mailing lists of the project (I presume this would be reported via a public mailing list, as it's a public issue).  Also, please don't change the Version of the Product this report is assigned to. I care about having this fixed in f7 and this report is also for my track. It is usually natural that all fixes for problems from stable branches propagate to devel, if devel is affected.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c5)  Robert Scheck    2007-09-17 15:33:50 UTC  ``` I don't care about the version number, the issue has to be resolved in any case for EL4, EL5, FC6 (when a fix comes up before EOL), F7 and F8/devel. I will contact upstream directly to see, whether they know anything about it this time.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c6)  Robert Scheck    2007-09-17 16:11:43 UTC  ``` Here is the reply from the upstream guy:  Yes, I am aware of the problem.  One of the RCs used that solution. [comment:  the FIFO I mentioned in my e-mail]  The problem is that the ncftp program has different command line and control file semantics for at least three of the most recent versions of the program.  Since we cannot lock the user into only one version of an external program, I chose the path of least resistance.  Its an easy patch to make it work with a single version, but it would break when ncftp is upgraded.  That's not a situation we want to get into for any distro.  ...Ken  Disclaimer:  If you are on a system that is that insecure to begin with, you need to rethink protocol.  Not only is it available on the command line, but on the net.  Anyone with a sniffer could get it just as easy, from inside and outside your net.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c7)  Lubomir Kundrak    2007-09-17 17:21:27 UTC  ``` I'd say it's no problem to lock to a particular ncftp version we ship in Fedora, and note a Require: on that version. It might be nice to put a comment above Version: to both packages so that a developer that eventually bumps revision ensures that he didn't break compatibility.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c8)  Robert Scheck    2007-09-17 18:02:28 UTC  ``` I also don't see a problem to lock duplicity to a specific ncftp version,  finally one more reply from upstream below:  I don't have a patch available.  That feature was in a version a few iterations ago and used mkstemp() to securely make a temp file.  I'll look into the FIFO option and get back to you.  It would be a good thing to have a patch available for others to use if they wanted.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c9)  Robert Scheck    2007-09-19 09:03:41 UTC  ``` Reply from upstream but only a possible solution for ncftp 3.2.1 which is not  in all branches available IIRC:  Here's the fix for users of ncftp 3.2.1.  The previous versions of ncftp have bugs relating to the use of -f, or require non-orthogonal command options for the various utilities.  <https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6209>  ...Ken   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c10)  Robert Scheck    2007-09-19 12:11:47 UTC  ``` More from upstream:  Guys,  There have been a couple of upstream fixes that may be of interest:  [Bug 21123](show_bug.cgi?id=21123 "CLOSED WONTFIX - console banner should report memory size") - duplicity does not find any backup chains - Important <https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?21123>  Patch 6211 - restore strict host checking in sshBackend - Security <https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/index.php?6211>  ...Ken   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c11)  Lubomir Kundrak    2007-10-02 13:07:54 UTC  ``` As you might get noticed, ncftp thingie was closed, and future versions of ncftp will be overwriting the password in argv[] as it is used. Still a race though.  Robert: When would it be possible to roll an updated package?   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c12)  Robert Scheck    2007-10-02 17:13:50 UTC  ``` Ehm Lubomir, the ncftp bug report was marked as NOTABUG. Finally I can't see  any fix which would work for all Fedora and EPEL branches...maybe you've to  remove the tomatoes from my eyes, please?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2007-10-05 06:43:56 UTC  ``` CVE id [CVE-2007-5201](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-5201) was assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c14)  Robert Scheck    2007-10-16 07:52:07 UTC  ``` Lubomir? Ping? Can you please reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c11)? No reply, no update ;-)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c15)  Lubomir Kundrak    2007-11-01 22:28:22 UTC  ``` Robert; Well, leave this open. Maybe once I'll find time to look at this. Mabye you --- all in all, you're the maintainer and one that is responsible to keep his package secure :)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c17)  Robert Scheck    2007-11-01 22:45:26 UTC  ``` Please let me know, when a fix is available. Upstream doesn't see this as real  issue and <http://www.nongnu.org/duplicity/CHANGELOG> doesn't point out changes  regarding this.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c18)  Fedora Update System    2008-02-10 17:17:40 UTC  ``` duplicity-0.4.9-1.fc7 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 7   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c19)  Fedora Update System    2008-02-10 17:17:43 UTC  ``` duplicity-0.4.9-1.fc8 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 8   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c20)  Fedora Update System    2008-02-13 04:59:50 UTC  ``` duplicity-0.4.9-1.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=293081#c21)  Fedora Update System    2008-02-13 05:12:23 UTC  ``` duplicity-0.4.9-1.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

Package: duplicity
Version: 0.4.3-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Password details are passed to ncftp on the command line rather than via
a file descriptor, environment variable or some other method that would
keep the data private.

$ pgrep -fl ncftp
1153 sh -c ncftpput -F -t 30 -u 'ftpuser' -p 'ftppass' -V -c 'ftp.example.com' '2007-38/root/duplicity-full.2007-09-17T10:30:20+01:00.vol70.difftar.gpg' < '/tmp/duplicity.mTFZZY'
1154 ncftpput -F -t 30 -u ?         -p ?        -V -c ftp.example.com 2007-38/root/duplicity-full.2007-09-17T10:30:20+01:00.vol70.difftar.gpg

The same applies for the way ncftpls is invoked, and presumably also for
any other ncftp commands that are used.

According to the ncftpput man page:

	Using  the  -u and -p options are not recommended, because your account
	information is exposed to anyone who can see your shell script or  your
	process  information.   For example, someone using the ps program could
	see your password while the program runs.

	You may use the -f option instead to specify a file  with  the  account
	information.   However, this is still not secure because anyone who has
	read access to the information file can see  the  account  information.
	Nevertheless,  if  you choose to use the -f option the file should look
	something like this:

		   host sphygmomanometer.ncftp.com
		   user gleason
		   pass mypassword

	Don’t forget to change the permissions on this file so no one else  can
	read them.

So the correct way to use this option would be to call os.umask (077), then
create the file. It might even be better to create a FIFO and pass the details
in that way.

thanks for spotting these two ftp-related bugs; a fix is forthcoming
and a new version will be uploaded tonight.

Description:
 duplicity  - encrypted bandwidth-efficient backup
Closes: [442834](bugreport.cgi?bug=442834) [442840](bugreport.cgi?bug=442840)
Changes:
 duplicity (0.4.3-2) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * now suggests ncftp (closes: #[442834](bugreport.cgi?bug=442834)) and mentions that in NEWS.Debian
     i have decided that Recommends: is too strong here, as ftp is a lousy
     protocol which should be avoided as much as possible.
   * applied upstream fix for leaking ftp passphrases via the commandline
     (closes: #[442840](bugreport.cgi?bug=442840)). the fix works only with ncftp version 3.2.1
     and newer, which means etch is out.
   * applied upstream patch for upstream-#21123, which fixes another
     ftp backend problem.
   * finally fixed the superfluous passphrase dialogs
   * tidied build process for easier integration into ubuntu, removing
     some unnecessary python version dependencies
   * applied upstream patch for upstream-#6211, restoring strict host key
     checks for the ssh backend.
