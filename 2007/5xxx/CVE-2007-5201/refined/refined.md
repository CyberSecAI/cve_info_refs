Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-5201:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `duplicity` backup utility, when using the FTP backend, passes the FTP password as a command-line argument to the `ncftp` program.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The password is included in the command line, making it visible to other users who can view process information via tools like `ps`. This violates the principle of keeping passwords private.
*   **Insecure Command-Line Handling:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of secure handling of sensitive data (the password). The password should not be exposed as a plain-text argument in a command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who can observe the command line or process list while `duplicity` is running can steal the FTP password, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the FTP server and its contents.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker could gain access to backed-up data or other sensitive information stored on the FTP server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local System Access:** An attacker with local access to the machine where `duplicity` is running can view the command line arguments.
*   **Process Inspection:** An attacker could observe process information using tools like `ps`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have some level of access to the system running the `duplicity` command.
*   **Process Monitoring Tools:** The attacker must be able to use tools to view running processes, like `ps`.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The `ncftp` program has command line and control file options for credentials, but the `duplicity` was not making use of those. The recommended way to pass credentials was using a file with specific permissions.
*   The upstream maintainer of duplicity was aware of the issue but stated they had chosen the path of least resistance because of versioning issues with ncftp.
*   The issue is partially mitigated by the fact that `ncftp` might overwrite the password in argv[], but still remains vulnerable to time-dependent race conditions.
*   A fix was released for `duplicity` which uses a more secure method for passing FTP credentials to `ncftp`
*   The fix for the issue works with ncftp versions 3.2.1 and newer.
