{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Feedreader application uses the Internet Explorer browser control to render HTML content from RSS feeds. When a user clicks on an RSS item, the application displays a locally cached HTML file. This allows any script embedded within the HTML or referenced externally to execute in the Local Zone.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-zone scripting vulnerability, due to the insecure rendering of HTML content from RSS feeds.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can create or manipulate an RSS feed to include malicious scripts, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious RSS feed that contains embedded or referenced malicious scripts. The user must subscribe to this feed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create or manipulate an RSS feed. The user must be convinced to subscribe to the malicious feed."
