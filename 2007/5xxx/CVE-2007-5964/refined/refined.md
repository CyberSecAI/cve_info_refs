      "source": "bugzilla.redhat.com_bacdb8ce_20250125_000702.html",
      "root_cause": "The autofs configuration for /net did not include the 'nosuid' mount option.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The absence of the 'nosuid' mount option on the /net autofs mount allows for the execution of setuid binaries from remotely mounted file systems, potentially leading to privilege escalation."
