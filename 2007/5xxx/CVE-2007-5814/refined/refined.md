  "CVE-2007-5814": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the SonicWALL SSL-VPN client's ActiveX controls.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Deletion of arbitrary files via the WebCacheCleaner ActiveX control.",
         "Stack-based buffer overflow in the AddRouteEntry() method of the NELaunchCtrl ActiveX control when copying the second parameter without length validation.",
        "Unicode overflows in multiple properties of NELaunchCtrl ActiveX Control, including 'serverAddress', 'sessionId', 'clientIPLower', 'clientIPHigher', 'userName', 'domainName', and 'dnsSuffix'."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could take control of affected clients by placing exploit code on a webserver and enticing VPN users to visit the malicious website, leading to arbitrary file deletion and remote code execution. Attackers could also leverage other attack vectors such as DNS redirection or exploiting intranet websites.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Placing exploit code on a webserver and enticing users to visit it (e.g., via phishing attacks).",
         "DNS redirection.",
        "Exploiting intranet websites."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to host a malicious web page and entice the SonicWALL SSL-VPN client user to visit it. No specific user position is mentioned, but social engineering may be required."
    },
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerabilities were discovered by an independent security researcher and purchased by SEC Consult. Proof of concept code for file deletion is provided, along with details on triggering the stack overflow. The vendor was notified, and a patch was released in September 2007 with version 2.1 of SSL-VPN 200 and version 2.5 of SSL-VPN 2000/4000. A code execution exploit is not publicly released due to its trivial nature, but users are strongly advised to apply the update. This content provides more detail than the official CVE description, outlining specific vulnerable components and methods."
