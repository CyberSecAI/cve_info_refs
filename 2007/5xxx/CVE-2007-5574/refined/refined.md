Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw in the `djpage.php` script of PHPDJ version 0.5. The script includes the value of the `page` parameter without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to include remote files.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI). This is a classic web application vulnerability where user-supplied input is used to include or execute code from a remote location.

*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this RFI vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete compromise of the affected web server and potentially the underlying system, depending on server permissions and the content of the included malicious file.

*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a web request to `djpage.php` with a crafted `page` parameter pointing to a malicious remote file.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    *   The attacker needs to host or have access to a malicious script on a server accessible by the vulnerable server.
    *   The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
    *   The vulnerable application must be accessible via the network.
