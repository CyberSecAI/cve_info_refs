Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in SimpGB version 1.46.02:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities stem from flaws in the product scripts of SimpGB, which allow attackers to access sensitive information by directly requesting files that should not be publicly accessible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **File Content Disclosure:** The first vulnerability allows attackers to directly access and screen the content of arbitrary files, including .inc files, revealing potentially sensitive information (like database table definitions).
2.  **Information Disclosure:** The second vulnerability allows attackers to access sensitive information such as database connection details, program settings, program paths, session information, cookies, and SMTP configurations. This is done by directly accessing the `cfginfo.php` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **File Content Disclosure:**  Attackers can obtain sensitive information contained within exposed files, which could aid in further attacks or compromise of the system.
2.  **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data like database credentials, which can lead to complete compromise of the database and the application. Access to session and cookie data can enable session hijacking and account takeovers.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by directly accessing the vulnerable files via HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable server and knowledge of the vulnerable file paths. No authentication is required, making the vulnerabilities easily exploitable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor, Bosch IT-Consulting, confirmed the issues and released version 1.47 to address them.
*   The provided examples show how to access `dbtables.inc` and `cfginfo.php` to demonstrate the vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by Jesper Jurcenoks of netVigilance.
*   The severity of the vulnerabilities is rated as 'Partial Confidentiality Impact, No Integrity Impact, No Availability Impact' for the first vulnerability, and 'Partial Confidentiality Impact, No Integrity Impact, Partial Availability Impact' for the second vulnerability based on CVSS v2.
*   Workarounds include changing file permissions, modifying `.htaccess` files, or deleting the `cfginfo.php` file.
*   The vulnerabilities were disclosed on September 25, 2007.
