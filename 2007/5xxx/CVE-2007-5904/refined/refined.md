{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple buffer overflows in the CIFS VFS (Virtual File System) component of the Linux kernel.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflows in the `SendReceive` function of the CIFS VFS module."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service (crash) and potentially execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending long SMB (Server Message Block) responses that trigger overflows in the `SendReceive` function.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to misrepresent or replace a CIFS server that the client machine is connected to. They also need to be able to send specially crafted, oversized SMB responses to the client."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The exploitability of this problem is not known, according to the SUSE security advisory, and the vulnerability requires that the client machine connect to a malicious CIFS server controlled by the attacker."
