1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This kernel update fixes the following security problems:
- CVE-2007-3104: The sysfs\_readdir function in the Linux kernel 2.6
allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel OOPS)
by dereferencing a null pointer to an inode in a dentry.
- CVE-2007-4997: A 2 byte buffer underflow in the ieee80211 stack
was fixed, which might be used by attackers in the local WLAN reach
to crash the machine.
- CVE-2007-3740: The CIFS filesystem, when Unix extension support is
enabled, did not honor the umask of a process, which allowed local
users to gain privileges.
- CVE-2007-4573: It was possible for local user to become root by
exploiting a bug in the IA32 system call emulation. This problem
affects the x86\_64 platform only, on all distributions.
This problem was fixed for regular kernels, but had not been fixed
for the XEN kernels. This update fixes the problem also for the
XEN kernels.
- CVE-2007-4308: The (1) aac\_cfg\_open and (2) aac\_compat\_ioctl
functions in the SCSI layer ioctl path in aacraid did not check
permissions for ioctls, which might have allowed local users to
cause a denial of service or gain privileges.
- CVE-2007-3843: The Linux kernel checked the wrong global variable
for the CIFS sec mount option, which might allow remote attackers to
spoof CIFS network traffic that the client configured for security
signatures, as demonstrated by lack of signing despite sec=ntlmv2i
in a SetupAndX request.
- CVE-2007-5904: Multiple buffer overflows in CIFS VFS in the Linux
kernel allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
and possibly execute arbitrary code via long SMB responses that
trigger the overflows in the SendReceive function.
This requires the attacker to mis-present / replace a CIFS server
the client machine is connected to.
Also the exploitability of this problem is not known.
- CVE-2007-6063: Buffer overflow in the isdn\_net\_setcfg function in
isdn\_net.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to have an
unknown impact via a crafted argument to the isdn\_ioctl function.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.

You are correct that the CIFS code calls SendReceive in cases in which
the buffer may be too small to fit a large SMB response, and that
should be fixed (e.g. to avoid possible overflows due to a server
bug), None of the eight cases (SMB TreeDisconnect, SMB uLogoff, SMB
Close, SMB FindClose etc.) in which a small buffer is passed in to
SendReceive return more than a few dozen bytes (and they are fixed
size responses), but I agree that we have to be safe (and we have seen
at least one server corrupt the bcc in the ulogoffX response and
another on the NTCreateX response) so it would be good to fix.

There are probably better ways to handle this though than passing in
the buffer size as your patch does.   Since there are only two buffer
sizes that CIFS uses - it would be easier to pass in (or out) a flag
which indicates the buffer size.  But the function SendReceive2
already does that - and the easier way to handle this seems to be
changing the eight places in fs/cifs/cifssmb.c which call
small_smb_init and then call SendReceive, to call SendReceive2
instead.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Linux kernel in the SUSE Linux Enterprise Realtime 10 SP1 product
was updated to fix the following security problems. Our other products have
already received those fixes.
- CVE-2008-0001: Incorrect access mode checks could be used by local
attackers to corrupt directory contents and so cause denial of
service attacks or potentially execute code.
- CVE-2008-0600: A local privilege escalation was found in
the vmsplice\_pipe system call, which could be used by local attackers
to gain root access.
- CVE-2007-5500: A buggy condition in the ptrace attach logic can
be used by local attackers to hang the machine.
- CVE-2007-5501: The tcp\_sacktag\_write\_queue function in
net/ipv4/tcp\_input.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (crash) via crafted ACK responses that trigger a NULL
pointer dereference.
- CVE-2007-5904: Multiple buffer overflows in CIFS VFS allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via long SMB responses that trigger the overflows
in the SendReceive function.
This problem requires the attacker to set up a malicious Samba/CIFS
server and getting the client to connect to it.
No other bugs were fixed.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart the machine after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hello all,

I was looking at CIFS VFS code recently, trying to solve other issue,
just to find something that looks like a buffer overflow  bug.
The problem is in SendReceive() function in transport.c - it memcpy's
message payload into a buffer passed via out_buf param. The function
assumes that all buffers are of size (CIFSMaxBufSize +
MAX_CIFS_HDR_SIZE) , unfortunately it is also called with smaller
(MAX_CIFS_SMALL_BUFFER_SIZE) buffers.

To check this finding I patched Samba server to send oversized logoffX
messages. With ~ 16kB messages the client running 2.6.23.1 crashed upon
unmounting.

I've done a quick fix, available here:
<http://czajnick.sitenet.pl/cifs-buffer-overflow-fix.patch.gz>

## Details

It was discovered that the ALSA /proc interface did not write the

correct number of bytes when reporting memory allocations. A local

attacker might be able to access sensitive kernel memory, leading to

a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2007-4571](/security/CVE-2007-4571))

Multiple buffer overflows were discovered in the handling of CIFS

filesystems. A malicious CIFS server could cause a client system crash

or possibly execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. ([CVE-2007-5904](/security/CVE-2007-5904))

It was discovered that PowerPC kernels did not correctly handle reporting

certain system details. By requesting a specific set of information,

a local attacker could cause a system crash resulting in a denial

of service. ([CVE-2007-6694](/security/CVE-2007-6694))

It was discovered that some device driver fault handlers did not

correctly verify memory ranges. A local attacker could exploit this

to access sensitive kernel memory, possibly leading to a loss of privacy.

([CVE-2008-0007](/security/CVE-2008-0007))

It was discovered that CPU resource limits could be bypassed.

A malicious local user could exploit this to avoid administratively

imposed resource limits. ([CVE-2008-1294](/security/CVE-2008-1294))

A race condition was discovered between dnotify fcntl() and close() in

the kernel. If a local attacker performed malicious dnotify requests,

they could cause memory consumption leading to a denial of service,

or possibly send arbitrary signals to any process. ([CVE-2008-1375](/security/CVE-2008-1375))

On SMP systems, a race condition existed in fcntl(). Local attackers

could perform malicious locks, causing system crashes and leading to

a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-1669](/security/CVE-2008-1669))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-386,

linux-powerpc, linux-amd64-generic), a standard system upgrade will

automatically perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Linux kernel update was updated on openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 to fix
the following security problems:
CVE-2008-2136: A problem in SIT IPv6 tunnel handling could be used
by remote attackers to immediately crash the machine.
CVE-2007-6282: A remote attacker could crash the IPSec/IPv6 stack
by sending a bad ESP packet. This requires the host to be able to
receive such packets (default filtered by the firewall).
CVE-2007-5904: A remote buffer overflow in CIFS was fixed which
could potentially be used by remote attackers to crash the machine
or potentially execute code.
CVE-2008-1615: On x86\_64 a denial of service attack could be used by
local attackers to immediately panic / crash the machine.
CVE-2008-2358: A security problem in DCCP was fixed, which could be
used by remote attackers to crash the machine. Only a fix for openSUSE
10.2 was necessary.
CVE-2008-2148: The permission checking in sys\_utimensat was incorrect
and local attackers could change the file times of files they do not
own to the current time.
CVE-2007-6206: An information leakage during core dumping of root
processes was fixed. This problem was already fixed for openSUSE 10.3
previously and was now fixed for openSUSE 10.2.
CVE-2007-6712: A integer overflow in the hrtimer\_forward function
(hrtimer.c) in Linux kernel, when running on 64-bit systems, allows
local users to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a timer
with a large expiry value, which causes the timer to always be expired.
CVE-2008-1669: Fixed a SMP ordering problem in fcntl\_setlk could
potentially allow local attackers to execute code by timing file
locking.
CVE-2008-1367: Clear the "direction" flag before calling signal
handlers. For specific not yet identified programs under specific
timing conditions this could potentially have caused memory corruption
or code execution.
CVE-2008-1375: Fixed a dnotify race condition, which could be used
by local attackers to potentially execute code.
CVE-2007-5500: A ptrace bug could be used by local attackers to hang
their own processes indefinitely.
Also various non security bugs were fixed, please see the RPM changelogs.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
