Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Wikepage application. Specifically, the "PageContent" and "PageName" parameters in `index.php` are not properly sanitized before being displayed back to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of input sanitization leads to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and script code into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code within a user's browser session. This code executes in the context of the vulnerable website.
- **Session Hijacking/Data Theft:** An attacker can use injected scripts to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, modify page content, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by crafting malicious URLs or form submissions containing malicious code in the "PageContent" and "PageName" parameters.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs to lure a user into accessing the crafted malicious link or submitting a form with the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs or form submissions to inject the XSS payload.
- No special network access is needed beyond normal internet access to target a vulnerable Wikepage instance.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Wikepage Opus 13 2007.2. Other versions of Wikepage, as well as Tipiwiki2 (from which Wikepage is derived), may also be affected.
- The provided blog post includes a note about Wikepage's derivation from Tipiwiki2, indicating that the same vulnerability likely exists in current versions of Tipiwiki2 due to the similar structure.
- The recommended solution is to edit the source code to properly sanitize input.
