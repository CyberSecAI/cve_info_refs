How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## 2. Avaya System Products using a Sun Microsystems Operating System:

Some Avaya system products are
delivered with an Operating System
from Sun Microsystems. Actions to be
taken on these products are described
below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya CMS | R15 | Low | This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya IR | 3.0, 4.0 | Low | IR does not use or support libpng by default. Avaya will not test patch for use with IR. |

**Recommended Actions:**

Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

## 3. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

Earlier today we [released an update](http://code.google.com/android/download.html) to the Android SDK – we're calling it m5-rc15. With this update, the SDK now includes all of the incremental changes we've been making to the [online documentation](http://code.google.com/android/documentation.html) since m5-rc14 was released in mid-February. In addition to the latest documentation, we've also fixed a security issue involving handling of image files.

We recommend that you [install](http://code.google.com/android/intro/installing.html) m5-rc15 at your earliest convenience. The update doesn't change any of the Android APIs or introduce any new ones. Eclipse users don't need to update the ADT plug-in either.

Once you've unzipped the file on your machine, you will want to update things like your `PATH` variable and, if you're using Eclipse, the SDK location setting for ADT (hint: `Preferences > Android`).
