Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5011:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure in the WebBatch application to properly sanitize user-supplied input. This lack of input sanitization allows for the injection of malicious script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is susceptible to XSS attacks due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary script code within the browser of an unsuspecting user who visits the affected website.
- **Cookie Theft:** The attacker can steal cookie-based authentication credentials.
- **Further Attacks:** Successful XSS exploitation can be leveraged to launch other attacks.
- **Remote System Information Exposure:** An attacker can use specific URL parameters to expose remote system information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Client:** The attack is initiated through a web client by crafting malicious URLs and sending them to the user.
- **Malicious URLs:**  Attackers can inject malicious script via the following web client paths:
    - `/webcgi/webbatch.exe?XSS`
    - `/webcgi/webbatch.exe?PATH/XSS`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not require local access and can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- **Target Interaction:** The attacker must trick the user into accessing the crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable file is `webbatch.exe`.
- The vulnerability is classified as an "Input Validation Error".
- The affected platform is Windows Servers.
- The vendor is Wilson WindowWare, Inc.
- The product is WebBatch.
- Specific URL parameters can be used to expose remote system information: `/webcgi/webbatch.exe?dumpinputdata`
