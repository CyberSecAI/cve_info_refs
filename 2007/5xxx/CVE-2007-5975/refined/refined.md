- Root cause of vulnerability: The 'choice' parameter passed to the index.php script is not properly sanitized.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL injection vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject SQL queries, potentially gaining full read access to the database and reading secret information.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the 'choice' parameter in the HTTP request to the index.php script.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
