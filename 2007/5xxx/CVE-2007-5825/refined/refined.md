Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2007-5825:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a format string vulnerability in the `ws_addarg` function within the `webserver.c` file of the mt-daapd (Firefly Media Server) software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The `ws_addarg` function doesn't properly sanitize username and password data extracted from the "Authorization: Basic" HTTP header. This allows an attacker to inject format string specifiers (like `%s`, `%x`, etc.) into the username or password fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the format string vulnerability, a remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the mt-daapd server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the `/xml-rpc` endpoint of the server.
- **Authorization Header:** The vulnerability is triggered by injecting format string specifiers within the username or password part of the base64 encoded "Authorization: Basic" header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running mt-daapd.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know how to construct the malicious HTTP request with the format string specifiers.
