        "vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Sun Java, including CVE-2007-5273, which is related to DNS rebinding attacks. The vulnerability arises because Java applets or JavaScript programs running within browsers do not pin DNS hostnames to a single IP address.",

        "impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted applet on a website or start an application in Java Web Start to execute arbitrary code outside of the Java sandbox and of the Java security restrictions with the privileges of the user running Java. The attacker could also obtain sensitive information, create, modify, rename and read local files, execute local applications, establish connections in the local network, bypass the same origin policy, and cause a Denial of Service via multiple vectors.",
