  "CVE-2007-5500": {
    "Description": "The Linux kernel is prone to a use-after-free vulnerability. This issue is due to a design error in the wait_task_stopped() function in kernel/exit.c. When ptrace and waitid are used, the kernel does not correctly check the task state, potentially causing a spinlock or a complete system hang.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from an incorrect check in the `wait_task_stopped` function within `kernel/exit.c`. The original test, `p->state > TASK_STOPPED`, intended to verify if a task was not dead. However, the introduction of `TASK_TRACED` and the state/exit_state split led to an incorrect modification, changing the test to `p->state & TASK_TRACED`. This was incorrect and needed to be changed again to check for `p->exit_state`. The incorrect check results in an infinite loop.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use-after-free",
       "Incorrect task state check",
       "Infinite loop",
      "Lack of proper handling in ptrace interactions with waitid",
	  "Incorrect handling of TASK_TRACED"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Local unprivileged users can cause a denial-of-service by triggering an infinite loop or system hang. The system may become unresponsive. In some cases, it may lead to a complete system crash.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Exploitation of ptrace and waitid functions",
       "Crafted programs/user actions"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local user with the ability to execute arbitrary programs is required. No special privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability, making it easily exploitable by any user on the system."
