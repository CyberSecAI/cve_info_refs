{
  "CVE-2007-5197": {
    "Description": "The Mono.Math.BigInteger class in Mono allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the reduction step of the Montgomery-based Pow methods of the BigInteger class within the Mono framework.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
       "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could send specially crafted data to Mono applications using the BigInteger class, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application (possibly root) or a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted data to Mono applications using the BigInteger class.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted data to a vulnerable Mono application, potentially over a network."
