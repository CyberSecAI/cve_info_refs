```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Picturesolution application, version 2.1 and earlier, has a remote file inclusion vulnerability due to an unsanitized "path" parameter in the config.php file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include a remote file, which could be a malicious script, allowing arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Attack vectors: By manipulating the "path" parameter in the URL of the config.php file to point to a malicious script hosted on an attacker-controlled server.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable server via the web and host a malicious file on a web server they control.
