  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2007-5344": {
      "details": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. The specific flaw exists in the handling of document objects that have been created, modified, deleted then accessed by JavaScript. By storing references to document nodes, then removing them by a separate reference, the document model in memory becomes unstable. Accessing the tags property while the document is in this unstable condition results in a heap corruption, allowing the execution of arbitrary code.",
      "impact": "Remote code execution",
      "attack_vector": "The user must visit a malicious page.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage. User interaction is required.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Heap corruption due to accessing the 'tags' property of a document in an unstable state"
      ],
       "root_cause": "Improper handling of document objects that have been created, modified, deleted and then accessed via JavaScript. Specifically, removing document nodes and then later accessing them through a reference causes a use-after-free condition."
