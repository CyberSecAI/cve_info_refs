1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- fetchmail remote denial of service attack
A remote denial-of-service attack was fixed in fetchmail.
This issue is tracked by the Mitre CVE ID CVE-2007-4565 and was
fixed for all SUSE Linux based products.
- flac integer overflows
Multiple integer overflows in flac could potentially be exploited
by attackers via specially crafted files to execute code in the
context of the user opening the file (CVE-2007-4619).
flac was updated on all affected distributions.
- Opera 9.24 security update
Opera was updated to version 9.24 to fix numerous defects including
some security problems. (CVE-2007-5540,CVE-2007-5541)
Opera is on SUSE Linux 10.0, 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 and was
updated there.
- util-linux mount setuid/setgid checking problem
Ludwig Nussel identified a problem in the handling of "user" mounts
in util-linux. The return value of setuid() was not checked.
This can only trigger if a mount point is listed as "user" in
/etc/fstab and if helpers are called. But those helpers have to be
setuid root anyway, so this problem is only academic in the current
setup and so just considered a regular bug.
We have fixed this bug for openSUSE 10.3 and future products.
This issue is tracked by Mitre CVE ID CVE-2007-5191.
- util-linux mount buffer overflow
Cryptographic enhancements in the losetup code in /sbin/mount done
by us during the openSUSE 10.3 development introduced a stack based
buffer overflow, which could potentially be used to execute code.
We have a released an updated util-linux package for openSUSE 10.3
fixing this bug.
This would have likely have been caught by the stack overflow
protection mechanisms, but we have not cross checked this.
- openssh X11 cookie and SIGALRM fixes
A bug in was fixed in openssh's X11 cookie handling code. It does
not properly handle the situation when an untrusted cookie cannot be
created and uses a trusted X11 cookie instead. This allows attackers
to violate the intended policy and gain privileges by causing an
X client to be treated as trusted. (CVE-2007-4752)
Additionally this update fixes a bug introduced with the last
security update for openssh. When the SSH daemon wrote to stderr (for
instance, to warn about the presence of a deprecated option like
PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt in its configuration file), SIGALRM was
blocked for SSH sessions. This resulted in problems with processes
which rely on SIGALRM, such as ntpdate.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Opera: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200710-31**

Opera contains multiple vulnerabilities, which may allow the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/opera** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **9.24** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **9.24** |

### Background

Opera is a multi-platform web browser.

### Description

Michael A. Puls II discovered an unspecified flaw when launching
external email or newsgroup clients (CVE-2007-5541). David Bloom
discovered that when displaying frames from different websites, the
same-origin policy is not correctly enforced (CVE-2007-5540).

### Impact

An attacker could potentially exploit the first vulnerability to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Opera by
enticing a user to visit a specially crafted URL. Note that this
vulnerability requires an external e-mail or newsgroup client
configured in Opera to be exploitable. The second vulnerability allows
an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser
session in context of other sites or the theft of browser credentials.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time for all these
vulnerabilities.

### Resolution

All Opera users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/opera-9.24"
```

Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
