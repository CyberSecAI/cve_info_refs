{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `exec()` function in `inc/exif.inc.php` is vulnerable because it uses unsanitized input from the `$exif_prog` parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote command execution vulnerability due to use of `exec()` with user-controlled input.",
       "Lack of input sanitization."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "Direct HTTP request to the vulnerable script `inc/exif.inc.php` with a malicious payload in the `exif_prog` parameter.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable script. The server must have PHP's \"globals on\" setting enabled to expose the `$exif_prog` parameter."
