# Linux Terminal Server Project: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200805-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in components shipped with
LTSP which allow remote attackers to compromise terminal clients.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/ltsp** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.0** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

The Linux Terminal Server Project adds thin-client support to Linux
servers.

### Description

LTSP version 4.2, ships prebuilt copies of programs such as the Linux
Kernel, the X.org X11 server (GLSA 200705-06, GLSA 200710-16, GLSA
200801-09), libpng (GLSA 200705-24, GLSA 200711-08), Freetype (GLSA
200705-02, GLSA 200705-22) and OpenSSL (GLSA 200710-06, GLSA 200710-30)
which were subject to multiple security vulnerabilities since 2006.
Please note that the given list of vulnerabilities might not be
exhaustive.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly exploit vulnerabilities in the
aforementioned programs and execute arbitrary code, disclose sensitive
data or cause a Denial of Service within LTSP 4.2 clients.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

LTSP 4.2 is not maintained upstream in favor of version 5. Since
version 5 is not yet available in Gentoo, the package has been masked.
We recommend that users unmerge LTSP:

```
 # emerge --unmerge net-misc/ltsp
```

If you have a requirement for Linux Terminal Servers, please either set
up a terminal server by hand or use one of the distributions that
already migrated to LTSP 5. If you want to contribute to the
integration of LTSP 5 in Gentoo, or want to follow its development,
find details in bug 177580.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Earlier today we [released an update](http://code.google.com/android/download.html) to the Android SDK – we're calling it m5-rc15. With this update, the SDK now includes all of the incremental changes we've been making to the [online documentation](http://code.google.com/android/documentation.html) since m5-rc14 was released in mid-February. In addition to the latest documentation, we've also fixed a security issue involving handling of image files.

We recommend that you [install](http://code.google.com/android/intro/installing.html) m5-rc15 at your earliest convenience. The update doesn't change any of the Android APIs or introduce any new ones. Eclipse users don't need to update the ADT plug-in either.

Once you've unzipped the file on your machine, you will want to update things like your `PATH` variable and, if you're using Eclipse, the SDK location setting for ADT (hint: `Preferences > Android`).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## 2. Avaya System Products using a Sun Microsystems Operating System:

Some Avaya system products are
delivered with an Operating System
from Sun Microsystems. Actions to be
taken on these products are described
below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya CMS | R15 | Low | This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya IR | 3.0, 4.0 | Low | IR does not use or support libpng by default. Avaya will not test patch for use with IR. |

**Recommended Actions:**

Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

# libpng: Multiple Denials of Service — GLSA **200711-08**

Several vulnerabilities in libpng may allow a remote attacker to crash
applications that handle untrusted images.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/libpng** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.21-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.21-r3** |

### Background

libpng is a free ANSI C library used to process and manipulate PNG
images.

### Description

An off-by-one error when handling ICC profile chunks in the
png\_set\_iCCP() function was discovered (CVE-2007-5266). George Cook and
Jeff Phillips reported several errors in pngrtran.c, the use of logical
instead of a bitwise functions and incorrect comparisons
(CVE-2007-5268). Tavis Ormandy reported out-of-bounds read errors in
several PNG chunk handling functions (CVE-2007-5269).

### Impact

A remote attacker could craft an image that when processed or viewed by
an application using libpng would cause the application to terminate
abnormally.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libpng users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libpng-1.2.21-r3"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Tobias Heinlein (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-09 14:51:10 UTC  ``` Some vulnerabilities have been reported in libpng, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).  1) Certain errors within libpng, including a logical NOT instead of a bitwise NOT in pngtrtran.c, an error in the 16bit cheap transparency extension, and an incorrect use of sizeof() may be exploited to crash an application using the library.  2) Various out-of-bounds read errors exist within the functions "png_handle_pCAL()", "png_handle_sCAL()", "png_push_read_tEXt()", "png_handle_iTXt()", and "png_handle_ztXt()", which may be exploited by exploited to crash an application using the library.  The vulnerabilities are reported in versions prior to 1.2.21.  Solution: Update to version 1.2.21. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tobias Heinlein (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-09 14:53:47 UTC  ``` Base-system, please advise. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tobias Heinlein (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-09 14:58:32 UTC  ``` I asked on #-dev whether I should file this bug, Cardoe told me I should. A few minutes later he noticed that the bugs have been introcued in 1.2.19, so our latest stable version should be invulnerable. Closing, sorry for the noise (for the second time even). ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Doug Goldstein (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-09 16:52:03 UTC  ``` <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=3.0.6.32.20071004082318.012a7628%40mail.comcast.net&forum_name=png-mng-implement>  Appears to be the discussion on the issue.   They introduced at least one new issue into 1.2.21 via [bug #194864](show_bug.cgi?id=194864 "RESOLVED FIXED - media-libs/libpng-1.2.21 causes several KDE apps to crash/not start"). Right now we have 1.2.21-r2 in the tree which patches the issue discussed at <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=47067C84.7010205%40playstation.sony.com&forum_name=png-mng-implement>  However, the patch doesn't look right to me and a user is still having issues. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Doug Goldstein (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-09 16:53:06 UTC  ``` I believe only one of the security issues was introduced in 1.2.19, the other existed before hand as well. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2007-10-14 21:26:36 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 195387](show_bug.cgi?id=195387 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - [STABLEREQ] >media-libs/libpng-1.2.21") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2007-10-14 21:29:10 UTC  ``` latest version in the tree is stable for everyone now ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-14 21:43:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=195261#c4)) > I believe only one of the security issues was introduced in 1.2.19, the other > existed before hand as well.  cardoe, which of them? ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Doug Goldstein (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-14 22:22:41 UTC  ``` I don't know exactly right now. I looked at the code on Tuesday and found one of the CVE's only really applied to .19 and higher. However there's still 2 other security issues which affect all releases of 1.2.x so it doesn't matter much. libpng's official site just says versions before 1.2.22 are vulnerable. Just looking at some of the patches Mike and I had to apply to 1.2.21 and looking at the diff between 1.2.21, they fixed a lot of code that someone should be ashamed of writing. I'd feel better if we stabilized 1.2.22 and just went with that as our security release rather then backport stuff to 1.2.21. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-15 22:39:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=195261#c8)) > I'd feel better if we stabilized 1.2.22 and just > went with that as our security release rather then backport stuff to 1.2.21.  If you feel that stabilization of .21 introduced or might introduce regressions or .22 is more suited for current stable, we can do this here.  ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-15 22:41:50 UTC  ``` To sum up the issues fixed here:  CVE-2007-5269:          Certain chunk handlers in libpng before 1.0.29 and 1.2.x before 1.2.21          allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via          crafted (1) pCAL (png_handle_pCAL), (2) sCAL (png_handle_sCAL), (3)          tEXt (png_push_read_tEXt), (4) iTXt (png_handle_iTXt), and (5) ztXT          (png_handle_ztXt) chunking in PNG images, which trigger out-of-bounds          read operations. CVE-2007-5268:          pngrtran.c in libpng before 1.0.29 and 1.2.x before 1.2.21 use (1)          logical instead of bitwise operations and (2) incorrect comparisons,          which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service          (crash) via a crafted PNG image. CVE-2007-5266:          Off-by-one error in ICC profile chunk handling in the png_set_iCCP          function in pngset.c in libpng before 1.0.29 beta1 and 1.2.x before          1.2.21 beta1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service          (crash) via a crafted PNG image that prevents a name field from being          NULL terminated.  Plus: "another crash bug (related to the ICC-profile chunk) remains to be fixed in version 1.2.22."  ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-17 19:19:48 UTC  ``` I vote NO. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-20 09:47:20 UTC  ``` that's A3 so no need to vote here... GLSA request filed. ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-26 00:08:03 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=195261#c9)) > (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=195261#c8)) > > I'd feel better if we stabilized 1.2.22 and just > > went with that as our security release rather then backport stuff to 1.2.21. >  > If you feel that stabilization of .21 introduced or might introduce regressions > or .22 is more suited for current stable, we can do this here.  Cardoe?  ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Doug Goldstein (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-29 14:48:58 UTC  ``` I was on vacation so that's why the non-response. But yes, I think 1.2.22 should be stabled instead of 1.2.21 since there technically are vulnerabilities still in 1.2.21. ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Tobias Heinlein (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-29 19:01:15 UTC  ``` Okay. Arch teams, please stabilise media-libs/libpng-1.2.22, targets are: "alpha amd64 arm hppa ia64 m68k mips ppc ppc64 s390 sh sparc ~sparc-fbsd x86 ~x86-fbsd". ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-29 22:26:12 UTC  ``` Adding arches ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Ferris McCormick (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-29 22:36:56 UTC  ``` Sparc stays ahead of the curve and is stable. ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Mike Doty (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-29 22:39:51 UTC  ``` removing solar at his request ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Dawid Węgliński (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-29 23:07:20 UTC  ``` Stable on x86 ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Jeroen Roovers (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-30 03:17:09 UTC  ``` Stable for HPPA. ```  [Comment 21](#c21)  Raúl Porcel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-30 18:18:37 UTC  ``` alpha/ia64 stable ```  [Comment 22](#c22)  Markus Rothe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-30 18:59:17 UTC  ``` ppc64 stable ```  [Comment 23](#c23)  Daniel Gryniewicz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-30 19:24:26 UTC  ``` amd64 done. ```  [Comment 24](#c24)  Tobias Scherbaum (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-30 19:35:10 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 25](#c25)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-30 23:55:21 UTC  ``` GLSA was already filed. ```  [Comment 26](#c26)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-07 20:34:54 UTC  ``` GLSA 200711-08 ``` |  |
