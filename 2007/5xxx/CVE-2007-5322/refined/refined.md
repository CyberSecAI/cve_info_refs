Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5322:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `FPOLE.OCX` ActiveX control of Microsoft Visual FoxPro 6.0.
- The `FoxDoCmd()` method of this control can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Unsafe use of the `FoxDoCmd()` method allows attackers to run shell commands through the ActiveX control.
-  The control is marked as "Safe for untrusted: caller", which incorrectly suggests it is safe to use even in untrusted contexts.
- Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the fact that the ActiveX control does not properly validate the command passed to `FoxDoCmd()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution on the target system.
- Attackers can potentially gain complete control of the user's computer, install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a specially crafted webpage or HTML email.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into accessing the malicious content through a web browser or through the viewing of an HTML email.
- Once the page is loaded, the ActiveX control attempts to execute the attacker's arbitrary commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or distribute a malicious HTML file or send a malicious HTML email.
- The victim needs to have Microsoft Visual FoxPro 6.0 installed, with the vulnerable ActiveX control registered.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable ActiveX control and its `FoxDoCmd()` method.
- The attacker needs the capability to deliver the malicious HTML content to a target using a web browser.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided exploit code uses VBScript within an HTML page.
- The exploit provided by exploit-db demonstrates the execution of `notepad.exe` as a proof of concept, but could execute any command.
- The vulnerability is present in FPOLE.OCX version 6.0.8450.0.
- The ActiveX control is marked as "RegKey Safe for Script: False" and "RegKey Safe for Init: False"
