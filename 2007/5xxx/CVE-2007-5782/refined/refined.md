{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The dl.php script in FireConfig v0.5 does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for directory traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially revealing sensitive information such as configuration files, system files (e.g., /etc/passwd), or application source code.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the dl.php script with a manipulated 'file' parameter. The attacker can use path traversal sequences like '../../' to navigate to parent directories and access files outside the intended directory.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required.",
    "details": "The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the vulnerability by using the following GET request: `/dl.php?file=../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`. The null byte (%00) is used to truncate the file path after /etc/passwd, to ensure the server returns the requested file."
