Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `product_desc.php` script. Specifically, the `id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is an **SQL Injection** vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize or properly escape user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive data stored in the database, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential information.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker might be able to modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** By querying specific tables (e.g., `sbauctions_admin`), attackers can potentially retrieve admin credentials and gain unauthorized access to administrative functions.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through the `product_desc.php` script, specifically by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.
    *   Example: `http://sitename/product_desc.php?id=<SQL C0de>` where `<SQL C0de>` contains the malicious SQL payload.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
    *   The attacker doesn't require prior authentication.

*   **Specific exploit details:**
    *   The provided SQL code `999999%20union/**/select/**/0,1,admin_name,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,pwd,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35/**/from/**/sbauctions_admin/*` demonstrates a `UNION SELECT` injection technique. This allows the attacker to extract data from the `sbauctions_admin` table, specifically the `admin_name` and `pwd` fields.

This exploit allows to retrieve admin username and password from the vulnerable website.
