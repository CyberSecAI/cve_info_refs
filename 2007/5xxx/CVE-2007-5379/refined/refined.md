Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2007-5379:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `Hash.from_xml` method within Ruby on Rails, which utilizes `XmlSimple` in an unsafe manner. Specifically, the XML parser could be manipulated via crafted requests to read files from the server's disk or the network.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsafe XML Parsing:** The `Hash.from_xml` method, relying on `XmlSimple`, did not properly sanitize XML input. This allowed for the potential inclusion of malicious instructions to read arbitrary files on the server or network.
- **File Disclosure:** Attackers could exploit the unsafe XML parsing to read sensitive files on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive information, such as configuration files and potentially passwords, by reading arbitrary files on the server.
- **Arbitrary File Access:** The vulnerability allowed for the reading of any accessible XML files on the server or network, leading to potential data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted Requests:** Attackers could send crafted HTTP requests to a Rails application that included malicious XML input.
- **ActiveResource Server Interaction:** ActiveResource servers could also be exploited by sending malicious XML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** Attackers could exploit the vulnerability remotely by sending malicious requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of XML Structure:** Some knowledge of XML structure and how `XmlSimple` was used would likely be required to craft effective attacks.
