Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw in PhFiTo version 1.3.0.
*   The code in `phfito-post.php` includes a file based on the `$SRC_PATH` variable without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly uses user-supplied input (`$SRC_PATH`) to include files, allowing an attacker to include remote files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file from a remote server they control. This allows them to potentially gain full control of the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `phfito-post.php`, manipulating the `SRC_PATH` parameter.
*   Example: `/phfito/phfito-post?SRC_PATH=[URL to malicious file]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server to send HTTP requests.
*   **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker needs a publicly accessible server to host the malicious file that will be included in the vulnerable application.
