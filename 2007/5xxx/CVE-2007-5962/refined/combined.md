##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=397011#c0)  Martin Nagy    2007-11-23 15:51:42 UTC  ``` Description of problem: There is a memory leak that causes memory to be allocated but not freed. When the deny_file option is set, it is possible to easily exploit this. This is a regression caused by applied patch in [bz174764](show_bug.cgi?id=174764 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - deny_file seems to not work"). Problem also exists in FC-6, F-7, F-8 and fedora/devel. Attached is a patch to solve the problem.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): vsftpd-2.0.5-10.el5  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: # echo deny_file=foo >> /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf # service vsftpd restart  $ cat > memtest.sh << EOF #!/bin/bash echo USER anonymous echo PASS foo  while [ 1 ]; do         echo CWD pub         echo CWD .. done EOF  $ chmod 700 memtest.sh $ ./memtest.sh | telnet localhost 21 > /dev/null  Actual results: vsftpd starts to allocate memory that will never be freed.  Expected results:   Additional info: It is possible that the memory leak can be exploited by other means, or with other vsftpd.conf options. This was not investigated into more depth.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=397011#c1)  Martin Nagy    2007-11-23 15:51:42 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 267651](attachment.cgi?id=267651&action=diff "fix the vsftpd-2.0.4-filter.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=267651&action=edit "fix the vsftpd-2.0.4-filter.patch") fix the vsftpd-2.0.4-filter.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=397011#c2)  RHEL Program Management    2007-11-23 16:05:19 UTC  ``` This bugzilla has Keywords: Regression.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=397011#c0)  Martin Nagy    2007-11-23 15:51:42 UTC  ``` Description of problem: There is a memory leak that causes memory to be allocated but not freed. When the deny_file option is set, it is possible to easily exploit this. This is a regression caused by applied patch in [bz174764](show_bug.cgi?id=174764 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - deny_file seems to not work"). Problem also exists in FC-6, F-7, F-8 and fedora/devel. Attached is a patch to solve the problem.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): vsftpd-2.0.5-10.el5  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: # echo deny_file=foo >> /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf # service vsftpd restart  $ cat > memtest.sh << EOF #!/bin/bash echo USER anonymous echo PASS foo  while [ 1 ]; do         echo CWD pub         echo CWD .. done EOF  $ chmod 700 memtest.sh $ ./memtest.sh | telnet localhost 21 > /dev/null  Actual results: vsftpd starts to allocate memory that will never be freed.  Expected results:   Additional info: It is possible that the memory leak can be exploited by other means, or with other vsftpd.conf options. This was not investigated into more depth.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=397011#c1)  Martin Nagy    2007-11-23 15:51:42 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 267651](attachment.cgi?id=267651&action=diff "fix the vsftpd-2.0.4-filter.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=267651&action=edit "fix the vsftpd-2.0.4-filter.patch") fix the vsftpd-2.0.4-filter.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=397011#c2)  RHEL Program Management    2007-11-23 16:05:19 UTC  ``` This bugzilla has Keywords: Regression.

Subject: vsftpd CVE-2007-5962 (Red Hat / Fedora specific)

Hi Chris!

This is just a heads-up.  We are releasing updated vsftpd packages
containing a fix for a minor memory leak identified by CVE-2007-5962.

The issue occurred because of the Red Hat / Fedora specific patch
which, according to information from our vsftpd maintainer, is not in
upstream.  I also checked few major vendors, it seems no one is using
the patch.

More details in our BZ:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2007-5962>

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

The memory leak itself is CVE-2007-5962? Or is the CVE for the original
issue where deny_hosts didn't work as expected? It doesn't seem to be
public.

rPath/Foresight does :-/

Thanks for the heads-up.
