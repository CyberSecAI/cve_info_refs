  "CVE-2007-5989": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Skype. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.  The specific flaw exists within the 'skype4com' URI handler created by Skype during installation. When processing short string values through this handler an exploitable memory corruption may occur which can result in arbitrary code execution under the context of the current user.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists within the 'skype4com' URI handler when processing short string values.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution under the context of the current user.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attackers can exploit this by tricking a user into visiting a malicious webpage.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage."
