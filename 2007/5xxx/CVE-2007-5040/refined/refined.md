{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper implementation of System Service Dispatch Table (SSDT) hooks in multiple security software products.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Vulnerable software products use SSDT hooks, but their implementations contain vulnerabilities. The exact nature of the vulnerability is not provided in this content, but the provided advisory and article links might contain this information.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The content indicates that the risk is 'High' and that both local and remote exploitation are possible. The exact impact is not defined, but may lead to denial of service, system instability, and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves exploiting vulnerabilities present in the implementation of SSDT hooks. This could be local or remote.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be able to trigger the vulnerable SSDT hooks. This can be done locally or remotely."
