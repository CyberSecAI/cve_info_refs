Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-5695:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `command.php` script in SiteBar does not properly validate the `forward` parameter when handling the "Log In" action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unvalidated Redirect:** The application blindly uses the value of the `forward` parameter in a redirect header, without checking if it's a valid internal URL or an external malicious URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Redirect:** An attacker can redirect a user to an arbitrary website after a successful login. This can be used for phishing attacks, credential harvesting, or other malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET request:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the vulnerable `command.php` script, specifying the "Log In" action and providing the attacker's URL in the `forward` parameter.
    
    Example:
    `http://<sitebar-server>/command.php?command=Log%20In&forward=http://www.malicious-site.com/`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that points to the vulnerable SiteBar instance.
*   The attacker does not necessarily need to be authenticated. They are manipulating the login process, and if successful, can force a redirect of a legitimate user after authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a larger set of security issues affecting SiteBar, as described in the provided advisory. Other related CVEs include CVE-2007-5491, CVE-2007-5492, CVE-2007-5692, CVE-2007-5693, and CVE-2007-5694.
*   The fix for this issue involves sanitizing the `forward` parameter to prevent redirects to external sites. The patched version (3.3.9 and later) includes this fix.
*   The vulnerability is considered "remote exploitable" which means an attacker can execute it remotely through a network without needing local access.

This information is consistent with the description in the Debian Security Advisory (DSA-1423-1), which specifically mentions "An error in command.php allows remote attackers to redirect users to arbitrary web sites via the forward parameter in a Log In action."
