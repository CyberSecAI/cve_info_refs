Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5085:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of access control on the Management EJB (MEJB) in Apache Geronimo. This allowed unauthenticated access to Geronimo internals through the MEJB interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of any security checks or authentication requirements for accessing the MEJB.
- **Exposed Internal Functionality:** The MEJB provided a direct interface to internal components and functions of the Geronimo application server, which should not have been exposed without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive internal information and potentially execute administrative functions within the Geronimo server.
- **Server Compromise:**  The lack of access control could allow an attacker to potentially compromise the entire application server if they could find functions to exploit.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The vulnerability was exploitable via network access to the Geronimo server's exposed MEJB interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Connectivity:** Attackers needed to have network connectivity to the target Geronimo server to exploit the unprotected MEJB.
- **Knowledge of MEJB Interface:** A basic understanding of the MEJB interface would be required, although the lack of access controls meant that attackers would have an easy time exploring available features.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided information indicates a critical severity due to potential server compromise.
- The issue was addressed in versions 2.0.2 and 2.1 of Apache Geronimo, by implementing configurable security for MEJB access.
- A temporary workaround was available by disabling MEJB by modifying the `config.xml` file.
- The JIRA ticket `GERONIMO-3456` was created to track the issue and its resolution.
- Several patches and diffs are attached to the JIRA ticket, indicating the different steps taken to fix the issue.
