As a temporary workaround you can modify the **`config.xml`** to disable MEJB.  To disable MEJB make the following modifications to the configuration file at **`<geronimo_home>/var/config.xml`**. **Excerpt from config.xml** ``` .... <module name="org.apache.geronimo.configs/openejb/2.0.1/car">     <gbean name="EJBNetworkService">     ...     </gbean>     <gbean load="false" name="ejb/mgmt/MEJB"/> </module> ...  ```  We will be releasing a new version soon to control access to MEJB in a more secure way. This issue will be tracked in JIRA [GERONIMO-3456](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GERONIMO-3456). |
