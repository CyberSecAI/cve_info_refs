# 3.0.1 and 3.1.1 Security Advisory

Tuesday, Sep 18th, 2007

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issue has been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* Even with account creation disabled, users can use the WebService to
  create an account.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Unauthorized Access
Affected:    2.23.3 and above.
Description: Bugzilla::WebService::User::offer_account_by_email does
             not check the "createemailregexp" parameter, and thus
             allows users to create accounts who would normally be
             denied account creation.
             The "emailregexp" parameter is still checked.
             If you do not have the SOAP::Lite Perl module installed on
             your Bugzilla system, your system is not vulnerable
             (because the Bugzilla WebService will not be enabled).
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=395632

Vulnerability Solutions
=======================

The fix for this issue is included in the
releases. Upgrading to a release with the relevant fix will

vulnerability, there are patches available for the issue at the
"References" URL.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6
Build Identifier: 3.0.1
Despite leaving createemailregexp parameter blank (disable account creation by email) it is possible to use Bugzilla::User::offer\_account\_by\_email. Any other kind of reular expression in createemailregexp is ignored, too.
It seems the value of createemailregexp is not checked.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. set createemailregexp to whatever you like
2. fill appropriate values into the folowing python script
import xmlrpclib
server\_proxy = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy( URL\_TO\_XMLRPCCGI )
server\_proxy.User.offer\_account\_by\_email( {'email':ANYMAILADDRESS} )
3. run the script

Tested; works as expected. r=Wurblzap.
I wonder whether we should rather move these checks from Bugzilla::WebService::User and createaccount.cgi both into Bugzilla::User::check\_login\_name\_for\_creation.

No, because an admin is free to create an account which doesn't satisfy createemailregexp. All the admin needs to know is whether the login name is already in use or not.

r=LpSolit for tip, but it needs a backport for 3.0.2 as account\_creation\_restricted doesn't exist there.

Agreed, for the reason given in [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=395632#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] XML-RPC WebService Bugzilla::User::offer_account_by_email does not check createemailregexp") (installations are no longer private)!

I still think we should move this check into Bugzilla::User::check\_login\_name\_for\_creation. editusers can pass it an override bit to say "don't check this" when it's an admin doing the creation from there. Making you do something extra to override it and having it checked by default otherwise no matter where you're checking from is much safer in the long run to prevent something like this from being introduced again by accident somewhere else.

|  | |

That has the potential of breaking other things, because it's not extremely simple in the Object->create framework (although it's definitely possible). I think we should stick with the simple fix for now and after the 3.0.2 and 3.1.2 release, we should move this stuff into check\_login\_name\_for\_creation.

Bah, I already complained in [bug 350232 comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=350232#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - Allow the Webservice interface to create User Accounts") a year ago about this security hole and you removed my r-!

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=299981#c0)  Adrian Reber    2007-09-21 11:31:39 UTC  ``` September 18, 2007  Summary =======  Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of software projects.  This advisory covers a critical security issue that has recently been fixed in the Bugzilla code:  * Even with account creation disabled, users can use the WebService to   create an account.  We strongly advise that 2.23.x and 3.0.x users upgrade to 3.0.2 immediately. Users of CVS HEAD or 3.1.1 should upgrade to 3.1.2 immediately. This is critical if you have a "requirelogin" installation and also have the WebService enabled.   Vulnerability Details =====================  Class:       Unauthorized Access Versions:    2.23.3 and above. Description: Bugzilla::WebService::User::offer_account_by_email does              not check the "createemailregexp" parameter, and thus              allows users to create accounts who would normally be              denied account creation.              The "emailregexp" parameter is still checked.              If you do not have the SOAP::Lite Perl module installed on              your Bugzilla system, your system is not vulnerable              (because the Bugzilla WebService will not be enabled).  Reference:   <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=395632>   Vulnerability Solutions =======================  The fix for the security bug mentioned in this advisory is included in the 3.0.2 and 3.1.2 releases. Upgrading to these releases will protect installations from possible exploits of this issue.  Full release downloads, patches to upgrade Bugzilla from previous versions, and CVS upgrade instructions are available at:    <http://www.bugzilla.org/download/>  If you are unable to upgrade, you should IMMEDIATELY apply the appropriate patch for your version:  2.23.x & 3.0.x: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=280385>          3.1.x: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=280316>   Credits =======  The Bugzilla team wish to thank the following people for their assistance in locating, advising us of, and assisting us to fix this issue:  Sascha Jensen FrÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ric Buclin Max Kanat-Alexander Marc Schumann  General information about the Bugzilla bug-tracking system can be found at:    <http://www.bugzilla.org/>  Comments and follow-ups can be directed to the mozilla.support.bugzilla newsgroup or the support-bugzilla mailing list. <http://www.bugzilla.org/support/> has directions for accessing these forums.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=299981#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2007-09-24 15:56:47 UTC  ``` CVE has assigned name [CVE-2007-5038](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-5038) to this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=299981#c2)  Fedora Update System    2007-09-25 08:32:19 UTC  ``` bugzilla-3.0.2-0.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |
