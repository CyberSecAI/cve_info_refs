Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5187:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content from exploit-db.com directly references CVE-2007-5187, confirming it's related. The exploit targets a specific PHP-Fusion module and describes the SQL injection vulnerability, which aligns with the CVE description which is related to SQL Injection.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    - The vulnerability lies in the `show_single.php` file of the `calendar_events_panel` module for PHP-Fusion. Specifically, the `sel` parameter was not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to insufficient input validation on the `$sel` parameter.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information such as user credentials (usernames and password hashes) from the database by crafting malicious SQL queries.
    - The provided exploit code specifically targets user password disclosure.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request with the malicious SQL payload injected into the `sel` parameter of the URL.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable PHP-Fusion installation.
    - **Knowledge of the vulnerable path**: The attacker needs to know the vulnerable path `/infusions/calendar_events_panel/show_single.php`
    - **Basic HTTP knowledge** The attacker needs to be able to send a GET request
    - **SQL knowledge**: The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL injection queries.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit code provided includes a check for a fixed bug, indicating that a patch may exist. It also highlights that line 27 is the location of the vulnerability and suggests a patch at line 26 that includes a type and isset check before processing the input.
*   The exploit demonstrates how to extract user credentials by injecting a SQL UNION statement into the vulnerable query and retrieves the username and password hashes from the user table.
*   The exploit uses the id of the user to retrieve the user's credentials, and requires this as input to the exploit.

In summary, the content provides a detailed description of a SQL injection vulnerability in a PHP-Fusion module, including the vulnerable code location, exploitation method, and impact of exploitation.
