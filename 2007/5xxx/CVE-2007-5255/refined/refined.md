Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Google Search Appliance search script. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the way the script handles user-supplied input in the `ie`, `site`, `client`, and `oe` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The search script does not properly sanitize or encode user-provided values in the `ie`, `site`, `client` and `oe` parameters before including them in the HTML response. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Stealing:** Attackers can steal cookies, which may contain sensitive information like session IDs and potentially passwords if not properly handled.
- **Redirection:** An attacker could redirect users to a malicious website.
- **Code Execution:** More advanced XSS attacks could potentially lead to code execution within the user's browser.
- **Other XSS Attacks:** Other malicious actions like defacing the page or injecting phishing forms are possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript code within the vulnerable parameters: `ie`, `site`, `client`, and `oe`.
- An attacker would need to entice a user to click on the crafted malicious link. This could be done through email, social media, or other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create malicious URLs and distribute them to potential victims.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the Google Search Appliance itself.
- The attacker leverages the fact that the application doesn't sanitize user input, and by injecting code via the parameters, they can control the browser of a victim

**Technical Details:**

The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) URL demonstrates the vulnerability:
`http://site/search?ie=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E&site=x&output=xml_no_dtd'&client=x&proxystylesheet=x`

In this example, the attacker injects the `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` into the `ie` parameter.  When the user's browser renders the page, the malicious script executes, showing the user's cookies.
