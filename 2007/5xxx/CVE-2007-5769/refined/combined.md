netkit-ftpd/ftp uninitialized vulnerability
Class: Design Error
DATE:11/1/2007
CVEID:CVE-2007-5769
Vulnerable:
	netkit-ftpd-0.17/netkit-ftp-0.17
Vendor:

I.Synopsis

A vulnerability has been discovered in netkit-ftpd/ftp.

II.DETAILS:
----------
Background

netkit-ftpd is the Linux Netkit FTP server with optional SSL support.
netkit-ftp is the client for the ftp protocol.

Description

	There is a uninitialized  vulnerability in function dataconn() in ftpd.c.
 	static FILE * dataconn(const char *name, off_t size, const char *mode)
 	{
 		char sizebuf[[32]](#32);
 		FILE *file;  <-uninit variable.

		...
			 if (SSL_accept(ssl_data_con)<=0) {
1459 				static char errbuf[1024];
1460
1461 				snprintf(errbuf, sizeof(errbuf), "ftpd: SSL_accept DATA error
%s\n",
1462 					    ERR_error_string(ERR_get_error(),NULL));
1463 				perror_reply(425, errbuf);
1464 				/* abort time methinks ... */
1465 				fclose(file); <-- close an uninit value.
1466 				return NULL;

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x6fca33fd in fclose () from /lib/libc.so.6
(gdb) bt
#0  0x6fca33fd in fclose () from /lib/libc.so.6
#1  0x0804c601 in dataconn (name=0x77add110 "/bin/ls", size=<value
optimized out>, mode=0x8053f4f "w") at ftpd.c:1465
#2  0x0804d3f8 in retrieve (cmd=0x80550c7 "/bin/ls -lgA",

#3  0x0805193a in yyparse () at ftpcmd.y:378
) at ftpd.c:685

in order to trigger this bug, the client should use the passive mode to
transfer data.
and  the SSL_accept should  failed at line ftpd.c:1458. the client broke
the connection
will cause the SSL_accept failed.

same problem occur in netkit-ftp's getreply() too.
467     int
468     getreply(int expecteof)
469     {
........
520                                             (void)
signal(SIGINT,oldintr);
521                                             code = 221;
522                                             return (0);
523                                     }
524                                     lostpeer(0);
525                                     fclose(cout);

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x6fcb73fd in fclose () from /lib/libc.so.6
(gdb) bt
#0  0x6fcb73fd in fclose () from /lib/libc.so.6

Impact
Reading uninitialized variables can result in unpredictable behavior,
crashes, or security holes.
