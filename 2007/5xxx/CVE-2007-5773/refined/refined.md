  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Flatnuke 3 File Manager module allows remote users to upload, create, edit, or delete files without proper authorization checks, leading to arbitrary file manipulation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure file handling",
      "Lack of proper authorization checks",
      "Vulnerable file manager module"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can overwrite or modify arbitrary files on the server, potentially gaining administrative access by modifying user profiles or uploading malicious PHP scripts.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Direct POST request to the vulnerable file manager module.",
      "Manipulation of 'ffile', 'dir', and 'body' parameters in the POST request.",
      "Full path disclosure to obtain the server's file path."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the server. They also need to know the path to the flatnuke installation to target files on the server.",
    "additional_information": "The exploit also mentions the possibility of using a full path disclosure vulnerability to gain the required file path information."
