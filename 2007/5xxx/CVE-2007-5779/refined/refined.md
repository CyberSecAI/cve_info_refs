```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `GomWeb3.dll` ActiveX control within GOM Player when handling URLs passed to the `OpenURL` method.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Buffer overflow.
- Impact of exploitation: Remote code execution is possible by overflowing the buffer with malicious code.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by passing an overly long URL to the `OpenURL` method of the ActiveX control, likely through a web page embedding the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to induce a user to load a malicious webpage which exploits the vulnerable ActiveX control.
