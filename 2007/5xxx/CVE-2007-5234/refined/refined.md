- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `footer.php` file in Ossigeno CMS version 2.2a3 includes a file using a variable named `$level` which is undefined. This allows for an attacker to control the included file.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote files on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `upload/common/footer.php` file and can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make a request to the vulnerable script and control the path of the included file to an attacker-controlled location.
