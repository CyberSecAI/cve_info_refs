How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### 3. Problem description:

I Service Console package security updates

#####

a. OpenPegasus PAM Authentication Buffer Overflow
Alexander Sotirov from VMware Security Research discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the OpenPegasus Management server.

This flaw could be exploited by a malicious remote user on the service console network to gain root access to the service console.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2007-5360 to this issue.

RPM Updated: pegasus-2.5-552927
VM Shutdown: No
Host Reboot: No

Note: ESX Server 3.5 and ESX Server 3i are not affected by this issue.

[kb.vmware.com/kb/1003176](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1003176)

ESX Server 2.5.x
Users should remove the OpenPegasus CIM Management rpm. This component is disabled by default, and VMware recommends that you do not use this component of ESX Server 2.x. If you want to use the CIM functionality, upgrade to ESX Server 3.0.1 or a later release.

Note: This vulnerability can be exploited remotely only if the attacker has access to the service console network.

Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the service console be isolated from the VM network. Please see [www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726](http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726) for more information on VMware security best practices.

#####

b. Updated Samba package
An issue where attackers on the service console management network can cause a stack-based buffer overflow in the reply\_netbios\_packet function of nmbd in Samba. On systems where Samba is being used as a WINS server, exploiting this vulnerability can allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted WINS Name Registration requests followed by a WINS Name Query request.

An issue where attackers on the service console management network can exploit a vulnerability that occurs when Samba is configured as a Primary or Backup Domain controller. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via crafted GETDC mailslot requests, related to handling of GETDC logon server requests.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CVE-2007-5398 and CVE-2007-4572 to these issues.

Note: By default Samba is not configured as a WINS server or a domain controller and ESX is not vulnerable unless the administrator has changed the default configuration.

This vulnerability can be exploited remotely only if the attacker has access to the service console network.

Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the service console be isolated from the VM network. Please see [www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726](http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726) for more information on VMware security best practices.

c. Updated util-linux package
The patch addresses an issue where the mount and umount utilities in util-linux call the setuid and setgid functions in the wrong order and do not check the return values, which could allow attackers to gain elevated privileges via helper application such as mount.nfs.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2007-5191 to this issue.

Debian Security Advisory 1409                        security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                               Steve Kemp
November 22, 2007                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : samba
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-4572, CVE-2007-5398

Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in samba,
a LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-5398

   Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research discovered that nmbd did not properly
   check the length of netbios packets. When samba is configured as a WINS
   server, a remote attacker could send multiple crafted requests resulting
   in the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.

CVE-2007-4572
   Samba developers discovered that nmbd could be made to overrun a buffer
   during the processing of GETDC logon server requests.  When samba is
   configured as a Primary or Backup Domain Controller, a remote attacker
   could send malicious logon requests and possibly cause a denial of
   service.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.24-6etch5.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.14a-3sarge7.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.27-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# Samba: Execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200711-29**

Samba contains two buffer overflow vulnerabilities potentially resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-fs/samba** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.0.27a** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.0.27a** |

### Background

Samba is a suite of SMB and CIFS client/server programs for UNIX.

### Description

Two vulnerabilities have been reported in nmbd. Alin Rad Pop (Secunia
Research) discovered a boundary checking error in the
reply\_netbios\_packet() function which could lead to a stack-based
buffer overflow (CVE-2007-5398). The Samba developers discovered a
boundary error when processing GETDC logon requests also leading to a
buffer overflow (CVE-2007-4572).

### Impact

To exploit the first vulnerability, a remote unauthenticated attacker
could send specially crafted WINS "Name Registration" requests followed
by a WINS "Name Query" request. This might lead to execution of
arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Note that this vulnerability
is exploitable only when WINS server support is enabled in Samba. The
second vulnerability could be exploited by sending specially crafted
"GETDC" mailslot requests, but requires Samba to be configured as a
Primary or Backup Domain Controller. It is not believed the be
exploitable to execute arbitrary code.

### Workaround

To work around the first vulnerability, disable WINS support in Samba
by setting "*wins support = no*" in the "global" section of your
smb.conf and restart Samba.

### Resolution

All Samba users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-fs/samba-3.0.27a"
```

The first vulnerability (CVE-2007-5398) was already fixed in Samba
3.0.26a-r2.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
