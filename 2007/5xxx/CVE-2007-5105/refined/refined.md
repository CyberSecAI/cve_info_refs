Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `wp-register.php` file of WordPress versions prior to 2.0.4. Specifically, the `user_email` parameter was not sanitized before being displayed on the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. The unsanitized `user_email` parameter allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the webpage, which is then executed in the victim's browser when the page is loaded.
*   The `user_login` parameter is also vulnerable in version 2.0 but is partially fixed in 2.0.1.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable website. This could lead to:
    *   **Cookie Theft:** Stealing session cookies to impersonate a logged-in user.
    *   **Redirecting Users:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the website.
    *   **Other Malicious Activities:** Performing other client-side attacks like keylogging, form grabbing etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is carried out using a specially crafted `POST` request to the `wp-register.php` page.
*   The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `user_email` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP `POST` requests to the vulnerable WordPress installation.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   The attacker must target sites where 'user registration' is enabled.
*   The attack is remote (can be launched from any location).

**Specific Details from Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** WordPress versions 2.0, 2.0.1 are confirmed to be vulnerable, with a fix in 2.0.4 and later.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `user_email` parameter is consistently vulnerable. The `user_login` parameter is also vulnerable in version 2.0, but is partially fixed in version 2.0.1.
*   **Exploitation Method:** The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrates how to inject JavaScript via the `user_email` parameter. It provides examples of:
    *   Simple alert popups.
    *   Cookie theft via redirecting hash locations.
    *   External script inclusion to execute external JS files.
*   **Vendor Response:** The author notes that they contacted the vendor but received no response.
