{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an insecure inclusion of a file based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability due to the lack of sanitization of the 'example' parameter in the `bbcodeSource.php` file.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `examples\\patExampleGen\\bbcodeSource.php` with the 'example' parameter pointing to a malicious PHP file hosted on a remote server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They need to know the location of the vulnerable file and the parameter name. They also need to host a malicious PHP file on an accessible server."
