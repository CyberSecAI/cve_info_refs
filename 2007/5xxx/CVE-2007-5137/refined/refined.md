My read on it is: for 5378, the\nsecond frame is LARGER than the first; for 5137, the second frame is\nSMALLER than the first.\n\nNote that another ID, CVE-2007-4851, was found to be a duplicate of\nCVE-2007-5137, so don't use 4851.\n\nBuffer overflow in the ReadImage function in generic/tkImgGIF.c in Tcl\n(Tcl/Tk) 8.4.13 through 8.4.15 allows remote attackers to execute\narbitrary code via multi-frame interlaced GIF files in which later\nframes are smaller than the first.  NOTE: this issue is due to an\nincorrect patch for CVE-2007-5378."

      "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the GIF image parsing code within the Tk library, specifically in the ReadImage function within `generic/tkImgGIF.c`. The vulnerability arises when handling multi-frame interlaced GIF files where subsequent frames are smaller than the initial frame. This occurs due to incorrect memory allocation logic when processing these images.",

      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted GIF image, likely through a malicious website or email.",
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious GIF file meeting the specific criteria of the vulnerability. The attacker needs to get the user to open the GIF using an application that uses the vulnerable Tk library."
