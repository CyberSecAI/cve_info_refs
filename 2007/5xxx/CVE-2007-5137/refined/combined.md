How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : libtk-img
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Ids        : CVE-2007-5137 CVE-2007-5378
Debian Bug     : 519072

Two buffer overflows have been found in the GIF image parsing code of
Tk, a cross-platform graphical toolkit, which could lead to the execution
of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-5137

It was discovered that libtk-img is prone to a buffer overflow via
specially crafted multi-frame interlaced GIF files.

CVE-2007-5378

It was discovered that libtk-img is prone to a buffer overflow via
specially crafted GIF files with certain subimage sizes.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3-release-7+lenny1.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3-15etch3.

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

PowerPC CPUs can operate in two modes: *big-endian* and *little-endian*.

* The **ppc** and **ppc64** stages are *big-endian* stages and can be used with *any PowerPC* CPU, including some old Apple™ hardware.
* The **ppc64le** stages are *little-endian* stages and are created for running on *POWER8 and newer* CPUs.
* The **power9le** stages are *little-endian* stages optimized exclusively for *POWER9* CPUs.

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

| [Description](#c0)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-14 19:26:26 UTC  ``` According to RedHat:   Reinhard Max discovered a buffer overflow flaw in the way Tk's GIF   processor handles an interlaced GIF with two frames.  It is possible   to overflow a buffer if the second frame is smaller than the first.   The fix can be found here: <http://tktoolkit.cvs.sourceforge.net/tktoolkit/tk/generic/tkImgGIF.c?r1=1.36&r2=1.37> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-14 19:33:32 UTC  ``` Whiteboard and cc'ing maintainers.  tcltk, please provide updated ebuilds with the patch applied.  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  MATSUU Takuto (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-16 02:29:07 UTC  ``` dev-lang/tk-8.4.15-r1 dev-lang/tk-8.5_alpha6-r1 in cvs. =dev-lang/tk-8.5* is masked so please mark stable tk-8.4.15-r1  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-16 04:11:26 UTC  ``` Thanks, Matsuu.

# Welcome to the Gentoo wiki!

Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!

## Available documentation

To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the [Documentation topic](#Documentation_topics) links provided below.

Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a *Handbook:* or *Project:* prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective *Discussion* pages.

Find something to add or edit? The [*Getting started*](#Getting_started) section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.

Most importantly, the **Gentoo Handbook** is among the best documents found on the wiki:

 [Gentoo Handbook (Official installation documentation)](/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page "Handbook:Main Page")

Due to usability issues the [visual editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVisualEditor "wikipedia:Wikipedia:VisualEditor") has been temporarily disabled. See [bug #910279](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910279) for more details.
#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# [VIM] clarification on multiple Tk overflow issues

Ubuntu just informed CVE of an older variant of CVE-2007-5137.

CVE-2007-5378 - 8.4.12 and earlier

CVE-2007-5137 - only affects 8.4.13 through 8.4.15; this was an
incorrect or incomplete patch for CVE-2007-5378.

These issues might look the same.  My read on it is: for 5378, the
second frame is LARGER than the first; for 5137, the second frame is
SMALLER than the first.

Note that another ID, CVE-2007-4851, was found to be a duplicate of
CVE-2007-5137, so don't use 4851.

Buffer overflow in the ReadImage function in generic/tkImgGIF.c in Tcl
(Tcl/Tk) 8.4.13 through 8.4.15 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via multi-frame interlaced GIF files in which later
frames are smaller than the first.  NOTE: this issue is due to an

Buffer overflow in the FileReadGIF function in tkImgGIF.c for Tk
Toolkit 8.4.12 and earlier, and 8.3.5 and earlier, allows
user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation
fault) via an animated GIF in which the first subimage is smaller than
a subsequent subimage, which triggers the overflow in the ReadImage
function, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-5137.

# Tk: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200710-07**

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in Tk.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/tk** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **8.4.15-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **8.4.15-r1** |

### Background

Tk is a toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces.

### Description

Reinhard Max discovered a boundary error in Tk when processing an
interlaced GIF with two frames where the second is smaller than the
first one.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted GIF
image with a Tk-based software, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Tk users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/tk-8.4.15-r1"
```
