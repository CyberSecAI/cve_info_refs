{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `/admin/upload_files.php` script does not verify if the user is an administrator, allowing unauthorized users to access the file upload functionality. Additionally, the script checks the MIME type of the uploaded file but not the extension, allowing for the upload of arbitrary files, such as PHP scripts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate access control: The `/admin/upload_files.php` script lacks proper authentication checks, allowing unauthorized users to upload files.",
      "Insufficient input validation: The script only checks MIME types but not file extensions, enabling the upload of malicious files with executable extensions."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/admin/upload_files.php` script with a malicious file as payload.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability, which can be triggered by any remote user."
