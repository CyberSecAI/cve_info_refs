```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
    - Blind SQL Injection in php-stats.recjs.php due to insufficient input validation of the 'ip' parameter, which is then used in a SQL query. Specifically, `long2ip()` does not sanitize inputs, and the use of `urldecode()` allows bypassing of `magic_quotes_gpc` protections.
    - Remote Code Execution in admin.php (and other files) because the `php-stats-options` value from the database is passed to `eval()`. If `$NowritableServer` is set to 1, this allows execution of arbitrary PHP code.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `ip` parameter in `php-stats.recjs.php`. This is due to the `long2ip()` function not sanitizing malicious input, allowing SQL injection through the `ip` parameter. The injected SQL can modify data in the database.
    - Remote Code Execution: The application allows remote code execution through the `eval()` function in `admin.php`, using the content of the `php-stats-options` from the database. This is enabled when `$NowritableServer` is set to 1, and by injecting malicious PHP code into this option.
    - Insecure use of `eval()`: The `eval()` function is used to execute code from the database, which allows for arbitrary code execution.

- Impact of exploitation:
    - SQL Injection: An attacker can retrieve sensitive data like admin password hashes through blind SQL injection. While the password hash is stored as sha1(sha1(pass)), cookie password for automatic login is stored as sha1(pass), so an attacker can perform a dictionary or bruteforce attack to obtain the plain text of the sha1 hash for the cookie.
    - Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting malicious PHP code into the `php-stats-options` record and triggering the `eval()` function. This allows for complete compromise of the system, such as creating a webshell.

- Attack vectors:
    - SQL Injection: The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a manipulated `ip` parameter that contains SQL injection payloads, targeting `php-stats.recjs.php`.
    - Remote Code Execution: An attacker with admin privileges can exploit this vulnerability by restoring a crafted database backup file with malicious PHP code in the `php-stats-options` field, and setting `$NowritableServer` to 1.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - For SQL Injection, the attacker needs to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable `php-stats.recjs.php` script.
    - For Remote Code Execution, the attacker needs to have administrator credentials to modify the `php-stats-options` and change the server write mode.
