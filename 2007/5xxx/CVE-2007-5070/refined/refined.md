Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `emprint.dll` component of EasyMail MessagePrinter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Heap Overflow:**  The `SetFont` method of the EasyMail MessagePrinter ActiveX control is vulnerable to a heap overflow. By providing an overly long string as the font name, the allocated buffer on the heap is overflowed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This is achieved by overwriting heap metadata, redirecting control flow to attacker-controlled shellcode.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote via Web Browser:** The exploit is triggered by an attacker-controlled web page. The vulnerable ActiveX control is instantiated via the `<object>` tag and the `SetFont` method is invoked using VBScript.
*  **User Interaction:**  The victim must visit the malicious web page using a vulnerable version of the software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote, Web-Based:** The attacker needs to host a malicious web page or inject the exploit into a website the victim visits.
*   **Limited User Interaction:** The victim only needs to visit the attacker-controlled website using a web browser (IE6 / XP SP2 in this case).

**Additional Details:**
* The exploit provided includes javascript code that appears to allocate a large amount of memory and fill it with shellcode.
* The provided VBScript code triggers the vulnerability by passing a very large string to the SetFont method.
* The exploit targets IE6 on Windows XP SP2
* The provided exploit aims to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
