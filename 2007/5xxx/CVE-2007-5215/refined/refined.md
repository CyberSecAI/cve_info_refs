{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses require_once with a variable ($SCRIPT_DIR) that can be manipulated to include remote files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include malicious files from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the $SCRIPT_DIR variable, an attacker can specify a URL to a malicious PHP file to be included.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the value of the $SCRIPT_DIR variable in the vulnerable files (gtk/main.inc.php and cmdline.inc.php)."
