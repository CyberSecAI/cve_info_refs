## Analysis of CVE-2007-5899

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5899:

**1. Verification of Content Relevance:**

The content from `www.debian.org`, `www.ubuntu.com`, and `bugs.php.net` directly mentions CVE-2007-5899. The other websites do not have content relevant to this CVE.
The CVE description in the debian mailing list advisory exactly matches the description in the ubuntu notice "It was discovered that the output_add_rewrite_var() function could leak session ID information, resulting in information disclosure."

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `output_add_rewrite_var()` function within PHP, which could leak session ID information when used in specific contexts.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Incorrect handling of the `output_add_rewrite_var()` function, leading to information disclosure. The `output_add_rewrite_var` function incorrectly added session id information even to forms targeting remote URLs. The session id should only be used locally.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain access to a user's session ID and subsequently to their login credentials, leading to unauthorized access to a PHP application.

*   **Attack Vectors:** A remote attacker could craft a malicious website containing a form that targets a vulnerable PHP application, exploiting the session ID leak in the `output_add_rewrite_var()` function.

*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into interacting with their malicious site. The attacker can use a client-side attack by making a user visit a malicious webpage.

**3. Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 1444-1) identifies the specific PHP versions affected (5.2.0-8+etch9 for the stable distribution). It also mentions that Debian's version of PHP is hardened with the Suhosin patch, which mitigates some vulnerabilities.
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-628-1) specifies the affected Ubuntu versions and the package versions that address the vulnerability. It also confirms that the vulnerability is specific to Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. It also provides a detailed explanation of the output\_add\_rewrite\_var function vulnerability: "It was discovered that the output\_add\_rewrite\_var function would sometimes leak session id information to forms targeting remote URLs. Malicious remote sites could use this information to gain access to a PHP application user's login credentials. This issue only affects Ubuntu 8.04 LTS."
*   The bug report from `bugs.php.net` shows that the issue was reported on 2007-10-05 and fixed by 2007-10-10. It describes that the session ID was leaked when an absolute URL was used in the action attribute of the form tag. It includes sample code, expected result and actual result which lead to the discovery of the vulnerability.

**4. Summary**

CVE-2007-5899 is a PHP vulnerability related to the `output_add_rewrite_var()` function, where the session ID could be leaked to forms targeting external websites. This vulnerability could allow attackers to obtain user session IDs and potentially gain unauthorized access to web applications. The vulnerability was fixed in updated versions of PHP.
