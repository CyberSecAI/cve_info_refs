      "details": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in Hitachi Web Server related to the verification of SSL client certificates. Although the CVE ID mentioned in the document is CVE-2006-4339, this is a mistake as the description matches CVE-2007-5810. The root cause is that the Hitachi Web Server might verify a forged signature in the certificate of an SSL client. This occurs when the server uses the Hitachi Web Server function for authenticating SSL clients. The vulnerability is present in versions of Hitachi Web Server and Cosminexus products that bundle Hitachi Web Server. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by using a forged certificate to bypass the client certificate authentication and gain unauthorized access to the system. The attack vector is through the SSL/TLS handshake process when the server authenticates a client via client certificate. The required attacker capability is the ability to craft a forged certificate. Impact is unauthorized access."
