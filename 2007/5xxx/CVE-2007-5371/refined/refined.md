- Root cause of vulnerability: Improper sanitization of user-supplied parameters ('documentDirty' and 'modVariables') before using them in an SQL query.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL injection vulnerability in the 'mutate_content.dynamic.php' script.
- Impact of exploitation: Allows for the execution of arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other unauthorized database operations.
- Attack vectors: Remote exploitation via HTTP requests using vulnerable parameters.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: No authentication is required, and the attacker can exploit remotely as long as magic_quotes_gpc is off.
