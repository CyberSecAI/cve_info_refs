How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

* **001: SECURITY FIX: October 8, 2007**
    *All architectures*

  Malicious DHCP clients could cause dhcpd(8) to corrupt its stack

  A DHCP client that claimed to require a maximum message size less than
  the minimum IP MTU could cause dhcpd(8) to overwrite stack memory.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.2/common/001_dhcpd.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: October 10, 2007**
      *All architectures*

    The SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers() function in OpenSSL contains an off-by-one overflow.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.2/common/002_openssl.patch)

    * **003: CD BOOT FAILURE ON OLDER COMPUTERS : October 30, 2007**
        *i386 only*

      Some older BIOSes are unable to boot CD1 (ie. the commercial release sold
      by the project, not the CD images available on the net).
      A workaround using CD2 (amd64 architecture) is as follows.
      (An amd64 machine is *NOT* required for this to work.)

      1. Insert CD2 and tell your computer to boot it;
         * When the `boot>` prompt appears, stop the automatic boot
           by pressing the space bar;
           * Remove CD2 and insert CD1;
             * Erase the character you typed to stop the boot, type

               `boot /4.2/i386/bsd.rd`

               then press *Enter*.

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: November 27, 2007**
          *All architectures*

        A memory leak in pf can lead to machine lockups.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.2/common/004_pf.patch)

        * **005: RELIABILITY FIX: January 11, 2008**
            *All architectures*

          A missing NULL pointer check can lead to a kernel panic.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.2/common/005_ifrtlabel.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: February 8, 2008**
              *All architectures*

                      *All architectures*

                    sshd(8) would execute ~/.ssh/rc even when a sshd\_config(5) *ForceCommand*
                    directive was in effect, allowing users with write access to this file to
                    execute arbitrary commands. This behaviour was documented, but was an unsafe
                    default and an extra hassle for administrators.

                          A vulnerability has been found with BIND. An attacker could use this vulnerability
                          to poison the cache of a recursive resolving name server.

                            Some kinds of IPv6 usage would leak kernel memory (in particular, this path
                            was exercised by the named(8) patch for port randomization). Since INET6 is
                            enabled by default, this condition affects all systems.

                              solicitation requests maybe allowing a nearby attacker to intercept traffic.
                              The attacker must have IPv6 connectivity to the same router as their target for
                              this vulnerability to be exploited.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

2007-10-03 21:42:32 UTC (RELENG\_5\_5, 5.5-RELEASE-p16)
CVE Name: CVE-2007-5135
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project. The OpenSSL Project is
a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured,
and Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.
II. Problem Description
A buffer overflow addressed in FreeBSD-SA-06:23.openssl has been found
to be incorrectly fixed.
III. Impact
For applications using the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers() function, the
buffer overflow could allow an attacker to crash or potentially
execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the
application.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but only applications using the
SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers() function are affected.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 5-STABLE, or 6-STABLE, or to the
RELENG\_6\_2, RELENG\_6\_1, or RELENG\_5\_5 security branch dated after the
correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patch have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 5.5, 6.1,
and 6.2 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-07:08/openssl.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-07:08/openssl.patch.asc
b) Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/secure/lib/libssl
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

* **001: SECURITY FIX: November 4, 2006**
    *All architectures*

  [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/httpd.8)
  does not sanitize the Expect header from an HTTP request when it is
  reflected back in an error message, which might allow cross-site scripting (XSS)
  style attacks.
  [CVE-2006-3918](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3918)

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/001_httpd.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: November 4, 2006**
      *All architectures*

    Several problems have been found in OpenSSL. While parsing certain invalid ASN.1
    structures an error condition is mishandled, possibly resulting in an infinite
    loop. A buffer overflow exists in the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers function. A NULL
    pointer may be dereferenced in the SSL version 2 client code. In addition, many
    applications using OpenSSL do not perform any validation of the lengths of
    public keys being used.
    [CVE-2006-2937](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2937),
    [CVE-2006-3738](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3738),
    [CVE-2006-4343](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4343),
    [CVE-2006-2940](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2940)

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/002_openssl.patch)

    * **003: SECURITY FIX: November 4, 2006**
        *All architectures*

      Fix for an integer overflow in
      [systrace(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/systrace.4)'s
      STRIOCREPLACE support, found by
      Chris Evans. This could be exploited for DoS, limited kmem reads or local
      privilege escalation.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/003_systrace.patch)

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: November 7, 2006**
          *All architectures*

        Due to a bug in the
        [arc(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/arc.4)
        RAID driver the driver will not properly synchronize the cache to the logical volumes
        upon system shut down. The result being that the mounted file systems within the logical
        volumes will not be properly marked as being clean and fsck will be run for the subsequent
        boot up.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/004_arc.patch)

        * **005: SECURITY FIX: November 19, 2006**
            *All architectures*

          The ELF
          [ld.so(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/ld.so.1)
          fails to properly sanitize the environment. There is a potential localhost security
          problem in cases we have not found yet. This patch applies to all ELF-based
          systems (m68k, m88k, and vax are a.out-based systems).

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/005_ldso.patch)

          * **006: FTP DISTRIBUTION ERROR: December 4, 2006**
              *All architectures*

            The **src.tar.gz** and **ports.tar.gz** archives
            released on FTP were created incorrectly, a week after the 4.0 release. The
            archives on the CD sets are correct; this only affects people who downloaded
            them from a [mirror](ftp.html).

            The archives have been corrected. The correct MD5 of
            [ports.tar.gz](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.0/ports.tar.gz) is eff352b4382a7fb7ffce1e8b37e9eb56, and for
            [src.tar.gz](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.0/src.tar.gz) it is b8d7a0dc6f3d27a5377a23d69c40688e.

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: January 3, 2007**
                *i386 only*

              Insufficient validation in
              [vga(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/vga.4)
              may allow an attacker to gain root privileges if the kernel is compiled with
              `option PCIAGP`
              and the actual device is not an AGP device.
              The `PCIAGP` option is present by default on i386
              kernels only.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/i386/007_agp.patch)

              * **008: RELIABILITY FIX: January 16, 2007**
                  *All architectures*

                Under some circumstances, processing an ICMP6 echo request would cause
                the kernel to enter an infinite loop.

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/008_icmp6.patch)

                * **009: INTEROPERABILITY FIX: February 4, 2007**
                    *All architectures*

                  A US daylight saving time rules change takes effect in 2007.

                  [A source code patch exists which syncs the timezone data files with tzdata2007a](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/009_timezone.patch).

                  * **010: SECURITY FIX: March 7, 2007**
                      *All architectures*

                    **2nd revision, March 17, 2007**

                    Incorrect mbuf handling for ICMP6 packets.

                    Using
                    [pf(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/pf.4)
                    to avoid the problem packets is an effective workaround until the patch
                    can be installed.

                    Use "block in inet6" in /etc/pf.conf

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/010_m_dup1.patch)

                    * **011: SECURITY FIX: April 4, 2007**
                        *All architectures*

                      Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in X.Org.

                      XC-MISC extension ProcXCMiscGetXIDList memory corruption vulnerability,
                      BDFFont parsing integer overflow vulnerability,
                      fonts.dir file parsing integer overflow vulnerability,
                      multiple integer overflows in the XGetPixel() and XInitImage functions
                      in ImUtil.c.
                      [CVE-2007-1003](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1003),
                      [CVE-2007-1351](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1351),
                      [CVE-2007-1352](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1352),
                      [CVE-2007-1667](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1667).

                      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/011_xorg.patch)

                      * **012: SECURITY FIX: April 23, 2007**
                          *All architectures*

                        IPv6 type 0 route headers can be used to mount a DoS attack against
                        hosts and networks. This is a design flaw in IPv6 and not a bug in
                        OpenBSD.

                        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/012_route6.patch)

                        * **013: STABILITY FIX: April 26, 2007**
                            *PowerPC*

                          An unhandled AltiVec assist exception can cause a kernel panic.

                          * **014: STABILITY FIX: May 9, 2007**
                              *All Architectures*

                            A malicious client can cause a division by zero.

                            * **015: SECURITY FIX: July 9, 2007**
                                *All Architectures*

                              Fix possible heap overflow in file(1), aka CVE-2007-1536.

                                  *All architectures*

                                Malicious DHCP clients could cause dhcpd(8) to corrupt its stack

                                A DHCP client that claimed to require a maximum message size less than
                                the minimum IP MTU could cause dhcpd(8) to overwrite stack memory.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

OpenSSL security update (RHSA-2007-0813)

Original Release Date: November 26, 2007

Last Revised: November 26, 2007

Number: ASA-2007-485

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

OpenSSL is an open source toolkit that implements the Secure Socket Layer
(SSL) versions 2 and 3 protocols, the Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1
protocol as well as a general use cryptography library.

A vulnerability has been discovered in the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers() function
which could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted list of ciphers causing
a buffer overrun. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2007-5135](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5135) to this issue.

Several side-channel attacks have been reported in SSL. A local attacker could
potentially exploit this vulnerability to obtain RSA private keys being used on
a system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2007-3108](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3108) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0813.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with OpenSSL installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Manager | CM 3.0 | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya EMMC | 1.017, 1.021 | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | 3.1 and earlier | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable versions of
OpenSSL, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Welcome to the Gentoo wiki!

Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!

## Available documentation

To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the [Documentation topic](#Documentation_topics) links provided below.

Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a *Handbook:* or *Project:* prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective *Discussion* pages.

Find something to add or edit? The [*Getting started*](#Getting_started) section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.

Most importantly, the **Gentoo Handbook** is among the best documents found on the wiki:

 [Gentoo Handbook (Official installation documentation)](/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page "Handbook:Main Page")

 **Important**
Due to usability issues the [visual editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVisualEditor "wikipedia:Wikipedia:VisualEditor") has been temporarily disabled. See [bug #910279](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910279) for more details.
#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-27 22:31:37 UTC  ``` CVE-2007-5135:   Off-by-one error in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers function in OpenSSL   0.9.7l and 0.9.8d might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary   code via a crafted packet that triggers a one-byte buffer underflow.  According to Moritz Jodeit this is related to an improper fix for CVE-2006-3738. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-27 22:35:45 UTC  ``` The patch to the OpenSSL_0_9_8-stable branch can be found here:   <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=16587>  base-system, please advise. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2007-09-30 01:20:27 UTC  ``` openssl-0.9.8e-r3 in the tree with the patch ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-30 01:33:01 UTC  ``` Thanks, vapier.

Are you interested?  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Markus Rothe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-30 06:26:58 UTC  ``` ppc64 stable ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Joe Peterson (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-30 07:08:52 UTC  ``` For BDS: yes, definitely!  I'm trying to build 0.9.8e-r3 on BSD now, and I'll keyword it when successful.  BTW, it looks like system includes (previously installed by openssl) are being referenced during the build:  gmake[2]: Entering directory `/var/tmp/portage/dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8e-r3/work/openssl-0.9.8e/crypto/mdc2' i686-gentoo-freebsd6.2-gcc -I.. -I../.. -I../../include -fPIC -DOPENSSL_PIC -DZLIB_SHARED -DZLIB -DOPENSSL_THREADS -pthread -D_THREAD_SAFE -D_REENTRANT -DDSO_DLFCN -DHAVE_DLFCN_H -DL_ENDIAN -DTERMIOS -Wall -DOPENSSL_BN_ASM_PART_WORDS -DOPENSSL_IA32_SSE2 -DSHA1_ASM -DMD5_ASM -DRMD160_ASM -DAES_ASM -O2 -mtune=i686 -pipe -Wa,--noexecstack   -c -o mdc2dgst.o mdc2dgst.c mdc2dgst.c:88: error: conflicting types for 'MDC2_Update' /usr/include/openssl/mdc2.h:87: error: previous declaration of 'MDC2_Update' was here  Note that it's using /usr/include/openssl/mdc2.h...  I'll look at this more tomorrow, but even if the compile works, it should not be relying on old installs or using includes from them (could lead to insidious issues). ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-30 09:52:54 UTC  ``` base-system, please have a look at [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=194039#c5). ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2007-09-30 09:59:11 UTC  ``` completely unrelated and nothing new  there is already a different open bug on the topic ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Markus Meier   gentoo-dev  2007-09-30 13:46:40 UTC  ``` x86 stable ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Tobias Scherbaum (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-30 18:59:23 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Joe Peterson (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-30 19:02:48 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 132255](attachment.cgi?id=132255 "openssl-0.9.8e-r3.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=132255&action=edit "openssl-0.9.8e-r3.ebuild"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=132255&action=diff "openssl-0.9.8e-r3.ebuild")] openssl-0.9.8e-r3.ebuild  This ebuild patch fixes the "find" command that uses the "-lname" option.  This is a GNU option not available in BSD.  With this patch, we will be able to keyword x86-fbsd, and it appears to work.  I am hesitant to modify r3, however, since two archs have stabled, and this has not been tested on these (although it should work).  They really should check it again with this patch.  I can check this in as r4 - please advise.  SpanKY, BTW, your patch from [bug #146316](show_bug.cgi?id=146316 "RESOLVED FIXED - dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8b uses installed headers to build") fixed the BSD compile problem.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- Acroread wrapper script minor /tmp race
Adobe Acrobat Reader 8.1.2 contained a /tmp race in its "acroread"
wrapper script in the SSL certificate handling. (CVE-2008-0883)
This problem is not triggered by just starting acrobat reader,
but only on certificate handling.
Furthermore Acrobat Reader contained several duplicated copies of
system libraries, which have been removed by this update to make sure
they are up-to-date security wise by using the system provided ones.
Also on x86-64 platforms, the Mozilla embedding detection did not
work and was fixed, so the Splashscreen and Help are again displayed.
Updates have been released on SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10,
SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
Updates for version 7 for Novell Linux Desktop 9 and SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server 9 are still pending.
- Asterisk security issues
A security update was released for the PBX Asterisk, fixing following
security issues:
CVE-2007-6430: Attackers could bypass host based authentication by
using a valid user name.
CVE-2007-6170: Attackers could inject SQL commands under certain
circumstances if 'cdr\_pgsql' was used.
Asterisk was updated on SUSE Linux 10.1 and openSUSE 10.2.
- cacti various vulnerabilities
The following vulnerabilities were fixed in cacti:
- CVE-2008-0783: multiple XSS vulnerabilities
- CVE-2008-0784: path disclosure
- CVE-2008-0785: multiple SQL injections
- CVE-2008-0786: HTTP response splitting on very old PHP instances
Cacti is included in SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 and
was fixed there.
- compat-openssl097g security fixes
This update of compat-openssl097g fixes a off-by-one buffer overflow
in function SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers(). This vulnerability potentially
allows remote code execution; depending on memory layout of the
process. (CVE-2007-5135)
We released updates for openssl already, but an update for the compat
0.9.7g openssl libraries was missing and is provided with this patch.
Released for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE Linux 10.1 and openSUSE
10.2, 10.3.
- icu regular expression problems
Certain regular expressions could crash the ICU library
(CVE-2007-4770, CVE-2007-4771).
Updated icu packages have been released for all distributions.
- libcdio buffer overflow
A security bug was fixed in libcdio. Long file names in ISO file
systems with Joliet extension could cause a buffer overflow in
libcdio (CVE-2007-6613).
libcdio fixes were released for all SUSE Linux products.
- wireshark/ethereal security problems
The network analyzer wireshark (formerly known as ethereal) was
updated to fix the following security bugs:
- CVE-2008-1070: The SCTP dissector could crash on reception of bad packets
- CVE-2008-1071: The SNMP dissector could crash on reception of bad packets
- CVE-2008-1072: The TFTP dissector could crash Wireshark (maybe
a bug in the Cairo library on specific platforms)
- Jakarta Tomcat security problems
Various security issues in Jakarta Tomcat have been fixed:
- CVE-2006-7196: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
example JSP applications
- CVE-2007-3382: Handling of cookies containing a ' character
- CVE-2007-3385: Handling of \" in cookies
- CVE-2007-5461: tomcat path traversal / information leak
- CVE-2007-1860: directory traversal
- CVE-2008-0128: tomcat https information disclosure
- CVE-2005-2090: tomcat HTTP Request Smuggling
Updates have been released for all distributions.
- perl-Tk GIF security problem

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

##### 3. Problem description:

I Service Console package security updates

#####

a. OpenPegasus PAM Authentication Buffer Overflow
Alexander Sotirov from VMware Security Research discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the OpenPegasus Management server.

This flaw could be exploited by a malicious remote user on the service console network to gain root access to the service console.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2007-5360 to this issue.

RPM Updated: pegasus-2.5-552927
VM Shutdown: No
Host Reboot: No

Note: ESX Server 3.5 and ESX Server 3i are not affected by this issue.

ESX Server 3.0.2

[kb.vmware.com/kb/1003176](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1003176)

ESX Server 2.5.x
Users should remove the OpenPegasus CIM Management rpm. This component is disabled by default, and VMware recommends that you do not use this component of ESX Server 2.x. If you want to use the CIM functionality, upgrade to ESX Server 3.0.1 or a later release.

Note: This vulnerability can be exploited remotely only if the attacker has access to the service console network.

Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the service console be isolated from the VM network. Please see [www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726](http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726) for more information on VMware security best practices.

#####

b. Updated Samba package
An issue where attackers on the service console management network can cause a stack-based buffer overflow in the reply\_netbios\_packet function of nmbd in Samba. On systems where Samba is being used as a WINS server, exploiting this vulnerability can allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted WINS Name Registration requests followed by a WINS Name Query request.

An issue where attackers on the service console management network can exploit a vulnerability that occurs when Samba is configured as a Primary or Backup Domain controller. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via crafted GETDC mailslot requests, related to handling of GETDC logon server requests.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CVE-2007-5398 and CVE-2007-4572 to these issues.

Note: By default Samba is not configured as a WINS server or a domain controller and ESX is not vulnerable unless the administrator has changed the default configuration.

This vulnerability can be exploited remotely only if the attacker has access to the service console network.

Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the service console be isolated from the VM network. Please see [www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726](http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726) for more information on VMware security best practices.

c. Updated util-linux package
The patch addresses an issue where the mount and umount utilities in util-linux call the setuid and setgid functions in the wrong order and do not check the return values, which could allow attackers to gain elevated privileges via helper application such as mount.nfs.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2007-5191 to this issue.

# OpenSSL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200710-06**

A buffer underflow vulnerability and an information disclosure
vulnerability have been discovered in OpenSSL.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.8e-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.8e-r3** |

### Background

OpenSSL is an implementation of the Secure Socket Layer and Transport
Layer Security protocols.

### Description

Moritz Jodeit reported an off-by-one error in the
SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers() function, resulting from an incomplete fix of
CVE-2006-3738. A flaw has also been reported in the
BN\_from\_montgomery() function in crypto/bn/bn\_mont.c when performing
Montgomery multiplication.

### Impact

A remote attacker sending a specially crafted packet to an application
relying on OpenSSL could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application. A local attacker could
perform a side channel attack to retrieve the RSA private keys.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8e-r3"
```

### Description

LTSP version 4.2, ships prebuilt copies of programs such as the Linux
Kernel, the X.org X11 server (GLSA 200705-06, GLSA 200710-16, GLSA
200801-09), libpng (GLSA 200705-24, GLSA 200711-08), Freetype (GLSA
200705-02, GLSA 200705-22) and OpenSSL (GLSA 200710-06, GLSA 200710-30)
which were subject to multiple security vulnerabilities since 2006.
Please note that the given list of vulnerabilities might not be
exhaustive.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly exploit vulnerabilities in the
aforementioned programs and execute arbitrary code, disclose sensitive
data or cause a Denial of Service within LTSP 4.2 clients.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

LTSP 4.2 is not maintained upstream in favor of version 5. Since
version 5 is not yet available in Gentoo, the package has been masked.
We recommend that users unmerge LTSP:

```
 # emerge --unmerge net-misc/ltsp
```

If you have a requirement for Linux Terminal Servers, please either set
up a terminal server by hand or use one of the distributions that
already migrated to LTSP 5. If you want to contribute to the
integration of LTSP 5 in Gentoo, or want to follow its development,
find details in bug 177580.

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
