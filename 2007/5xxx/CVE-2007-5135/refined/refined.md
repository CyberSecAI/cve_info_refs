Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2007-5135:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an off-by-one buffer overflow in the `SSL_get_shared_ciphers()` function within OpenSSL. This vulnerability is a result of an incomplete fix from a previous issue (CVE-2006-3738).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability is specifically a one-byte buffer underflow in the `SSL_get_shared_ciphers()` function. This can happen when processing a list of ciphers during an SSL/TLS handshake.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (Potentially):** A remote attacker, by sending a specially crafted packet, could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application using the vulnerable OpenSSL library. The extent of this depends on process memory layout.
*   **Application Crash:** In some instances, the buffer overflow can simply crash the application that uses the vulnerable function.
*  **Information Disclosure**: A local attacker could potentially use a side channel attack to retrieve RSA private keys used on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending crafted network packets, particularly during SSL/TLS handshakes, targeting applications that use the affected OpenSSL function.
*  **Local:** A local attacker could leverage a side channel attack to obtain RSA private keys.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** A remote attacker needs network access to target systems using the vulnerable OpenSSL versions.
*  **Local Access:** A local attacker must be able to access the system to perform side channel attacks.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is a result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-3738, indicating that the initial patch was not sufficient.
*   The vulnerability is present in older versions of OpenSSL (0.9.7l and 0.9.8d) as reported by one source.
*   Several sources mention that applications using `SSL_get_shared_ciphers()` are affected by the buffer overflow, and recommend restricting access to vulnerable servers until updates can be applied.
*   The fix involves patching the OpenSSL library and rebuilding it or using updated packages as made available by the various affected OS vendors.
*   Several vendors and projects were impacted by this vulnerability which include but are not limited to FreeBSD, OpenBSD, RedHat, Gentoo, Debian, VmWare, Avaya and SUSE.
