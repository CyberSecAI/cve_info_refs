How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Date: Thu, 04 Oct 2007 21:16:43 +0200
```
Package: guilt
Version: 0.27-1
Severity: critical
Tags: security

guilt makes extensive use of the '$$' shell variable for temporary
files in /tmp.  This is a serious security vulnerability; on multi-user
systems it allows an attacker to clobber files with something like the
following:

  for i in `seq 1 32768`; do
    ln -sf /etc/passwd /tmp/guilt.log.$i;
  done

(In this example, if root does e.g. 'guilt push', /etc/passwd will get
clobbered.)

Please use mktemp(1) to create temporary files.

For reference:

guilt-0.27$ grep '$$' *
guilt:                          $reject "$p" > /dev/null 2> /tmp/guilt.log.$$
guilt:                                  rm -f /tmp/guilt.log.$$ /tmp/guilt.msg.\
$$
guilt:          do_get_header "$p" > /tmp/guilt.msg.$$
guilt:          [ ! -s /tmp/guilt.msg.$$ ] && echo "patch $pname" > /tmp/guilt.\

guilt:  rm -f /tmp/guilt.msg.$$ /tmp/guilt.log.$$
guilt:          do_get_full_header "$p" > /tmp/guilt.diff.$$
guilt:                  ) >> /tmp/guilt.diff.$$
guilt:          git-diff $diffopts "$2" >> /tmp/guilt.diff.$$
guilt-header:   do_get_full_header "$GUILT_DIR/$branch/$patch" > /tmp/guilt.msg\

I have contacted Josef Sipek, the author, about the issue and he will
work on it for the next release.

I will close this bug when the next release hits Debian.

Thanks,

This patch breaks Guilt in several ways, I am in the process of fixing it
right now, and I'll push the commit out when I am done. Brandon can then
decide whether he wants to pick up the one patch and backport it on top of
0.27 or just do a 0.28-snapshot type package.

No apart from doing a new one. However it needs some time to
get the package out of incoming so I can fix this with a new
upload as soon as the patch is there.
Josef, what do I break exactly?
Sorry for breaking things anyway!

I applied it, and at least 3 commands didn't work; apparently you missed a
place or two where /tmp/guilt.XYZ.$$ was used, which cascaded into a bit of

No problem :)

This bug has been fixed by Nico in an NMU, but that NMU was not acknowledged.
However, upstream has fixed the issue in their upstream version 0.28, so I'm
closing the bug.
