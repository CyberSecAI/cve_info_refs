Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5984:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from two issues within AutoIndex versions 2.2.2 and earlier.
      1. Improper sanitization of the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable, leading to XSS.
      2. Unsanitized user input within the directory size calculation logic, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to sanitize user input, specifically the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable, before outputting it in the HTML. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript.
  - Denial of Service (DoS): The application's recursive directory size calculation logic does not validate user input and is vulnerable to a DoS when given specific input, leading to excessive CPU/memory usage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
    - XSS: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the victim's browser, which could lead to stealing cookies, session hijacking, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
   - DoS: An attacker can cause a denial of service by causing the application to crash due to excessive resource consumption.

**Attack Vectors:**
    - XSS: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the URL (specifically in the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`).
    - DoS: An attacker can send a specific directory path (specifically using `dir=%00` in the URL) that will trigger the recursive calculation logic to run into an error and cause excessive resource consumption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable AutoIndex instance.
    - No special privileges or local access is required to exploit either vulnerability.
    - The attacker only needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint URL and how to craft the payloads.

**Additional Details:**

* The content provides more detail than the standard CVE description, outlining both the XSS and DoS vulnerabilities and providing proof-of-concept URLs. It also includes information on when the vulnerabilities were fixed.
* The provided PoC for XSS is `http://<host>/AutoIndex/index.php/"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`.
* The provided PoC for DoS is `http://<host>/AutoIndex/index.php?dir=%00`.
* The fixes were released in versions 2.2.3 (XSS) and 2.2.4 (DoS).
