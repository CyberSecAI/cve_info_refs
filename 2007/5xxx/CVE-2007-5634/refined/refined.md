    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-5634",
      "source": "www.bugtrack.almico.com_bd07c59a_20250125_211451.html",
      "root_cause": "The Speedfan.sys driver exposes privileged IOCTLs (IOCTL_RDMSR 0x9C402438 and IOCTL_WRMSR 0x9C40243C) via the \"\\Device\\speedfan\" device. User-mode programs can use these IOCTLs to read or write arbitrary Model Specific Registers (MSRs). Additionally, the handler for IOCTL 0x9c402420 lacks proper buffer checking.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper access control to MSRs",
        "Missing buffer size check"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can achieve privilege escalation by writing to critical MSRs, such as MSR_LSTAR, allowing the execution of code within the Kernel context. Additionally, improper buffer handling in another IOCTL can cause the machine to crash, or theoretically, lead to arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": "User-mode programs can send specially crafted IOCTL requests to the Speedfan.sys device driver.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to execute code in user mode to interact with the device driver."
