{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly includes files based on user-controlled input via the 'selskin' parameter without proper sanitization, leading to both Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, potentially accessing sensitive information (LFI).  They can also include remote files, enabling them to execute arbitrary code on the server (RFI).",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET requests with a crafted 'selskin' parameter and potentially 'xposbox[L][]' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server and have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters."
