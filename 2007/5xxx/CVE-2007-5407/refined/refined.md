- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Joomla! component JContentSubscription version 1.5.8 is vulnerable to multiple remote file inclusion (RFI). This occurs because the `mosConfig_absolute_path` variable is not properly sanitized or validated when included in `require` or `require_once` statements. This allows an attacker to inject a URL pointing to a malicious file that will be executed by the PHP interpreter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system and data.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter via HTTP GET requests to multiple vulnerable PHP files within the component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! application and have access to a server hosting a malicious file they want to include.
