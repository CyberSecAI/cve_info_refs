Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability lies in a PHP script within phpMyConferences version 8.0.2 and earlier. The script uses the $_GET method to retrieve a filename and directory for file download.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- The script uses `$_GET['dir']` in `filesize()` and `readfile()` without sanitization or validation, allowing attackers to specify arbitrary files on the server.
- There's an unclosed bracket in the `header` function call on line 2 of the vulnerable code: `header("Content-disposition: attachment; filename=".$_GET('filname']);`, however, the main issue is the usage of the `$_GET['dir']` without sanitization.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to download any file from the server that the web server user has permission to read, leading to information disclosure. This includes sensitive application data, configuration files, or even potentially system files.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector is through a web request by crafting the URL that contains the 'dir' parameter, specifying the path to the file to be downloaded.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable script. No specific privileges are required beyond this, an unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
