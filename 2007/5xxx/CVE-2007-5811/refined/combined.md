I don't know how many sites are actually affected by this. Here's the
affected script as it appears in version 8.0.2:

   <?php
   header("Content-disposition: attachment; filename=".$_GET('filname']);
   header("Content-Type: application/force-download");
   header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary");
   header("Content-Length: ".filesize($_GET['dir']));
   header("Pragma: no-cache");
   header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate,
post-check=0, pre-check=0");
   header("Expires: 0");
   readfile($_GET['dir']);

   ?>

Notice the unclosed bracket in the second line above? php can't parse it.
