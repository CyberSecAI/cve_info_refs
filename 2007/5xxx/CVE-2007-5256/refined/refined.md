Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2007-5256:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The vulnerability stems from two stack-based buffer overflows caused by the unsafe use of `strcpy()` and `sprintf()` functions within the FSD (Flight Simulator Daemon) application.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Unsafe String Handling:** The use of `strcpy()` without bounds checking allows for writing past the end of a fixed-size buffer.
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:**  The application doesn't properly validate the size of the input data received through network commands.
    *   **Stack-based buffer:** The vulnerable buffers are allocated on the stack, making them easier to overwrite with arbitrary code.

*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Buffer overflow in `exechelp`:** Exploitable via the `HELP` command on port 3010. A long string sent with the `HELP` command overwrites a 100-byte buffer.
    *   **Buffer overflow in `execmulticast`:** Exploitable through various commands on port 6809, specifically the `sendmulticast` function. A long string sent as the destination for multicast messages overwrites a 100-byte buffer.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution on the target system. An attacker could gain control of the server.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overflowing the buffer can also lead to crashing the service or making the server unavailable.
    *   **Partial Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** As the attack may lead to code execution, the impact could compromise confidentiality, integrity and availability.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network-based:** The vulnerabilities are accessible via network connections.
    *   **Specific Ports:** Port 3010/3011 is used for the `exechelp` vulnerability and port 6809 is used for the `execmulticast` vulnerability.
    *   **Crafted Payloads:** Exploiting the buffer overflows requires sending specially crafted strings that exceed the buffer's capacity.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to connect to the vulnerable server over the network.
    *   **Knowledge of FSD Protocol:**  The `execmulticast` requires an understanding of the FSD protocol used on port 6809 and a valid login, although these can be obtained by connecting to port 3011.
    *   **Payload Generation:** An attacker must be capable of crafting a malicious payload that will be used to exploit the buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit described in one of the sources targets the `HELP` command vulnerability and provides a proof-of-concept perl exploit, that includes a reverse shell to 10.0.0.100 on port 4321.
*   The vulnerable applications identified are `FSD V2.052 d9` (original FSD) and `FSFDT V3.000 d9`.
*   The vendor/maintainers (MCDU) were not responsive to the vulnerability report.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a string larger than 100 bytes to the `topic` buffer using the HELP command on port 3010. Also, the vulnerability on port 6809 can be triggered by sending a crafted string to the `servdest` buffer via a command on the port.

This information provides a clear picture of the vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and potential impact, which are consistent with the CVE description.
