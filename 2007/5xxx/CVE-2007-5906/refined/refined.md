  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-5906",
      "description": "Xen allowed virtual guest system users to cause a denial of service (hypervisor crash) by using a debug register (DR7) to set certain breakpoints.",
      "root_cause": "The Xen hypervisor did not properly restrict the use of debug registers (specifically DR7) by guest virtual machines.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Improper restriction of operations within the defined bounds."
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious guest virtual machine could cause a denial of service (hypervisor crash), affecting the stability of the host system and potentially other virtual machines.",
      "attack_vectors": "A guest virtual machine could exploit this by manipulating the DR7 debug register to set breakpoints that trigger a hypervisor crash.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to have control over a guest virtual machine running on the vulnerable Xen hypervisor. No special privileges within the guest are explicitly mentioned, just the ability to set debug registers."
