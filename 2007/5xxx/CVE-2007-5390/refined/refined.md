{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the 'index.php' file. Specifically, the `pagina` GET parameter is directly used in an include statement without any validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server by manipulating the `pagina` parameter, potentially leading to complete compromise of the web server.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable 'index.php' script. This request includes the 'pagina' parameter, which is set to a malicious URL pointing to a remote file.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. They also need access to a server from where they can host a malicious PHP file."
