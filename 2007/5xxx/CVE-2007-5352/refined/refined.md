  "cve": "CVE-2007-5352",
  "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Windows Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) due to its improper handling of local procedure call (LPC) requests. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to run code with elevated privileges. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
