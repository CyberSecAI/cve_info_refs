**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

## Microsoft Windows LSASS privilege escalation vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#410025

Original Release Date: 2008-01-08 | Last Revised: 2008-01-08

---

### Overview

The Windows LSASS service contains privilege escalation vulnerability.

### Description

| The Windows Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) is a process that enforces the local security policy.  Per Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS08-002](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-002.mspx):*An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Windows Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) due to its improper handling of local procedure call (LPC) requests. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to run code with elevated privileges. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local, authenticated attacker may be able gain elevated privileges or execute programs in the context of a different user. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**  Microsoft has released an update to address this issue. See Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS08-002](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-002.mspx) for more information. |
