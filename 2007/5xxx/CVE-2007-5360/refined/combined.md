How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=426568#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2007-12-22 08:32:49 UTC  ``` VMWare reported a buffer overflow vulnerability in the PAM authentication code in the OpenPegasus CIM management server. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely and results in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the cimserver process.  Details in next comment.  Due to the nature of the bug, and the Red Hat changes to tog-pegasus package, it's quite likely it has a much reduced impact, this will have to be investigated.  Current embargo is Dec 27th.  I've asked for an extension to Jan 3rd at the earliest.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=426568#c2)  Mark J. Cox    2007-12-22 08:35:04 UTC  ``` There were some changes made to authentication code for Red Hat version, these need to be checked  The sprintf is unfortunately not caught by fortify_source (because it's C++)  We do ship with a SELinux policy by default (it was a requirement of shipping this package)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=426568#c3)  Mark J. Cox    2007-12-22 12:37:54 UTC  ``` Not vulnerable.  The RHEL4 and RHEL5 builds of tog-pegasus do not build with PEGASUS_USE_PAM_STANDALONE_PROC and therefore do not compile the vulnerable function.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=426568#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-08 07:41:14 UTC  ``` Public now:  <http://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&m=119975801904357&w=4>    ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=426568#c7)  Mark J. Cox    2008-01-08 08:44:35 UTC  ``` Whilst this issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux tog-pegasus packages, we found a similar issue that does.  Please see [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=426578](show_bug.cgi?id=426578 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-0003 tog-pegasus pam authentication buffer overflow")   ``` |  |

# [VIM] vuldb confusion between OpenPegasus issues

It seems that some vulndbs have got a bit confused by the OpenPegasus
issues that were reported a couple of weeks ago.  That misinformation is
working it's way up into public reports.  So, for the record:

In December 2007, VMWare contacted the vendor-sec mailing list to let us
know they'd found a pre-authentication buffer overflow in OpenPegasus
versions prior to 2.7.  This issue was credited as being discovered by
Alexander Sotirov of VMware and allocated CVE-2007-5360.

This overflow only affected OpenPegasus builds that had been compiled to
use PAM and with the (optional) PEGASUS_USE_PAM_STANDALONE_PROC define.
This issue affected the VMWare OpenPegasus builds, but not the Red Hat
OpenPegasus builds.

<http://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&m=119975801904357&w=2>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2007-5360>

However, whilst investigating this issue, the Red Hat Security Response
Team discovered that there was a similar pre-authentication buffer
overflow affecting OpenPegasus versions prior to 2.7, but this time it
affected servers that had been compiled with PAM but without the
PEGASUS_USE_PAM_STANDALONE_PROC define, and was in a different piece of
code to the CVE-2007-5360 flaw.  This issue did affect the Red Hat
OpenPegasus builds.  We allocated CVE-2008-0003 to this issue.

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0002.html>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2008-0003>

Both of the issues were corrected upstream by a single patch, attached to
OpenPegasus bug 7220, the patch was written by Roger Kumpf.  Versions 2.7
were already not vulnerable as both bits of affected code had been
refactored for that release.
<http://cvs.opengroup.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=7220>

Thanks, Mark

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated tog-pegasus packages that fix a security issue are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The tog-pegasus packages provide OpenPegasus Web-Based Enterprise
Management (WBEM) services. WBEM is a platform and resource independent
DMTF standard that defines a common information model, and communication
protocol for monitoring and controlling resources.

During a security audit, a stack buffer overflow flaw was found in the PAM
authentication code in the OpenPegasus CIM management server. An
unauthenticated remote user could trigger this flaw and potentially execute
arbitrary code with root privileges. (CVE-2008-0003)

Note that the tog-pegasus packages are not installed by default on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux. The Red Hat Security Response Team believes that it would
be hard to remotely exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code, due to
the default SELinux targeted policy on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5,
and the SELinux memory protection tests enabled by default on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5.

Users of tog-pegasus should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing the
updated packages the tog-pegasus service should be restarted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use

##### 3. Problem description:

I Service Console package security updates

#####

a. OpenPegasus PAM Authentication Buffer Overflow
Alexander Sotirov from VMware Security Research discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the OpenPegasus Management server.

This flaw could be exploited by a malicious remote user on the service console network to gain root access to the service console.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2007-5360 to this issue.

RPM Updated: pegasus-2.5-552927
VM Shutdown: No
Host Reboot: No

Note: ESX Server 3.5 and ESX Server 3i are not affected by this issue.

ESX Server 3.0.2
[download3.vmware.com/software/vi/ESX-1002970.tgz](http://download3.vmware.com/software/vi/ESX-1002970.tgz)

[kb.vmware.com/kb/1003176](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1003176)

ESX Server 2.5.x
Users should remove the OpenPegasus CIM Management rpm. This component is disabled by default, and VMware recommends that you do not use this component of ESX Server 2.x. If you want to use the CIM functionality, upgrade to ESX Server 3.0.1 or a later release.

Note: This vulnerability can be exploited remotely only if the attacker has access to the service console network.

Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the service console be isolated from the VM network. Please see [www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726](http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726) for more information on VMware security best practices.

#####

b. Updated Samba package
An issue where attackers on the service console management network can cause a stack-based buffer overflow in the reply\_netbios\_packet function of nmbd in Samba. On systems where Samba is being used as a WINS server, exploiting this vulnerability can allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted WINS Name Registration requests followed by a WINS Name Query request.

An issue where attackers on the service console management network can exploit a vulnerability that occurs when Samba is configured as a Primary or Backup Domain controller. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via crafted GETDC mailslot requests, related to handling of GETDC logon server requests.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CVE-2007-5398 and CVE-2007-4572 to these issues.

Note: By default Samba is not configured as a WINS server or a domain controller and ESX is not vulnerable unless the administrator has changed the default configuration.

This vulnerability can be exploited remotely only if the attacker has access to the service console network.

Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the service console be isolated from the VM network. Please see [www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726](http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726) for more information on VMware security best practices.

c. Updated util-linux package
The patch addresses an issue where the mount and umount utilities in util-linux call the setuid and setgid functions in the wrong order and do not check the return values, which could allow attackers to gain elevated privileges via helper application such as mount.nfs.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2007-5191 to this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
