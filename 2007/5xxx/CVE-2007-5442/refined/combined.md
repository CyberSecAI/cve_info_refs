Hi,
There are several security bugs in CMS Made Simple 1.1.3.1 :
(I am not going to release dangerous and exploitable info here)
1) There is a highly dangerous PHP code execution bug in the script .
2) A registered user can access unauthorized pages . For example he can
upload files to the server, or can make users by posting data to
/admin/adduser.php directly ; Also he can access to admin logs
page (/admin/adminlog.php?page=1) .
3) There are 2 XSS bugs in the script .
4) There are 13 full path disclosure bugs . Direct access to several files
can expose full installation path .
The new version (1.1.4.1) has been released :
http://blog.cmsmadesimple.org/2007/10/07/announcing-cms-made-simple-1141
