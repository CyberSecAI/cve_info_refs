```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The 'help.php' script in ZZ FlashChat 3.1 is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI).
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input passed to the 'file' parameter in 'help.php'. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially exposing application source code, database credentials, configuration files, or other confidential information.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP request to the 'help.php' script, providing a path to a file on the server as the value for the 'file' parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
