Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-5337:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of `smb://` and `sftp://` URI schemes in Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey (and related products like Iceape/Iceweasel) when used on Linux systems with gnome-vfs support.  These URI schemes, when processed by the gnome-vfs library, can allow a web page to access local files on the user's system, if the user has configured SSH keys for passwordless access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure URI Handling:** The core weakness is that the browser allows a web page, loaded from a potentially untrusted source, to trigger the gnome-vfs library and access local files using `smb://` and `sftp://` URIs.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The browser does not sufficiently control or restrict the scope of file access when using these URI schemes through gnome-vfs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Stealing:** A remote attacker can potentially read any file owned by the victim from known locations on the server. For example, the attacker could read sensitive files such as the user's `.bash_history` file or SSH private keys if the user has configured passwordless SSH access.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive local files, leading to information disclosure.
*  **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, an attacker might potentially escalate privileges by obtaining sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** The primary attack vector involves luring a victim into loading a malicious web page. This page could be hosted on a compromised website, or even stored on the user's local machine via an accessible location, like /tmp or a shared folder, and then be opened in the browser..
*   **URI schemes:** Usage of  `smb://` and `sftp://` URI schemes which are not properly handled by the browser's protocol handlers.
*   **Gnome-VFS Dependency:**  The vulnerability is dependent on the system having gnome-vfs support, as this library is responsible for handling the insecure URI schemes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote or Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to make the victim load the malicious page (either remotely by hosting it on a website, or locally by placing it in an accessible path)
*   **Knowledge of System Paths:** The attacker needs some knowledge of potentially useful file paths on the target's system.
*  **Target System Prerequisites**: The vulnerability is present on systems with gnome-vfs support.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
*   The issue was reported by Georgi Guninski and was present in Firefox and Seamonkey.
*   The vulnerability was identified to be related to gnome-vfs and how it handles sftp and smb URIs.
*   The fix involves restricting access to these URI schemes for untrusted web content by disallowing unprivileged content from linking to these schemes, providing branch parity with trunk.
*   The issue exists in versions prior to Firefox 2.0.0.8 and SeaMonkey 1.1.6.
