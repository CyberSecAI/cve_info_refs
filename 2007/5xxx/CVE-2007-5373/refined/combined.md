How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

<http://www.debian.org/security/>                          Thijs Kinkhorst
March 15, 2008                        <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : ldapscripts
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-5373
Debian Bug     : 445582

Don Armstrong discovered that ldapscripts, a suite of tools to manipulate
user accounts in LDAP, sends the password as a command line argument when
calling LDAP programs, which may allow a local attacker to read this password
from the process listing.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1.4-2etch1.

The old stable distribution (sarge) does not contain an ldapscripts package.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
1.7.1-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ldapscripts package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

  The issue may appear in other places in your code (there is e.g. some
unsafe seds calls). Though I must say I don't really know how to fix
this minimally.

 Hi,

my non-debian man page says:
-y passwdfile
Use complete contents of passwdfile as the password for simple
authentication.

That and a temporary file with correct permissions should do the job here?
Haven't looked at the unsafe seds calls, though.

Kind regards,
Stefan

 Oops, disregard my previous message. Seems like I was a bit trigger happy
and mixed it up with the -T parameter?

-T newPasswdFile
Set the new password to the contents of newPasswdFile.

I managed to confuse myself right
now and I'm not even sure if any of these params are OK at all. So better
don't listen to me, sorry.

  for the ldappasswd yes it can work this way (mkstemp will give the
proper file, with the proper perms). FOr the sed calls it's less easy.

  I've not the time to fix that right now though.

  The issue is that when the commands are run, the arguments can be seen
in clear text in `ps aux` output.

  So not only that script has the issue, the parts where you sed -e
"s/<password>/$PASSWORD/g" are vulnerable too.

  I understand the issue is not that obvious to fix, but this is an
issue in a multiuser environment, even if small (in my company we use
ldap, we don't want our interns to run busy psaux loops to steal the
ldap password …).

Hi again Pierre,

Yes, this is a really *big* issue. This is why one should prevent users to see
processes running with another uid and/or gid (e.g.
security.bsd.see_other_[u|g]ids sysctls on FreeBSD and hardened kernels on
GNU/Linux) !

Unfortunalety, this is not always possible and there is no simple way to fix
this flaw. Note this is not related to the ldapscripts : any admin running a
'standard' ldapadd command (or ldapmodify, ...) with the -w switch will
encounter the same problem.

I'll try to have a look at it. The idea of a file containing the passwd could be
good... Any other idea is welcome :)

Best regards,

  IMHO the best fix is to have in your "runtime" file sth like:

$SAFE_TMPDIR=`mktemp -d` || die "unable to create safe temporary directory"
trap "rm -rf $SAFE_TMPDIR" 0

  This way, when any script ends, all the temporary safe directory gets
removed.

  Then you can create whichever file you want, even using predefined
filenames if you want to. sed and ldappasswd are both able to read their
commands in a file. Also one could argue that "echo $PASSWD" is safe in
many shells where echo is a builtin.

You could ensure that it's the case using:

if ! (type echo || die "shell has no 'type' builtin") | grep -q builtin; then
    die "echo is not a builtin, ldapscripts won't be safe"
fi

  I tried in bash, dash, posh and zsh. it detects properly that posh
isn't suitable.

So that you can build the sed scripts using:
  echo "$PASSWORD" >> foo.sed
in a safe way.

Hi again Pierre,

I am still working on patching the scripts. This will lead to a 'security
release' named 1.7.1, quite soon (I hope).

Binding is Ok, I will use a file containing the password (no more $BINDPWD
variable) and ldap commands' -y option. Anyway, I still think this 'flaw' should
also be patched at openldap level when possible (setproctitle(3)).

I still wonder if it is a good idea to use a temporary file for sed scripts.
Trap is good, but what if the server crashes ? Is it better to be able to watch
sed expressions during a few seconds with ps or to leave orphan temporary files
on the disk forever ? Any idea ?

  If the server crash, then it will be rebooted, and /tmp is cleansed at
boot time, so no worries here.

Well, it depends on your system and how it is configured... But I agree, such a
situation (crash /while/ using the script + /tmp not cleansed) may happen quite
rarely.

Hi everybody,

ldapscripts v1.7.1 are now available and fix these issues.

Here is the CHANGELOG :

------------
2007/10/13 : ldapscripts 1.7.1
  - Fixes for [CVE-2007-5373](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5373)
    see <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5373>
    and <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=445582>

    1) Up to now, each ldap* command was called with the -w parameter, which
allows to
      specify the bind password on the command line. Unfortunately, this could
make the
      password appear to anybody performing a `ps` during the call. This is now
avoided
      by using the -y parameter and a password file.

      -> A new BINDPWDFILE option has been added : it specifies the path to the bind
      password file. This file can be created by something like :
      'echo -n 'password' > $BINDPWDFILE' and you can now safely remove (or
comment) the
      BINDPWD parameter from your configuration file.

    2) Changing a user password could also reveal the new password on the
command line,
      because of the use of ldappasswd's -s option. This has been fixed by using
a temporary
      file containing the new password (and ldappassword's -T option).

      -> [internals] New mktempf() and reltempf() functions have been added

    [For older versions of OpenLDAP, -y and -T parameters may not be available.
It is still
    possible to use the old BINDPWD parameter. Just uncomment it from the
configuration file
    and comment the BINDPWDFILE parameter (which takes precedence over BINDPWD). The
    ldapscripts will just behave as previously and use inline -w and -s
parameters, warning
    you this is not secure way of running them.]

    3) A similar problem related to sed expressions has been found : it may also
lead to
      reveal a user's password to `ps` users. This is now fixed by using
temporary files
      containing sed expressions (and sed's -f option).

    4) A new test has been added to check if 'echo' and '[' are built-in or not.
If not,
      you'll be warned that the ldapscripts may not be safe to use (because
these commands
      manipulate passwords when creating temporary files).

      -> [internals] New is_builtin() function

    Note that these flaws depend largely on your kernel configuration : hardened
kernels
    should not be impacted (e.g. if you use security.bsd.see_other_[u|g]ids
sysctls on
    FreeBSD). It may also depend on the version of OpenLDAP client commands you run.

    Thanks a lot to Don and Madcoder for their help !

  - Few fixes to avoid using non-standard 'if ! command's...
------------

Thanks a lot for your help in finding these issues ! (and don't hesitate to come
back to me again if you find other problems related to the scripts)

Hi

Today, I had a look at the new upstream version 1.7.1, in order to fix
unstable and testing. Thew new upstream version uses a function called
mktempf () . There you generate the tempfile. However, you do not use
the "mktemp" program. I did not try it so far, but I think that it is
possible to guess the temp file, because you use
_TMPFILE="$TMPDIR/`basename $0`.`date '+%Y%m%d-%H%M%S'`.$$"

I would suggest using mktemp instead, which creates unique temporary
filenames, which cannot be guessed.

Cheers
Steffen

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
