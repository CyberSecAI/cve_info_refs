Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-5373:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `ldapscripts` suite of tools passing passwords as command-line arguments to LDAP programs. Specifically, when calling `ldappasswd`, the password was included directly in the command. Additionally, `sed` commands used for processing LDAP data were also vulnerable by including passwords directly within the command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Passwords were exposed as command-line arguments. This is a vulnerability because any user on the system could potentially view these arguments using tools like `ps aux`, especially if the kernel is not hardened to restrict visibility of other user's process information.
*   **Insecure use of `sed`:**  `sed` commands were also vulnerable to password exposure by directly including the password in the command

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A local attacker could potentially gain access to LDAP bind passwords and user passwords. This could allow the attacker to compromise the LDAP directory and potentially gain control over other services reliant on the LDAP directory for authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the system running `ldapscripts` can view the process listing, including command-line arguments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the system where `ldapscripts` are executed.
*   **Ability to View Process List:** The attacker must have the ability to view the process list (typically using commands like `ps aux` or similar). This usually requires no special privileges on most systems but can be restricted on hardened systems.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability was present in `ldapscripts` versions 1.4 and 1.7.
*   The fix involved modifying the scripts to use password files instead of command line arguments, leveraging the `-y` parameter for `ldap` commands and `-T` for `ldappasswd`, as well as using temporary files for `sed` expressions with the `-f` option.
*   The fix also includes checks to ensure that the `echo` and `[` commands are built-in commands to mitigate temporary file creation issues.
*   The temporary files are created within a directory created using `mktemp` and cleaned up using `trap`, to prevent orphaned temporary files if the script exists without completing normally, for example, in case of a server crash.
*   The Debian security advisory DSA-1517-1 and DTSA-68-1 covers the fix for this vulnerability and notes that it's a local information disclosure vulnerability
