#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Windows hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer will apply the LDR version of this update. Otherwise, the installer will apply the GDR version of the update. The LDR version of a file has a higher version number than the GDR version of a file. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994). For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 934307](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/934307).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?, /h, /help** | Displays help on supported switches. |
| **/quiet** | Suppresses the display of status or error messages. |
| **/norestart** | When combined with /quiet, the system will not be restarted after installation even if a restart is required to complete installation. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951). For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Removing the Update**

To remove this update, click **Control Panel**, click **Security**, then under **Windows Update**, click **View installed updates** and select from the list of updates.â

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **General** tab, determine the modified date of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the modified date that is documented in the appropriate file information table. The files in this package do not have version numbers.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a recommended method of verifying that the update has been applied. However the files updated for this security patch do not contain file version information so using file attributes information used to verify the update is a detection mechanisms. In certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

## Microsoft Windows Vista privilege escalation vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#601073

Original Release Date: 2007-12-11 | Last Revised: 2007-12-11

---

### Overview

Microsoft Windows Vista contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability.

### Description

| The Windows Advanced Local Procedure Call (ALPC) does not properly evaluate certain conditions in legacy reply paths.  Per Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-066](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-066.mspx):*An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows kernel processes certain access requests. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to run code and to take complete control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.*Note that this vulnerability is present in the 32 and 64-bit versions of Windows Vista. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local attacker may be able to gain elevated privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**Microsoft has released an update to address this issue. Administrators and users should see Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-066](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-066.mspx) for information about obtaining fixed software. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
