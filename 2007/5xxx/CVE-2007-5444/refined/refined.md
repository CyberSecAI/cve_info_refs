*   **Full Path Disclosure:** 13 full path disclosure vulnerabilities exist. Direct access to certain files reveals the full installation path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **PHP Code Execution:** Allows for arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Enables malicious users to gain administrative control, upload malicious files, and add unauthorized users to the system.
*   **XSS:** Allows attackers to inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages, leading to data theft, session hijacking, and other malicious activities.
*  **Full Path Disclosure:** Reveals the server's internal file structure, which can help attackers in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **PHP Code Execution:** Exploitation likely involves crafting a malicious request that exploits the vulnerable PHP code.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Directly accessing administrative pages with a registered user account.
*   **XSS:** Injecting malicious scripts through user-supplied data or URL parameters.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** Direct requests to specific files that expose the full path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
