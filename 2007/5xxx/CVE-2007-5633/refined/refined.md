  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2007-5633",
      "source": "www.bugtrack.almico.com_bd07c59a_20250125_134054.html",
      "root_cause": "The Speedfan.sys driver exposes an interface via \"\\Device\\speedfan\" allowing user-mode programs to issue privileged IOCTLs to read and write arbitrary Model Specific Registers (MSRs).",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of proper access control on MSR read/write operations.",
        "Insufficient buffer checking in handler for IOCTL 0x9c402420"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can use IOCTLs 0x9C402438 (read MSR) and 0x9C40243C (write MSR) to read or write arbitrary MSRs, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in kernel context (e.g. by hijacking MSR_LSTAR). The improper buffer checking in the handler for IOCTL 0x9c402420 can cause a system crash, and theoretically could also lead to arbitrary code execution although considered unlikely.",
      "attack_vectors": "User-mode programs can send specially crafted IOCTL requests to the Speedfan.sys driver via the \"\\Device\\speedfan\" device interface.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code in user mode on the target machine and have the ability to interact with the Speedfan.sys driver through its device interface."
