| Summary | 0000987: Speedfan.sys IOCTL Dispatch Handlers privilege escalation | | | | |
| Description | Speedfan.sys is exposed via "\Device\speedfan".  User-mode programs can issue privileged IOCTLs (IOCTL\_RDMSR 0x9C402438 && IOCTL\_WRMSR 0x9C40243C) to the driver in order to read or write arbitrary MSRs. For instance, hijacking the MSR\_LSTAR an attacker can execute code within the Kernel context.   There is another flaw within the handler for the IOCTL 0x9c402420 which can cause the machine to crash (theorically it might be possible to execute arbitrary code as well, but is very unlikely) because of improper buffer checking.  There is a proof-of-concept available at <http://kartoffel.reversemode.com/downloads.php> | | | | |

|  | |
| [ruben](http://www.bugtrack.almico.com/view_user_page.php?id=1672)  2007-10-01 15:08  reporter    [~0003008](view.php?id=987#c3008 "Direct link to note") | Restrict the MSRs a user can read/write would be the basic fix. I guess that you are implementing this feature in order to access some thermal information so the driver should block those MSRs that are not related with that field.  PatchGuard verifies certain Kernel structures/areas every 5/10 minutes, on the other hand an attacker just need few miliseconds to exploit this issue. |

This will force me to update the driver more often than I want, but I prefer security. I'm going to fix it this evening. Then I will have to remember how to sign the driver :-) |

Is there any security issue, in your opinion, in reading an arbitrary MSR? |
|  | |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
