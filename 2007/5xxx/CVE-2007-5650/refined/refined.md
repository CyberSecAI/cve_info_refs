Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5650:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper filtering of the `module` parameter in the `system.php` file of ReloadCMS version 1.2.7. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `GET['module']` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The primary weakness is a path traversal vulnerability. The lack of proper filtering on the `module` parameter allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially read sensitive files on the server, like `/etc/passwd` as shown in the proof-of-concept.
- **Partial Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a partial impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The ability to read arbitrary files could lead to further exploitation and system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be carried out remotely via HTTP requests by manipulating the `module` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable ReloadCMS application.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in `system.php` where the `GET['module']` parameter is used without proper sanitization.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) URL is provided: `http://site.url/index.php?module=../../../../etc/passwd` which demonstrates how an attacker can read the content of `/etc/passwd`.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" in severity.
- The software affected is ReloadCMS version 1.2.7.
- No patch was available at the time of discovery.
- The vulnerability was discovered by sekuru.
