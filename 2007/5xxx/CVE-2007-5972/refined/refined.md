    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2007-5972",
    "summary": "A double free vulnerability exists in the krb5_def_store_mkey function within the kdb library of MIT Kerberos 5. This vulnerability can lead to a crash of the service." ,
    "details": "The vulnerability is a double-free condition in the `krb5_def_store_mkey` function located in `lib/kdb/kdb_default.c`. Specifically, if the `fwrite` operation fails, the file pointer `kf` is closed, and then the same pointer is again closed which leads to a double free/close. While the vulnerability is present and technically exploitable, exploiting it requires triggering a failure during the `fwrite` operation and this code is only run when the KDC database is created, under the control of an administrator, who would already have the level of privilege afforded by exploiting this flaw. The vulnerability can be triggered by a remote attacker who can manipulate an application that uses kdb library functions.",

          "CWE-415: Double Free",
	  "CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime"

      "impact": "A remote attacker could cause the KDC or kadmind service to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker can send specially crafted traffic to trigger the vulnerability through applications that use the kdb library functions. Vulnerability can also be triggered by malicious admin action, as this code is run during initial KDC database creation."
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to manipulate an application using the kdb library and cause a failure in the fwrite operation to trigger a double free. This can be achieved through network access or malicious administrative actions. Unauthenticated remote attacker could cause KDC/kadmind services to crash."
