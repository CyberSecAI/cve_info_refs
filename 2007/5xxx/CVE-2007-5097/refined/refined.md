- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the usage of `require_once` with a file path constructed using `$DOC_ROOT` variable, which could potentially be manipulated or not sanitized correctly, leading to inclusion of arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The script uses a potentially unsafe variable `$DOC_ROOT` to construct the file path for inclusion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the `$DOC_ROOT` variable (if possible), an attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the value of `$DOC_ROOT` in order to inject a malicious URL.
