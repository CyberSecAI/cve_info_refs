Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-5112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the login page of Google Urchin Web Analytics 5.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The login page of Google Urchin Web Analytics 5 is vulnerable to XSS.
- The vulnerability exists because user-supplied data is not properly sanitized or encoded before being displayed on the page, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Theft:** Attackers can steal usernames and passwords by injecting malicious JavaScript that modifies the login form's action attribute or by stealing autocomplete data.
- **Phishing:** Attackers can perform more advanced XSS phishing attacks, making them harder to detect. This includes redirecting information to third-party sites.
- **Background credential theft:** The injected JavaScript can send credentials to a remote site without the user's immediate awareness by using techniques like dynamically creating an image to transmit data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious URL that includes the injected JavaScript is crafted and sent to the victim, often through social engineering (e.g., via a link).
- The victim only needs to click on the malicious link for the attack to be executed.
- Exploitation requires the victim to have the "autocomplete passwords" feature enabled in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with injected JavaScript.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking on the malicious link.
- The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was tested on Urchin versions 5.6.00r2, 5.7.01, 5.7.02 and 5.7.03.
- It is likely that earlier versions are also affected.
- The provided proof of concept URL looks like: `http://target/session.cgi?"><script>alert('XSS')</script><!--`
- The vulnerability does not work on IE7 but might work on IE6 due to how autocomplete works in those browsers.
- The attacker can create a stealth attack by using javascript to steal the credentials in the background.
