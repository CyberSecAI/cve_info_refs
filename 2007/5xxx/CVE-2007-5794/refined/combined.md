Hi All,

    We recently upgraded from UW (boy, starting to sound like a broken
record, eh?)...

    Two problems:

    1. Every two or three days users are unable to access their email
via IMAP. It seems that it's because dovecot-auth has hung. Has anyone
seen anything like this?

    2. (the really serious one)... one of our users, "angie" has twice
had her Outlook download other users' email! Once as another user,
"helene", and just now as "mkarlin". The first time she got 800 of
helene's email, and just now, about 30 of mkarlin's.... from our log, I
noticed:

Mar  2 17:27:10 core imap-login: Login: mkarlin [::ffff:128.195.131.2]
Mar  2 17:27:10 core imap-login: Login: mkarlin [::ffff:128.195.131.2]
Mar  2 17:27:11 core pop3-login: Login: angie [::ffff:68.231.223.128]
Mar  2 17:27:11 core imap-login: Login: mkarlin [::ffff:128.195.131.2]
Mar  2 17:27:11 core imap-login: Login: mkarlin [::ffff:128.195.131.2]

Our server setup:

Fedora Core 3. dovecot-0.99.13. OpenLDAP, and dovecot auth'ing off PAM
(mostly default setup, using Mailbox, and mail/ as a subdir).

Any ideas? Any more debug info I can supply?

# nss\_ldap: Information disclosure — GLSA **200711-33**

A race condition might lead to theft of user credentials or information
disclosure in services using nss\_ldap.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-auth/nss\_ldap** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **258** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **258** |

### Background

nss\_ldap is a Name Service Switch module which allows 'passwd', 'group'
and 'host' database information to be pulled from LDAP.

### Description

Josh Burley reported that nss\_ldap does not properly handle the LDAP
connections due to a race condition that can be triggered by
multi-threaded applications using nss\_ldap, which might lead to
requested data being returned to a wrong process.

### Impact

Remote attackers could exploit this race condition by sending queries
to a vulnerable server using nss\_ldap, possibly leading to theft of
user credentials or information disclosure (e.g. Dovecot returning
wrong mailbox contents).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All nss\_ldap users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-auth/nss_ldap-258"
```

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

 **Processor compatibility**

PowerPC CPUs can operate in two modes: *big-endian* and *little-endian*.

* The **ppc** and **ppc64** stages are *big-endian* stages and can be used with *any PowerPC* CPU, including some old Apple™ hardware.
* The **ppc64le** stages are *little-endian* stages and are created for running on *POWER8 and newer* CPUs.
* The **power9le** stages are *little-endian* stages optimized exclusively for *POWER9* CPUs.

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=367461#c0)  Josh Bressers    2007-11-05 20:58:22 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #154314](show_bug.cgi?id=154314 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - nss_ldap randomly replying with wrong user's data") +++  Description of problem: Second time already when I hear nss_ldap is replying with wrong results and causing peoples' mails to be shown to wrong people:  <http://www.dovecot.org/list/dovecot/2005-March/006345.html> <http://www.dovecot.org/list/dovecot/2005-April/006859.html>  Something should really be done about this. At the very least I'm adding a check to make sure getpwnam() returns the same user name that is being requested, and if not put out some huge warnings about something being broken..   -- Additional comment from tjanouse on 2007-02-06 11:08 EST -- Oh yeah, got it.  The problem relies in the fact that if an application is linked against pthread and uses a nss_ldap call and then forks, both processes share the ldap connection, having no locking mechanism, and bad things happen. This is the case with dovecot -- dovecot-auth is linked with pthread and uses pam in forked processes. A race condition causes dovecot-auth to receive a reply that should have gone to pam.  The direct cause of this is that an assumption that __pthread_once is nonnull (ldap-nss.c:1048) implies __pthread_atfork being nonnull (ldap-nss.c:504, bits/libc-lock.h:290) is plain wrong. These two variables have no connection to each other and each of them becomes non-null at the time linker resolves them, which happens upon them being called. And it happens upon them being called in the object that checks for them -- that means calling pthread_atfork in dovecot has no effect on __pthread_atfork value in nss_ldap and vice versa.  For some not so obvious reason __pthread_once is nonnull at the enter of main function, __pthread_atfork is null. This means that nss_ldap assumes we have pthreads working, calls the __libc_atfork (ldap-nss.c:504), which is a noop in this case, and then has no idea about the forks and such.  The easiest solution would be to help nss_ldap's configure find pthreads (telling it to -lpthread), which would make nss_ldap use pthreads directly and avoid such crazy things -- and using those libc internal functions is bad anyway, but I'm not sure whether we should do it.  Also, we could fix it to chech for both __pthread_once and __pthread_atfork  but it would not find them and use the pid-comparing method, which is probably  slower.  I hope this information helps :)   -- Additional comment from tjanouse on 2007-05-10 09:16 EST -- The upstream has accepted my two patches:  <http://people.redhat.com/tjanouse/dovecot/154314/sent_upstream/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=367461#c1)  Josh Bressers    2007-11-05 21:00:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 248591](attachment.cgi?id=248591&action=diff "Patch from above URL for posterity") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=248591&action=edit "Patch from above URL for posterity") Patch from above URL for posterity   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=367461#c2)  Josh Bressers    2007-11-05 21:00:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 248601](attachment.cgi?id=248601&action=diff "Patch from above URL for posterity") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=248601&action=edit "Patch from above URL for posterity") Patch from above URL for posterity   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=367461#c3)  Vincent Danen    2010-12-22 23:13:53 UTC  ``` This was addressed via:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 5 (RHSA-2008:0389) Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 4 (RHSA-2008:0715)   ``` |  |

# [Dovecot] Authentication and the wrong mailbox?

```
I just migrated from UW-imap to dovecot last night.  After some tweaking
of the dovecot.conf file, disabling xinetd's entries, firing up the
dovecot daemon, and copying the .mailboxlist to .subscriptions for all
users, things looked to be going just fine!

I received a call this morning from a user stating that they had all of
*my* emails in *their* inbox!  They don't know when it happened as their
machine POP's email off every 5-10 minutes or so, but we were able to
isolate it to a 8hr period last night.

Further investigation showed that at some time through the evening,
dovecot freaked out during the authentication phase and for some bizzare
reason, when the user connected via POP3, they were able to download all
of my inbox!

Additionally, by the time I was looking in to it, NO users could
authenticate via dovecot, and, hence, no one had access to email.

Restarting dovecot resolved the issue, but I have my doubts about it
being truly resolved.

I'm going to run some tests (what little I can think of), but this is
the first time I have ever experienced a situation such as this.  One
thing for UW is that this situation never happened, and I've only had
dovecot running for about 13hrs.

Any ideas as to how or why this may have happened, and how it can be
prevented, would be wonderful.

-Rich

At the very least I'm adding a check to make sure getpwnam() returns the same user name that is being requested, and if not put out some huge warnings about something being broken..  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):   How reproducible: Sometimes  Steps to Reproduce: Install Dovecot with nss_pam enabled. Try logging in enough times with different users and see how at some point it shows you wrong user's mailbox.   Additional info:   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c3)  Warren Togami    2005-04-17 10:56:38 UTC  ``` Thanks for the notification Timo.  In order to reproduce this, do you actually have to be using nss_ldap for user authentication?  Any idea how to valgrind this code path?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c4)  Nalin Dahyabhai    2005-04-18 18:11:03 UTC  ``` On the system where this happens, what does the PAM configuration look like?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c5)  Warren Togami    2005-04-19 06:17:37 UTC  ``` Hi Josh Burley, we need information about your PAM configuration in order to help diagnose and fix this problem.  Could you please help us?    ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c6)  Josh Burley    2005-04-19 17:15:16 UTC  ``` Sure... there's nothing fancy in there. It's simply the default /etc/ldap.conf that was installed, and I updated it with my LDAP tree's structure, and the Manager to bind with.  What information are you looking for?   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c7)  Timo Sirainen    2005-04-21 19:38:13 UTC  ``` I'm pretty sure it's nss_ldap specific problem. Never heard of it happening with anything else. And the  code in Dovecot that uses it is really simple as well. Just calling getpwnam() multiple times in a process  with no threads. At some point it then returns some previously authenticated user's data.  Perhaps LDAP query fails and it's not checking the error value properly, and just returns the struct  uninitialized (and filled with previous lookup's data)?  No idea how to debug this, I'm not using Fedora or nss_ldap myself..   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c8)  Timo Sirainen    2005-04-21 19:44:17 UTC  ``` Oh, and does PAM affect this somehow? Dovecot is doing PAM lookups in separate short-living  processes, so PAM has never been called before nss_ldap lookups within same process.    ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c9)  Tomas Mraz    2005-04-25 18:04:35 UTC  ``` I was trying to investigate it but I has been unable to reproduce it. The PAM calls shouldn't really matter as they are called in forked child process. I've made a testing binary which called getpwnam randomly on various user accounts stored in LDAP and it always returned consistent results.  Perhaps more information would be needed - the LDAP server vendor and version, what kind of network link was between the LDAP server and the Dovecot server. Exact versions of nss_ldap, glibc, openldap and dovecot packages...    ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c10)  Warren Togami    2005-05-16 08:35:42 UTC  ``` ping Josh   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c11)  Timo Sirainen    2005-05-16 10:47:42 UTC  ``` Maybe it can be only reproduced with Dovecot. I'm not good at setting up a working LDAP server (or nss_ldap), but I can give an easy way to test it:   - Create 100 or so test accounts to LDAP server named user-0 user-1 etc.  - Give each one a home directory which ends with the user's name  - Patch Dovecot's POP3 server with attached patch  - Run attached pop3test binary. It should print an error whenever home directory's ending doesn't match the user which tried to log in.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c12)  Timo Sirainen    2005-05-16 10:48:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 114416](attachment.cgi?id=114416 "pop3 tester") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=114416&action=edit "pop3 tester") pop3 tester   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c13)  Timo Sirainen    2005-05-16 10:49:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 114417](attachment.cgi?id=114417&action=diff "patch to Dovecot's pop3 code") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=114417&action=edit "patch to Dovecot's pop3 code") patch to Dovecot's pop3 code   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c14)  Miloslav Trmač    2005-05-21 14:34:38 UTC  ``` That indeed allows reproducing the bug (on a rawhide-ish system), but only sometimes; most of the time the tester very soon stops, waiting for dovecot's response to PASS; I don't know what dovecot is waiting for ( (getent passwd) replies instantly, so it probably isn't the LDAP server), or why it sometimes works fine.  I have also attempted to reproduce the "same" situation by creating 100 processes, each calling getpwnam(). This found no inconsistencies at all.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c15)  Timo Sirainen    2005-05-21 15:02:41 UTC  ``` Can you check if the patch in [bug #154315](show_bug.cgi?id=154315 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - nss_ldap brokeness prevention attempt") makes Dovecot notice the problem? I'd just like to verify that this really is nss_ldap problem and not a Dovecot problem which for some reason has only been noticed with nss_ldap.  I don't know why the tester would stop.. It creates multiple connections anyway, they all stop? It should slow down if the given password is invalid, but it shouldn't completely stop even then.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c16)  Miloslav Trmač    2005-05-28 21:14:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 114944](attachment.cgi?id=114944 "bzip2'ed syslog (*.*) during the test") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=114944&action=edit "bzip2'ed syslog (*.*) during the test") bzip2'ed syslog (*.*) during the test  It is still not as deterministic as I'd like, but adding the debugging patch makes it much more likely to happen.  This seems to point outside of dovecot; maybe someone can decipher the logs faster than me.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c17)  Josh Bressers    2005-11-02 21:33:30 UTC  ``` This issue has started to get stale.

Or maybe loses LDAP connection for whatever reason. Looking at the log above there are also some LDAP connection errors before the Dovecot error.    ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c19)  Petr Rockai    2006-01-18 08:39:23 UTC  ``` nscd sounds like a not completely unlikely reason... Is the problem  reproducible with nscd turned off? Anyhow, i will apply the    check from [bug 154315](show_bug.cgi?id=154315 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - nss_ldap brokeness prevention attempt") in a bit, so at least dovecot should cope with it  somewhat.    ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c20)  Matthew Miller    2006-07-10 21:42:13 UTC  ``` Fedora Core 3 is now maintained by the Fedora Legacy project for security updates only.

These are the versions used: dovecot-0.99.11-8.1.EL4 nss_ldap-226-17 openldap-2.2.13-6.4E  (I had to modify the pop3 tester to compile with RHEL5 dovecot)   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c24)  Tomas Janousek    2007-01-16 11:00:40 UTC  ``` And, after trying the second time, it seemed to work for quite a long time but then, after issuing "service nscd stop", it happened.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c25)  Tomas Janousek    2007-01-16 17:24:06 UTC  ``` Forgot to mention that dovecot&nss_ldap&ldap server were running on RHEL4, the tester on RHEL5. I could test this on rawhide as well, if needed.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c26)  Tomas Janousek    2007-02-06 16:08:29 UTC  ``` Oh yeah, got it.  The problem relies in the fact that if an application is linked against pthread and uses a nss_ldap call and then forks, both processes share the ldap connection, having no locking mechanism, and bad things happen. This is the case with dovecot -- dovecot-auth is linked with pthread and uses pam in forked processes. A race condition causes dovecot-auth to receive a reply that should have gone to pam.  The direct cause of this is that an assumption that __pthread_once is nonnull (ldap-nss.c:1048) implies __pthread_atfork being nonnull (ldap-nss.c:504, bits/libc-lock.h:290) is plain wrong. These two variables have no connection to each other and each of them becomes non-null at the time linker resolves them, which happens upon them being called. And it happens upon them being called in the object that checks for them -- that means calling pthread_atfork in dovecot has no effect on __pthread_atfork value in nss_ldap and vice versa.  For some not so obvious reason __pthread_once is nonnull at the enter of main function, __pthread_atfork is null. This means that nss_ldap assumes we have pthreads working, calls the __libc_atfork (ldap-nss.c:504), which is a noop in this case, and then has no idea about the forks and such.  The easiest solution would be to help nss_ldap's configure find pthreads (telling it to -lpthread), which would make nss_ldap use pthreads directly and avoid such crazy things -- and using those libc internal functions is bad anyway, but I'm not sure whether we should do it.  Also, we could fix it to chech for both __pthread_once and __pthread_atfork  but it would not find them and use the pid-comparing method, which is probably  slower.  I hope this information helps :)   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c27)  Timo Sirainen    2007-02-06 16:31:27 UTC  ``` Oh, so the bug was nothing like I imagined :)  Is it possible to close the LDAP connection somehow in the forked process? Does endpwent() do anything?   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c28)  Tomas Janousek    2007-02-06 18:11:03 UTC  ``` If I didn't overlook anything, endpwent does not close the connection. I found no way to do it. Seems like this will have to be fixed in nss_ldap, no workaround this time :)  If anyone wants to play with this, this is a simple reproducer: <http://people.redhat.com/tjanouse/dovecot/154314/ldaptest.c>   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c29)  Tomas Janousek    2007-02-07 15:01:50 UTC  ``` I dug into that a little further and wrote two patches.  The first one is a plain fix of the wrong assumption, leaving the atfork code unused on current glibc: <http://people.redhat.com/tjanouse/dovecot/154314/nss_ldap-226-pthread.patch>  Then I found out the cause of __pthread_atfork being NULL. It's not a dynamic symbol any more, it's being built into the binaries, because it's just a small function calling __register_atfork. So the second patch tries to follow this: <http://people.redhat.com/tjanouse/dovecot/154314/nss_ldap-226-pthread2.patch> It's an ugly abuse of glibc internals, but the original code was as well.  There's probably not much benefit though. openldap uses shutdown(2) before closing the connection so the parent's ldap connection becomes screwed and must be reopened. This is out of my sight though.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c30)  Jakub Jelinek    2007-03-26 08:30:57 UTC  ``` pthread_atfork is defined in libpthread_nonshared.a, so that the handlers are automatically deregistered when a shared library that contains them is dlclosed, otherwise if you call pthread_atfork in some shared library, then dlclose it and then call fork, it would be calling handlers in an already unmapped library, which can either mean crashes or running some unrelated code (if some other library has been mmapped in that place instead).  __register_atfork is provided by libc.so (i.e. always available), I think for nss_ldap the easiest fix would be at configure time check for libpthread_nonshared.a library and if it exists: 1) don't define pthread_atfork as weak, call it directly whenever pthread_once != NULL 2) link libnss_ldap.so.2 with -lpthread_nonshared   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=154314#c31)  Tomas Janousek    2007-04-11 14:15:24 UTC  ``` Jakub, thanks for your hints. I tried it and it works. I don't check for the pthread_once at runtime though, it doesn't seem to be neccessary -- I just call the pthread_atfork using pthread_once/__libc_once.

Package        : libnss-ldap
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-5794
Debian Bug     : 453868

It was reported that a race condition exists in libnss-ldap, an
NSS module for using LDAP as a naming service, which could cause
denial of service attacks when applications use pthreads.

This problem was spotted in the dovecot IMAP/POP server but
potentially affects more programs.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
251-7.5etch1.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 238-1sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 256-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libnss-ldap package.

# Welcome to the Gentoo wiki!

Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!

## Available documentation

To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the [Documentation topic](#Documentation_topics) links provided below.

Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a *Handbook:* or *Project:* prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective *Discussion* pages.

Find something to add or edit? The [*Getting started*](#Getting_started) section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.

Most importantly, the **Gentoo Handbook** is among the best documents found on the wiki:

#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- SUN Java 1.5 and 1.6 update
SUN Java 1.5.0 was brought to update14 and SUN Java 1.6.0 was
brought to update4. Details for the security issues fixed are not
yet publicly known, but the changelog lists several issues marked
as security.
The update also contains timezone update 2007k and was released
for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- nss\_ldap incorrect data
nss\_ldap returned incorrect data under certain circumstances to
the calling process. Some applications could therefore work with
wrong user data (CVE-2007-5794).
This has been fixed for all distributions containing nss\_ldap.
- cairo integer overflows in PNG decoder
The cairo libraries were updated to fix several integer overflows
while decoding PNG images. This can be exploited remotely with
user-assistance to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2007-5503)
Updates have been provided for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE Linux
10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3
- geronimo start script problems
A chown in the SUSE supplied Apache geronimo init script could
change ownership of directories it did not own, due to following
symlinks. The default setup would corrupt /var/tmp on start
of geronimo.
While there is potential to exploit this problem,
the administrator will have likely noticed this before already.
- moodle XSS problems
The install script of moodle is vulnerable to cross site scripting
(XSS). This flaw is only exploitable if moodle isn't fully installed
yet. Therefore it's unlikely to be much of a problem in practice. To
actually exploit it an attacker would have to know about a person
that is just about to install moodle (CVE-2008-0123).
- SDL\_image GIF problems
Specially crafted GIF files could crash the SDL\_image library
(CVE-2006-4484).
Updates have been released for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2
and 10.3.
- python imageop integer overflow
Specially crafted images could trigger an integer overflow in the
imageop module of python (CVE-2007-4965).
Python has been updated on all SUSE Linux based distributions.
- Mysql security problems
The database server MySQL was updated to fix various security
vulnerabilities. Note: not all versions are affected by every bug:

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0715)

## Topic

An updated nss\_ldap package that fixes a security issue and several bugs is
now available.

This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

The nss\_ldap package contains the nss\_ldap and pam\_ldap modules. The
nss\_ldap module is a plug-in which allows applications to retrieve
information about users and groups from a directory server. The pam\_ldap
module allows PAM-aware applications to use a directory server to verify
user passwords.

A race condition was discovered in nss\_ldap, which affected certain
applications that make LDAP connections, such as Dovecot. This could cause
nss\_ldap to answer a request for information about one user with the
information about a different user. (CVE-2007-5794)

As well, this updated package fixes the following bugs:

* in certain situations, on Itanium(R) architectures, when an application

performed an LDAP lookup for a highly populated group, for example,
containing more than 150 members, the application crashed, or may have
caused a segmentation fault. As well, this issue may have caused commands,
such as "ls", to return a "ber\_free\_buf: Assertion" error.

* when an application enumerated members of a netgroup, the nss\_ldap

module returned a successful status result and the netgroup name, even
when the netgroup did not exist. This behavior was not consistent with
other modules. In this updated package, nss\_ldap no longer returns a
successful status when the netgroup does not exist.

* in master and slave server environments, with systems that were

configured to use a read-only directory server, if user log in attempts
were denied because their passwords had expired, and users attempted to
immediately change their passwords, the replication server returned an LDAP
referral, instructing the pam\_ldap module to resissue its request to a
different server; however, the pam\_ldap module failed to do so. In these
situations, an error such as the following occurred:

LDAP password information update failed: Can't contact LDAP server
Insufficient 'write' privilege to the 'userPassword' attribute of entry
[entry]

In this updated package, password changes are allowed when binding against
a slave server, which resolves this issue.

* when a system used a directory server for naming information, and

"nss\_initgroups\_ignoreusers root" was configured in "/etc/ldap.conf",
dbus-daemon-1 would hang. Running the "service messagebus start" command
did not start the service, and it did not fail, which would stop the boot
process if it was not cancelled.

As well, this updated package upgrades nss\_ldap to the version as shipped
with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

Users of nss\_ldap are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
resolves these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_58_10188>

| [Description](#c0)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-07 19:29:49 UTC  ``` The problem relies in the fact that if an application is linked against pthread and uses a nss_ldap call and then forks, both processes share the ldap connection, having no locking mechanism, and bad things happen. This is the case with dovecot -- dovecot-auth is linked with pthread and uses pam in forked processes. A race condition causes dovecot-auth to receive a reply that should have gone to pam.  The direct cause of this is that an assumption that __pthread_once is nonnull (ldap-nss.c:1048) implies __pthread_atfork being nonnull (ldap-nss.c:504, bits/libc-lock.h:290) is plain wrong. These two variables have no connection to each other and each of them becomes non-null at the time linker resolves them, which happens upon them being called. And it happens upon them being called in the object that checks for them -- that means calling pthread_atfork in dovecot has no effect on __pthread_atfork value in nss_ldap and vice versa.  For some not so obvious reason __pthread_once is nonnull at the enter of main function, __pthread_atfork is null. This means that nss_ldap assumes we have pthreads working, calls the __libc_atfork (ldap-nss.c:504), which is a noop in this case, and then has no idea about the forks and such.  The easiest solution would be to help nss_ldap's configure find pthreads (telling it to -lpthread), which would make nss_ldap use pthreads directly and avoid such crazy things -- and using those libc internal functions is bad anyway, but I'm not sure whether we should do it.  Also, we could fix it to chech for both __pthread_once and __pthread_atfork  but it would not find them and use the pid-comparing method, which is probably  slower.  I hope this information helps :) ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-07 19:30:09 UTC  ``` ldap-bugs please advise. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Robin Johnson   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2007-11-08 03:08:35 UTC  ``` Both patches on the RH Bugzie URL are already present upstream as of nss_ldap-256, so all we need to do is stabilize nss_ldap-257.2 (which has been in the tree 29 days already).  I'm aware of [bug 198408](show_bug.cgi?id=198408 "RESOLVED FIXED - sys-auth/nss_ldap-257.2 WANT_AUTOMAKE=1.9") that was a build weirdness, and [bug 165638](show_bug.cgi?id=165638 "RESOLVED FIXED - sys-auth/nss_ldap-254 fails build with kerberos USE flag and app-crypt/heimdal-0.7.2-r3 due to undeclared GSS_S_COMPLETE") for the kerberos folk - but neither of these should hold back 257.2 going to stable.  Also, this raises [bug 197467](show_bug.cgi?id=197467 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-baselibs: Upgrade to nss_ldap 257 due to bug #162355") to being security critical, you'll have to chase amd64 there to bump that package and stabilize/issue GLSA. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Robin Johnson   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2007-11-08 03:20:14 UTC  ``` minor update, I just put nss_ldap-258 into the tree, it contained a singular upstream change (5 lines only) fixing nss_srv_domain usage, and I put the kerberos fix in at the same time, and hopefully resolved the build [bug 198408](show_bug.cgi?id=198408 "RESOLVED FIXED - sys-auth/nss_ldap-257.2 WANT_AUTOMAKE=1.9"). It may be a better candidate than 257.2 for that reason. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-08 03:28:40 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=198390#c3)) > and hopefully resolved the build [bug 198408](show_bug.cgi?id=198408 "RESOLVED FIXED - sys-auth/nss_ldap-257.2 WANT_AUTOMAKE=1.9"). > It may be a better candidate than 257.2 for that reason.
