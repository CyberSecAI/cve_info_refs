  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-5638",
      "description": "Nortel IP Phones are vulnerable to a surveillance mode attack. A malicious user can send spoofed 'Open Audio Stream' messages with a range of ID numbers. Due to the use of only 16 bits for the ID, sending 65536 messages with different IDs guarantees a match. If the ID matches the expected one between the signaling server and the IP phone, the phone opens an audio stream to the attacker's host, enabling eavesdropping.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the insufficient use of a 16-bit ID for authentication when opening an audio stream, instead of the 32 bits available in the RUDP protocol.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient authentication using a short ID number (16-bit) which is easily bruteforced",
        "Lack of proper validation of the ID number in 'Open Audio Stream' messages"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can remotely eavesdrop on conversations made through the vulnerable IP phone.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending spoofed 'Open Audio Stream' messages to a vulnerable IP Phone.",
           "Brute-forcing the 16-bit ID by sending 65536 messages with different IDs."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the capability to send spoofed UNIStim messages to the target IP Phone and know the network environment.",
        "affected_products": [
        "Nortel IP Phone 1140E",
        "IP Softphone 2050",
         "and other Nortel IP phones (see associated products on the Nortel advisory)"
        ],
      "additional_notes": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending 65536 spoofed messages, but sending too many messages may cause the IP phone to crash and require a manual reboot."
