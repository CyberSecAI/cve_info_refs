{
  "CVE-2007-5232": {
    "Root cause": "A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) with applet caching.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The JRE's applet caching mechanism fails to properly restrict network connections made by untrusted applets.",
      "Applets downloaded from malicious websites can bypass intended network restrictions."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted applet to:\n\n- Make network connections to network services on machines other than the one that the applet was downloaded from.\n- Access or exploit network resources and vulnerabilities on these network services.\n- Execute arbitrary code outside of the Java sandbox.\n- Obtain sensitive information.\n- Create, modify, rename, and read local files.\n- Execute local applications.\n- Establish connections in the local network.\n- Bypass the same origin policy.\n- Cause a Denial of Service via multiple vectors.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A user visits a website containing a malicious Java applet.",
         "A user starts an application in Java Web Start."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to host malicious Java applets on a website",
      "Entice a user to visit the website or to start a Java Web Start application."
    ]
