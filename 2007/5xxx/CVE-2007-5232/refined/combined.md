How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# IBM JDK/JRE: Multiple vulnerabilities â GLSA **200806-11**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in IBM Java Development Kit (JDK)
and Java Runtime Environment (JRE), resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/ibm-jdk-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.7**revision >= **1.4.2.11** |

| Package | **dev-java/ibm-jre-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.7**revision >= **1.4.2.11** |

### Background

The IBM Java Development Kit (JDK) and the IBM Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the IBM Java platform.

### Description

Because of sharing the same codebase, IBM JDK and JRE are affected by
the vulnerabilities mentioned in GLSA 200804-20.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted applet
on a website or start an application in Java Web Start to execute
arbitrary code outside of the Java sandbox and of the Java security
restrictions with the privileges of the user running Java. The attacker
could also obtain sensitive information, create, modify, rename and
read local files, execute local applications, establish connections in
the local network, bypass the same origin policy, and cause a Denial of
Service via multiple vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All IBM JDK 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jdk-bin-1.5.0.7"
```

All IBM JDK 1.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jdk-bin-1.4.2.11"
```

All IBM JRE 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jre-bin-1.5.0.7"
```

All IBM JRE 1.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jre-bin-1.4.2.11"
```

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted applet
on a website or start an application in Java Web Start to execute
arbitrary code outside of the Java sandbox and of the Java security
restrictions with the privileges of the user running Java. The attacker
could also obtain sensitive information, create, modify, rename and
read local files, execute local applications, establish connections in
the local network, bypass the same origin policy, and cause a Denial of
Service via multiple vectors.

### Workaround

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Sun Java JRE vulnerable to unauthorized network access

#### Vulnerability Note VU#336105

Original Release Date: 2007-10-05 | Last Revised: 2007-10-12

---

### Overview

The Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) contains a vulnerability that may allow unintended access to network resources.

### Description

| The Sun Java Runtime Environment ([JRE](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html)) allows users to run [Java](http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/) applications in a browser or as standalone programs. Sun has made the JRE available for multiple operating systems.  Per Sunsolve Document ID [103079](http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-103079-1):*A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) with applet caching may allow an untrusted applet that is downloaded from a malicious website to make network connections to network services on machines other than the one that the applet was downloaded from. This may allow network resources (such as web pages) and vulnerabilities (that exist on these network services) which are not otherwise normally accessible to be accessed or exploited.*The following java products are affected by this vulnerability:JDK and JRE 6 Update 2 and earlierJDK and JRE 5.0 Update 12 and earlierSDK and JRE 1.4.2\_15 and earlierSDK and JRE 1.3.1\_20 and earlier |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to run a Java applet on a vulnerable system to gain access to network connections to resources not otherwise accessible and expose vulnerabilitites within those network resources. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**Sun has released an upgrade to address this issue. See Sunsolve Document ID [103079](http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-103079-1) for more details. To adjust the JRE update settings, see the [update](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/deployment/deployment-guide/jcp.html#update) section of the Java deployment guide. |
| --- |

| **Disable Java**  Disabling the Java browser plugin may prevent a malicious webpage from exploiting this vulnerability. See the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.cert.org/archive/html/securing_browser.html) for instructions on how to disable Java in your browser.**Use NoScript**Using the Mozilla Firefox NoScript extension to whitelist web sites that can run scripts and access installed plugins will mitigate this vulnerability. See the NoScript FAQ for more information. |

**Zypp-Patch-Number:** 4687

**Release:**  20071115

**Obsoletes:** none

### Indications

Everyone using the IBM Java JRE/SDK should install this patch.

### Contraindications

None.

### Description

The IBM Java JRE and SDK have been brought to release 1.5.0 SR6, containing several bugfixes, including fixes for the following security issues:

* A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) with applet caching may allow an untrusted applet that is downloaded from a malicious website to make network connections to network services on machines other than the one that the applet was downloaded from. This may allow network resources (such as web pages) and vulnerabilities (that exist on these network services) which are not otherwise normally accessible to be accessed or exploited. (CVE-2007-5232)
* A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) may allow malicious Javascript code that is downloaded by a browser from a malicious website to make network connections, through Java APIs, to network services on machines other than the one that the Javascript code was downloaded from. This may allow network resources (such as web pages) and vulnerabilities (that exist on these network services) which are not otherwise normally accessible to be accessed or exploited. (CVE-2007-5274)
* A second vulnerability in the JRE may allow an untrusted applet that is downloaded from a malicious website through a web proxy to make network connections to network services on machines other than the one that the applet was downloaded from. This may allow network resources (such as web pages) and vulnerabilities (that exist on these network services) which are not otherwise normally accessible to be accessed or exploited. (CVE-2007-5273)
* An untrusted Java Web Start application may write arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2007-5236)
* Three separate vulnerabilities may allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to determine the location of the Java Web Start cache. (CVE-2007-5238)
* n untrusted Java Web Start application or Java applet may move or copy arbitrary files by requesting the user of the application or applet to drag and drop a file from the Java Web Start application or Java applet window. (CVE-2007-5239)
* An untrusted applet may display an over-sized window so that the applet warning banner is not visible to the user running the untrusted applet. (CVE-2007-5240)
* A vulnerability in the font parsing code in the Java Runtime Environment may allow an untrusted applet to elevate its privileges. For example, an applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or execute local applications that are accessible to the user running the untrusted applet. (CVE-2007-4381)
* he Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) that is included in various releases of the Java Runtime Environment does not correctly process SSL/TLS handshake requests. This vulnerability may be exploited to create a Denial of Service (DoS) condition to the system as a whole on a server that listens for SSL/TLS connections using JSSE for SSL/TLS support. (CVE-2007-3698)

For more information refer to <http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/alerts/>

Additionally, a concurrency bug has been fixed (Novell Bug 330713).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
IBM Java 1.4.2 was updated to SR10 and IBM Java 1.5.0 was updated to
SR7 to fix various security issues:
- CVE-2008-1196: A buffer overflow vulnerability in Java Web Start
may allow an untrusted Java Web Start application that is downloaded
from a website to elevate its privileges. For example, an untrusted
Java Web Start application may grant itself permissions to read and
write local files or execute local applications that are accessible
to the user running the untrusted application.
- CVE-2008-1195: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment may
allow JavaScript(TM) code that is downloaded by a browser to make
connections to network services on the system that the browser runs
on, through Java APIs, This may allow files (that are accessible
through these network services) or vulnerabilities (that exist on
these network services) which are not otherwise normally accessible
to be accessed or exploited.
- CVE-2008-1192: A vulnerability in the Java Plug-in may an untrusted
applet to bypass same origin policy and leverage this flaw to
execute local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
- CVE-2008-1190: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may allow an
untrusted Java Web Start application to elevate its privileges. For
example, an application may grant itself permissions to read and
write local files or execute local applications that are accessible
to the user running the untrusted application.
- CVE-2008-1189: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment may allow an untrusted applet or application to elevate
its privileges. For example, an applet may grant itself permissions
to read and write local files or execute local applications that
are accessible to the user running the untrusted applet.
- CVE-2008-1187: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
with parsing XML data may allow an untrusted applet or application
to elevate its privileges. For example, an applet may read certain
URL resources (such as some files and web pages).
- CVE-2007-5232: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with applet caching may allow an untrusted applet that is
downloaded from a malicious website to make network connections to
network services on machines other than the one that the applet was
downloaded from. This may allow network resources (such as web pages)
and vulnerabilities (that exist on these network services) which
are not otherwise normally accessible to be accessed or exploited.
- CVE-2007-5274: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
may allow malicious Javascript code that is downloaded by a browser
from a malicious website to make network connections, through Java
APIs, to network services on machines other than the one that the
Javascript code was downloaded from. This may allow network resources
(such as web pages) and vulnerabilities (that exist on these network
services) which are not otherwise normally accessible to be accessed
or exploited.
- CVE-2007-5273: A second vulnerability in the JRE may allow an
untrusted applet that is downloaded from a malicious website through
a web proxy to make network connections to network services on
machines other than the one that the applet was downloaded from. This
may allow network resources (such as web pages) and vulnerabilities
(that exist on these network services) which are not otherwise
normally accessible to be accessed or exploited.
- CVE-2007-5236: An untrusted Java Web Start application may
write arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running
the application.
- CVE-2007-5238: Three separate vulnerabilities may allow an untrusted
Java Web Start application to determine the location of the Java
Web Start cache.
- CVE-2007-5239: An untrusted Java Web Start application or Java
applet may move or copy arbitrary files by requesting the user of
the application or applet to drag and drop a file from the Java
Web Start application or Java applet window.
- CVE-2007-5240: An untrusted applet may display an over-sized window
so that the applet warning banner is not visible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
- CVE-2007-4381: A vulnerability in the font parsing code in the
Java Runtime Environment may allow an untrusted applet to elevate
its privileges. For example, an applet may grant itself permissions
to read and write local files or execute local applications that
are accessible to the user running the untrusted applet.
- CVE-2007-3698: The Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) that is
included in various releases of the Java Runtime Environment does not
correctly process SSL/TLS handshake requests. This vulnerability may
be exploited to create a Denial of Service (DoS) condition to the
system as a whole on a server that listens for SSL/TLS connections
using JSSE for SSL/TLS support.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart running instances of IBM Java.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

Presentation Title: WABISABILABI: The Exploit Marketplace Project

Presentation Details:

Three days after its launch, the Wabisabilabi project attracted the worldÃÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¬Ã¢ÂÂ¢s attention. For the good and for the bad, the press covered the project in all its aspects, generating and endless round of comment threads on specialized forums. The project got the attention of the financial press, hitting the Economist and Forbes. The speech will let you hear directly from WABISABILABIÃÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¬Ã¢ÂÂ¢s Strategy Director the project philosophy, business model and milestones as well as the challenges the project has to overcome in the future.

- history of the research in the security field

- WABISABILABI: a name, a philosophy

- current status of the security market: exploiting the security researcherÃÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¬Ã¢ÂÂ¢s work for free

- the black security market: a myth? A reality?

- the traditional security vendor business model VS WabisabilabiÃÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¬Ã¢ÂÂ¢s one

- is it ethical? Major criticisms do have ground?

- legal aspects of a security marketplace: the results of one year of legal investigations

- the economical models: auction, dutch auction, exclusive sale

- the big dilemma: to disclose or not to disclose?

**[Registration for HITBSecConf2007 - Malaysia](https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2007kl/register/index.html)** is now open! We have moved our conference to the bigger and better Hilton KL Sentral; Kuala Lumpurâs newest 5-star hotel centrally located in the heart of Kuala Lumpur and a mere 28 minutes from the airport via the KLIA Express.

Weâre expecting over 800 attendees to join us from around the world for this yearâs Malaysian leg and we promise they will not be disappointed! HITBSecConf2007 - Malaysia will be the **largest network security event in Asia** with **4 keynote speakers** and over **40 of the worldâs leading researchers** and security experts under one roof. Some of the highlights:

7 Tracks of [Hands-On Technical Trainings](https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2007kl/index.html_page_id%3D60.html)

Day 1 Keynote Speakers: [Lance Spitzner](index.html_page_id%3D65.html) and [Mikko Hypponen](index.html_page_id%3D124.html)

Day 2 Keynote Speakers: [Mark âPhiber Optikâ Abene](index.html_page_id%3D64.html) and [Emmanuel Goldstein](index.html_page_id%3D139.html)

HITB Cinema: As part of our yearly charity initiative, we are organizing [screenings of Freedom Downtime and Urchin](cinema/index.html). Freedom Downtime, directed and produced by Emmanuel Goldstein is the story of computer hacker Kevin Mitnick, imprisoned without bail for nearly five years while Urchin is an independent production written and directed by John Harlacher and stars Mark Abene as âThe Inside Manâ and Emmanuel Goldstein as âThe Outside Manâ. Shot illegally in the subways, sewers, and streets of New York City âUrchinâ is a prime example of guerrilla cinema made possible by new technology. This will be the **first time in Asia Pacific** that these movies are being shown to the public and all proceeds from these screenings will go to the [Malaysian National Cancer Council - MAKNA](http://www.makna.org.my).

Capture The Flag: With cash prizes worth USD6,000 this yearsâ [Capture The Flag](https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2007kl/index.html_page_id%3D61.html) game has already received confirmation of participation from Padocon from Korea (last yearâs champions), NDMTeam from Bulgaria, Army Strong comprising members of the US Army and Zone-H from Italy.

Zone-H/HITB Hacking Challenge: Zone-H in colaboration with the Hack in The Box crew will organize a [6-level web-based hackgame](https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2007kl/index.html_page_id%3D141.html) in which individual participants will be challenged to try to beat the hackgame in the shortest possible time. Based on the original game developed by Zone-H in 2005, there will be no need to bring your own exploits or your own laptop.

Lock Picking Village (LPV): Deviant Olam, Eric Michaud and Q who are members from the The Open Organization of Lockpickers (TOOOL USA) will be running a [Lock Picking Village](https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2007kl/index.html_page_id%3D140.html) at the conference in which attendees will be invited to try their hands at bumping and other physical security bypass methods! If you think your home locks are secure, youâre more than welcome to bring them along and see for yourself how easily they can be bypassed.

BZFlag Competition:  Organized by members of the US Army, attendees to HITBSecConf2007 will be able to blow off some steam in a [BZFlag arena](https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2007kl/index.html_page_id%3D142.html). BZFlag is an online multiplayer cross-platform open source 3D tank battle!

## [Call for Papers now open](index.html_p%3D138.html)

Filed under: [Main Page](index.html_cat%3D1.html "View all posts in Main Page") â Administrator @ 11:32 am

The CFP for HITBSecConf2007 - Malaysia is now open. HITBSecConf - Malaysia is the premier network security event for the region and the largest gathering of hackers in Asia. Our 2007 event is expected to attract over 700 attendees from around the world and will see 4 keynote speakers in addition to 40 deep-knowledge technical researchers presenting over two-days.

Being a deep-knowledge technical conference, talks that are **more technical** or that discuss **new and never before seen attack methods** are of more interest than a subject that has been covered several times before. Summaries not exceeding 250 words should be submitted (in plain text format) to cfp -at- hackinthebox.org for review and possible inclusion in the programme.

Submissions are due no later than **1st May 2007**. For further details, please take a look at the [CFP page](https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2007kl/index.html_page_id%3D72.html).

Notes: These vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely only if the
attacker has access to the service console network.
Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the
service console be isolated from the VM network. Please see
[http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726](/resources/techresources/726) for more
information on VMware security best practices.

The currently installed versions of Tomcat and JRE depend
on your patch deployment history.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# JRockit: Multiple vulnerabilities â GLSA **200804-28**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in BEA JRockit.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/jrockit-jdk-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.14** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **1.4.2.16**>= **1.5.0.14** |

### Background

JRockit is BEA WebLogic's J2SE Development Kit.

### Description

Because of sharing the same codebase, JRockit is affected by the
vulnerabilities mentioned in GLSA 200804-20.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted applet
on a website or start an application in Java Web Start to execute
arbitrary code outside of the Java sandbox and of the Java security
restrictions with the privileges of the user running Java. The attacker
could also obtain sensitive information, create, modify, rename and
read local files, execute local applications, establish connections in
the local network, bypass the same origin policy, and cause a Denial of
Service via multiple vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All JRockit 1.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/jrockit-jdk-bin-1.4.2.16"
```

All JRockit 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/jrockit-jdk-bin-1.5.0.14"
```
