Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-5840

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the `cmsdir` parameter within the `main.inc.php` file of SyndeoCMS 2.5.01. This parameter is susceptible to remote file inclusion, meaning an attacker can manipulate it to include and execute malicious code from a remote server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation for the `cmsdir` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject a URL pointing to a malicious file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running SyndeoCMS, potentially leading to:
    - Complete server compromise.
    - Data theft or manipulation.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Installation of backdoors for persistent access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `main.inc.php` file, where the `cmsdir` parameter contains a malicious URL.
- **Remote Server:** The attacker needs access to a web server to host the malicious PHP script that will be included by the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network connectivity to the server hosting the vulnerable SyndeoCMS instance.
- **Malicious Code Hosting:** The attacker must have a publicly accessible web server to host the malicious code to be included.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and PHP.

**Exploit Example:**
The provided exploit example is:
`http://site.com/[path]/starnet/themes/c-sky/main.inc.php?cmsdir=shell?`

This shows how the `cmsdir` parameter is used to inject the URL of the attacker's shell. The `shell?` would then execute the code included.

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit was published on November 4, 2007.
- The vulnerable application is SyndeoCMS version 2.5.01.
- The vulnerability is specific to the handling of the `cmsdir` parameter in `main.inc.php`.
- The platform affected is PHP.
