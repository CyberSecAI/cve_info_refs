# SiteBar: Multiple issues — GLSA **200711-05**

Multiple issues have been identified in SiteBar that might allow execution
of arbitrary code and arbitrary file disclosure.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/sitebar** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.3.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.3.9** |

### Background

SiteBar is a PHP application that allows users to store their bookmarks
on a web server.

### Description

Tim Brown discovered these multiple issues: the translation module does
not properly sanitize the value to the "dir" parameter (CVE-2007-5491,
CVE-2007-5694); the translation module also does not sanitize the
values of the "edit" and "value" parameters which it passes to eval()
and include() (CVE-2007-5492, CVE-2007-5693); the log-in command does
not validate the URL to redirect users to after logging in
(CVE-2007-5695); SiteBar also contains several cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities (CVE-2007-5692).

### Impact

An authenticated attacker in the "Translators" or "Admins" group could
execute arbitrary code, read arbitrary files and possibly change their
permissions with the privileges of the user running the web server by
passing a specially crafted parameter string to the "translator.php"
file. An unauthenticated attacker could entice a user to browse a
specially crafted URL, allowing for the execution of script code in the
context of the user's browser, for the theft of browser credentials or
for a redirection to an arbitrary web site after login.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All SiteBar users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/sitebar-3.3.9"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : sitebar
Vulnerability  : various
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-5491, CVE-2007-5492, CVE-2007-5693, CVE-2007-5694, CVE-2007-5695, CVE-2007-5692
Debian Bug     : 447135, 448690, 448689

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in sitebar, a
web based bookmark manager written in PHP.  The Common Vulnerabilities
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-5491
   A directory traversal vulnerability in the translation module allows
   remote authenticated users to chmod arbitrary files to 0777 via ".."
   sequences in the lang parameter.

CVE-2007-5492
   A static code injection vulnerability in the translation module allows
   a remote authenticated user to execute arbitrary PHP code via the value
   parameter.

CVE-2007-5693
   An eval injection vulnerability in the translation module allows
   remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary PHP code via the
   edit parameter in an upd cmd action.

CVE-2007-5694
   A path traversal vulnerability in the translation module allows
   remote authenticated users to read arbitrary files via an absolute
   path in the 'dir' parameter.

CVE-2007-5695
   An error in command.php allows remote attackers to redirect users
   to arbitrary web sites via the forward parameter in a Log In action.

CVE-2007-5692
   Multiple cross site scripting flaws allow remote attackers to inject
   arbitrary script or HTML fragments into several scripts.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problem have been fixed in version
3.3.8-7etch1.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.6-7.1sarge1

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version
3.3.8-12.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your sitebar package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade

| [Description](#c0)  Stephane Bonnell    2007-10-14 10:01:18 UTC  ``` Version bump. This is mainly a security release, please read the change log.  Reproducible: Always ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Jakub Moc (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-14 12:42:35 UTC  ``` <snip> Multiple security issues fixed in the translation module which could be exploited by user having admin or translation access to SiteBar. A workaround for version 3.3.8 is to delete the file translator.php, it only used for translation of SiteBar strings into other languages. </snip>  CVE-2006-3320 was already fixed in [Bug 142597](show_bug.cgi?id=142597 "RESOLVED FIXED - www-apps/sitebar - cross-site scripting vulnerability (CVE-2006-3320)"). ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-14 19:13:24 UTC  ``` I found two issues in the diff of translator.php: 1) Directory traversal via the $lang parameter that allows chmod'ing    arbitrary files 0777. 2) Arbitrary PHP command execution via $value parameter.  Both are only exploitable for authenticated users. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-14 19:14:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 133465](attachment.cgi?id=133465 "SiteBar-3.3.8-translator-security.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=133465&action=edit "SiteBar-3.3.8-translator-security.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=133465&action=diff "SiteBar-3.3.8-translator-security.patch")] SiteBar-3.3.8-translator-security.patch  Security relevant parts of the release. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-14 19:21:44 UTC  ``` web-apps, please advise. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-15 00:07:26 UTC  ``` According to upstream, this is only exploitable when not running the default configuration: "Those bugs are exploitable by users having access to translations and  only on installations, where admin granted web server rights to write to  the locales subdirectories (should not be usually the case by default).  The users who have access to translations are limited to members of  Admins and Translators group. Translators group is not created by default." ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Gunnar Wrobel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-16 08:12:23 UTC  ``` Yes, this is correct. I've coded a while on sitebar and it would take active user intervention to open these holes. So this does not really affect security.  Anyhow I bumped to 3.3.9 and dropped the stable keyword on ppc.  Maybe ppc could stabilze that version and we can remove 3.3.8 so no user has to wonder if sitebar is safe or not.  Thanks! ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-16 11:10:27 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=195810#c6)) > Yes, this is correct. I've coded a while on sitebar and it would take active > user intervention to open these holes. So this does not really affect security.  It still is a privilege escalation when you give people "translation" rights in the system and they can execute code on the server or change files. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-18 08:05:19 UTC  ``` There were more issues revealed than the ones mentioned in the release notes and fixed by the patch above. They allow code another way to execute and retrieve files for arbitrary users, and XSS / redirection flaws for unauthenticated users.  See: <http://www.nth-dimension.org.uk/pub/NDSA20071016.txt.asc> ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Tobias Scherbaum (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-18 17:03:25 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Gunnar Wrobel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-18 17:13:56 UTC  ``` thanks, removing insecure versions. webapps done here ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-18 19:50:54 UTC  ``` glsa filed. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-06 23:05:39 UTC  ``` GLSA 200711-05 ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
