The provided content relates to CVE-2007-5381.
The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the Cisco IOS Line Printer Daemon (LPD).

- Root cause: The IOS LPD service does not properly check the length of the hostname of the router, leading to a buffer overflow when the hostname is 99 characters or longer, due to a call to the sprintf() function.
- Vulnerability: Buffer Overflow.
- Impact: Attackers can execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service (DoS).
- Attack vector: Sending a crafted request to the LPD service (port 515/tcp) with an overly long hostname.
- Required capabilities: The attacker needs to be able to connect to the LPD service on the target Cisco IOS device.
