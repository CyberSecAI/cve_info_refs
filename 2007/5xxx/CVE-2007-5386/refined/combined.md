Package        : phpmyadmin
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitising
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-5589 CVE-2007-5386

Omer Singer of the DigiTrust Group discovered several vulnerabilities in
phpMyAdmin, an application to administrate MySQL over the WWW. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-5589

    phpMyAdmin allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script
    or HTML in the context of a logged in user's session (cross site
    scripting).

CVE-2007-5386

    phpMyAdmin, when accessed by a browser that does not URL-encode
    requests, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script

## PMASA-2007-5

**Announcement-ID:** PMASA-2007-5

**Date:** 2007-10-15

### Summary

XSS vulnerability

### Description

We received an advisory from Omer Singer, The DigiTrust Group, and we wish to thank him for his work.

It was possible to trigger this attack on setup.php.

### Severity

We consider this vulnerability to be serious; however, we could only trigger it when using Internet Explorer with the 'send URLs as UTF8' setting disabled. The default value of this setting being 'enabled' reduces the impact of this problem.

### Affected Versions

Probably all versions before 2.11.1.1.

### Solution

Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.11.1.1 or newer.

### References
