Prior to Sep 27, 2024, if a user generated a terminal command via Cursor's Terminal Cmd-K/Ctrl-K feature and if the user explicitly imported a malicious web page into the Terminal Cmd-K prompt, an attacker with control over the referenced web page could have a significant chance of influencing a language model to output arbitrary commands for execution in the user's terminal. This scenario would require the user explicitly opt-in to including the contents of a compromised webpage, and it would require that the attacker display prompt injection text in the the contents of the compromised webpage. A server-side patch to not stream back newlines or control characters was released on September 27, 2024, within two hours of the issue being reported. Additionally, Cursor 0.42 includes client-side mitigations to prevent any newline or control character from being streamed into the terminal directly. It also contains a new setting, `"cursor.terminal.usePreviewBox"`, which, if set to true, streams the response into a preview box whose contents then have to be manually accepted before being inserted into the terminal. This setting is useful if you're working in a shell environment where commands can be executed without pressing enter or any control character. The patch has been applied server-side, so no additional action is needed, even on older versions of Cursor. Separately, Cursor's maintainers also recommend, as best practice, to only include trusted pieces of context in prompts.](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2024-48919/ "Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI.

Title:
------
\* Atheros Vendor Specific Information Element Overflow
Summary:
--------
\* The wireless drivers in some Wi-Fi access points (such as the
ATHEROS-based Linksys WRT350N) do not correctly parse the Atheros vendor
specific information element included in association requests. This
information element is used by wireless devices to advertise Atheros
specific capabilities.
Assigned CVE:
-------------
\* CVE-2007-5474
Details:
--------
\* The bug can be triggered by a malicious association request sent to
the wireless access point where one of the information elements must be
an Atheros information element with an inappropriate length (typically
too long). This can be achieved only after a successful 802.11
authentication (in "Open" or "Shared" mode according to the
configuration of the wireless access point).
Attack Impact:
--------------
\* Denial-of-service (reboot or hang-up) and possibly remote arbitrary
code execution
Attack Vector:
--------------
\* Unauthenticated wireless device
Timeline:
---------
\* 2007-10-22 - Vulnerability reported to Linksys
\* 2007-10-23 - Full details sent to Linksys
\* 2008-09-04 - Public disclosure
Affected Products:
------------------
\* Linksys WRT350N (firmware v2.00.17) with Atheros AR5416-AC1E chipset
Vulnerable Devices:
-------------------
\* As it is a wireless driver specific issue, the wireless vendor should
use the latest chipset wireless driver for their access point firmwares.
This security vulnerability was reported to Linksys, updated firmwares
should be available on their web site. Any other wireless device relying
on this vulnerable wireless driver is likely to be vulnerable.

from France Telecom / Orange
