Root cause of vulnerability:
The table's INDEX and DATA DIRECTORY were being taken directly from the table's first partition.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- The table's DATA and INDEX DIRECTORY settings were being inherited from the first partition, instead of being independent.
- This allowed a user with privileges on a database to create a partitioned table with DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY clauses pointing to a different database's directory.
- After removing partitioning, the table would then point to the directory of the other database, allowing the user to read and modify data of the other database, thus violating data isolation.

Impact of exploitation:
- A user with privileges on one database could gain access to data in other databases by creating a partitioned table, specifying a different directory for its partitions, then removing partitioning.
- This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, and potential data breaches across databases.

Attack vectors:
- A user with privileges to create tables in a database could use the CREATE TABLE statement with partitioning and DATA DIRECTORY/INDEX DIRECTORY clauses to point to another database's directory, then remove the partitioning.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to have privileges to create tables in at least one database.
- The attacker needs to know the file system path of the directory of the database that will be targeted.
