The user has to be convinced to open/view the crafted WPD file. The specific DLL and vulnerable function is wp6sr.dll that is parsing the WPD title, subject, and author fields which has a byte used as a counter which is multiplied by 256. By controlling this byte, an attacker can overflow a 2400-byte stack buffer. This allows an overwrite of the saved EIP and SEH for code execution"
