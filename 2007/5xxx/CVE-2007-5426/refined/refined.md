Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5426:

**Verification:**

The content from `securityvulns.ru` and `securityreason.com` directly reference CVE-2007-5426, associating it with a Cross-Site Scripting (XXS) vulnerability in ActiveKB NX 2.5.4. This matches the information in the provided content.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `page` parameter of ActiveKB NX 2.5.4. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code into the application.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Scripting (XXS). The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in dynamically generated web pages.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the `page` parameter in the URL. Specifically, the URL is `http://www.example.com/activekb/ActiveKB/?page=[XXS]`, where `[XXS]` would be the malicious payload.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing the malicious script and induce a user to visit the malicious URL. This can often be done through phishing emails or other forms of social engineering. The attacker does not need to have privileged access to the application itself.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary client-side script code into the affected application. This can have various impacts, such as:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies, potentially allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites, downloading malware onto users' systems.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the visual appearance of the site.
    *   **Information Theft:** Accessing sensitive information on the page or from the user's browser session.

**Additional Notes:**
* The `securityreason.com` content includes a digest of vulnerabilities reported by Russian-speaking authors to `securityvulns.ru`, listing CVE-2007-5426 alongside other vulnerabilities. This is a common way vulnerabilities are often grouped and reported.
* The `securityvulns.ru` content provides the specific detail that the XXS vulnerability is in ActiveKB NX 2.5.4, confirming the affected software and version. It also categorizes this issue as a remote attack, and also notes the risk as "High"

**Summary of Findings:**

The content indicates that CVE-2007-5426 is a Cross-Site Scripting (XXS) vulnerability in ActiveKB NX 2.5.4. Exploitation is possible through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code within the `page` parameter. The impact of successful exploitation includes session hijacking, malware distribution, website defacement, and information theft. This allows remote attacks.
