  "related": true,
  "summary": "A potential vulnerability was identified in the uploader class of XOOPS due to improper upload configurations by modules. A patch was released to address this issue.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the uploader class not being configured correctly by modules when handling file uploads. Specifically, when the file size is not set by the module, the `checkMaxFileSize()` method in the class returns true, incorrectly indicating that the upload was successful.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper file upload configuration",
      "Inadequate file size validation"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could allow users to upload files that exceed the intended size limitations, leading to potential resource exhaustion or other unexpected behavior. Additionally, the system could incorrectly report successful uploads when they have not occurred properly.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves uploading files through a module that does not correctly configure the uploader class.",
   "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a user capable of uploading files through a module with improper uploader configuration."
  },
    "affected_versions": "All XOOPS versions are potentially affected, although the patch was included in the 2.0.17.1 RC2 release."
