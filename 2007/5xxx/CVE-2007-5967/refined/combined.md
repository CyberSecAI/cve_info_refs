This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter

You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

mozilla/embedding/browser/gtk/src/EmbedCertificates.cpp
That code is built on my machine when I build Firefox for Linux.
I don't know under which circumstances that code is being used, but I'm scared, because it uses problematic defaults.
Whenever it encounters a CA cert for downloading, it will silently import it as "trusted for all purposes".
Whenever a web site triggers creation of a key pair in the browser, and asks for "escrow", the code will silently allow the software to hand the private key to the server.

It looks like this code landed with MICROB\_20061031\_BRANCH.
I don't think it's "dead code" in that it's meant to be used. I don't think any Mozilla.org products use it, however.

This should be a P1 blocker bug for whatever product uses this code, if any.
If any products are already running this code, they need an update ASAP,
and this needs to go into the CVE vulnerability tracking system, etc.
Silently accepting all downloaded certs as trusted means that a malicious
site can TRIVIALLY inject false root CA certs, and then conduct MASSIVE
MITM attacks on the user. Any ISP or Wireless HotSpot provider could
easily(!) do this.
So, Timeless, what products are using this code?

the more we look at this file, the more we are worried. Basically the class EmbedCertificates is stubbed out and not returning the right values in many cases.
We are thinking about removing this file from the build all together. Possibly commenting out
<http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/embedding/browser/gtk/src/EmbedPrivate.cpp#308> to line 349 or so?

timeless considers to modify NSS on their embedding device to use filename cert8a.db (instead of cert8.db) for the NSS cert db on their embedding device, in order to work around the problem that restores from backup might contain bad CA certs.

That rename is a bad idea. You will be stuck trying to make that work with future nss database upgrades. Since we know there's one on the horizon, it's a particularly bad idea.

i currently have an ongoing maintenance nightmare. suggestions welcome.
do i just decide to assume that this problem is academic and ignore everyone who has used the product for the past 6 months?
kaie mentioned perhaps setting a flag in each db, but as none of the people at nokia know anything about the database structure, writing such code would also be an ongoing maintenance nightmare (assuming we even manage to write something).
here are the cases for people to consider:
1. there aren't many ways to import user keys to the device, the best way i know of is to use firefox to import keys and then copy the files to the device
2. someone could have used a bad version of this product and received a CA cert which they shouldn't have.
3. the device has a backup/restore feature which basically zips certain files/directories (including the 2 db files affected here)
4. the device has two methods for updating files: they can be updated using a .deb or the device can be reflashed (after reflashing one is generally prompted to restore from the backup)
Now, the next version will no longer automatically import these certificates. but any certificate already imported will remain, or in the case of a backup will be restored.
Assuming there's anything I can do for 2, I suspect it'll break 1.
Adding a key value flag to the database would fix databases from 2 but make databases from 1 incompatible.
I'm not sure how much flexibility we have, but if we want a solution, we pretty much need it today.
otherwise we end up w/ a situation where there are three versions:
1. accepts all ca certs
2. doesn't accept ca certs, but has ca certs
3. a version that tries to clean out ca certs from 1 but not ca certs from 2.

4. Make the cert manager really work,
- showing imported certs, as well as built-in certs
- allowing user to delete and/or distrust them.

When the browser starts up, it must answer the following question:
"Have cert8.db, key3.db stored on disk been produced by
a compromised version of the browser?"
This is necessary, because on a fixed software environment,
users can restore a backup from before the fix.
Timeless had suggested the fixed software could use files with different names.
This would make sure the fixed software would never use old poisoned files.
But as Bob and Nelson are recommending against this option, we should drop it.
The next suggest came from me. My thinking was, instead of using different filenames, maybe a flag could been stored inside of the NSS database? Maybe, when the fixed software starts, it could check for a special value stored inside of the NSS db. When missing, the software could erase the NSS DB, let NSS create a fresh one, then add the magic indicating name=value pair to the database.
But I have no idea how easy this would be.
In addition, it would require changes to the NSS code, too.
I think we should drop this idea, too, because it's too complicated.
Here is idea number 3, and I think this is my best idea:
Use a separate "indicator file" as a flag "this database was produced using good software".
Here's a proposed algorithm:
- when the browser software starts up, really at the beginning of init (before any execution of NSS), check for the presence of a new file. Let's say /home/user/.mozilla/microb/.fixed\_bug\_406724
- when the file is missing, conclude the database came from a backup from before the fix. In that case, remove cert8.db and key3.db. Then create file .fixed\_bug\_406724 to indicate the future database will be clean.
- when the file is present, conclude the database is safe, and keep the files, do nothing
(FYI, a firmware flash will always remove all files stored in the device)

Kai, I think that's an alternative with much less ongoing maintenance
difficulties.
Another suggestion would be to use time stamps on the relevant files,
e.g. perhaps
if (certDB is older than the code fix) remove it.

I believe that won't work, for multiple reasons.
- one month after the fix became available, the user might still
run the older, broken firmware.
As a result the timestamp on the files will appear to look new,
although it still might be poisoned.
- the user might not care to set the real time on the device

I think you're saying "restore will not delete the new file".
If the user starts to use the browser, and afterwards runs a restore, you're right. In this scenario the indicator file will be present at the same time as the poisoned files from the restore.
I had assumed, users would always restore first, and would never run restore after having used the new OS.
You're right, it's possible that users might run restore at any time.
A better fix would involve the device's backup/restore software.
The restore mechanism could be changed to never restore db files from the old OS.
While we're being paranoid, I can think of one more scenario:
- user updates firmware
- user runs restore
- user does not use browser
- user creates a new backup
That new backup would be "created by new firmware version",
but would still contain the potentially bad db files.
So, the backup software would require one more decision:
"if the indicator file is missing, don't backup db files"

there's no way I'm hacking the backup software. I have no idea how much flexibility it has, but I think it's fairly safe to bet it doesn't have enough or that I wouldn't get it right.

Instead of using an external indicator file, you mentioned the proposal of using a pref that is stored in the browser prefs.js file. This sounds like a great idea, as both prefs.js and \*.db will always backed up and restored together.

yes, that was dolske's suggestion. which should work for all default cases (it doesn't work in any case where the user has custom scripts, but that's an edge case i'm willing to ignore).

Since a fix has been checked in can we close this bug? If there are remaining issues we should open a new bug that clarifies what work remains. With the total backout ([bug 408238](/show_bug.cgi?id=408238 "RESOLVED FIXED - back out unreviewed microb changes.")) having landed maybe there are no more remaining issues.
Did we ever figure out if anyone other than Nokia was using the trunk version of this code that we need to alert? Now that Nokia has made updated firmware available (in December I think) is it OK to release a security advisory on this now?Whiteboard: [sg:critical] gtk-embed only, not FF/Tbird/SM/Camino

(not marking wanted-next based on [comment 31](/show_bug.cgi?id=406724#c31 "RESOLVED FIXED - Problematic embedding code"), people should feel free to renom for blocking if they feel that this bug does)

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?
