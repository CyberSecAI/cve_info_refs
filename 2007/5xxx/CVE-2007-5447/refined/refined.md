{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ionCube loader extension for PHP versions 5.2.4 and earlier has a vulnerability that allows bypassing safe_mode and disable_functions restrictions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The ionCube extension's `ioncube_read_file` function does not properly respect the restrictions imposed by PHP's safe_mode and disable_functions settings."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can use `ioncube_read_file` to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, potentially exposing sensitive information such as source code, configuration files, and password files.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation by executing a PHP script using the vulnerable `ioncube_read_file` function."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute PHP code on the server. The PHP environment must have the ionCube Loader extension installed and have safe_mode enabled with `ioncube_read_file` included in `disable_functions` setting"
  }
