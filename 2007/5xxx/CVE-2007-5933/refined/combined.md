# Pioneers: Multiple Denials of Service — GLSA **200711-20**

Two Denial of Service vulnerabilities were discovered in Pioneers.

### Affected packages

| Package | **games-board/pioneers** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.11.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.11.3-r1** |

### Background

Pioneers (formerly gnocatan) is a clone of the popular board game "The
Settlers of Catan".

### Description

Roland Clobus discovered that the Pioneers server may free sessions
objects while they are still in use, resulting in access to invalid
memory zones (CVE-2007-5933). Bas Wijnen discovered an error when
closing connections which can lead to a failed assertion
(CVE-2007-6010).

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially crafted data to the vulnerable
server, resulting in a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Pioneers users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=games-board/pioneers-0.11.3-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package: pioneers
Version: 0.11.2-2
Severity: normal
Tags: security, fixed-upstream, patch

By sending special codes to the pioneers server, it can be made to
crash.  The game that was in progress is lost when this happens.
It is not possible to execute code using this bug.

The patch for this problem is here:
<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1791176&group_id=5095&atid=305095>

It is already applied in the new upstream release, 0.11.3, which I shall
package soon.

Security team: please let me know if I can/should do anything to get
this patch into stable.  I think it should apply directly to the stable
package without problems (but I didn't test that yet).

Thanks,
Bas

thanks

A bug which caused a segmentation fault was fixed, however it is still
possible to crash the server remotely, this time by triggering an
assert.  Therefore I am reopening this bug.

Thanks,
Bas

I'm not really sure what triggers it.  Bug #1786686 on sourceforge has
some more info, but none of it is really certain.

Hi,

As I wrote before, there was a DoS vulnerability in Pioneers.  While
testing if it also occurred in stable, I found a second problem, which
is now also fixed.  The fix is uploaded to unstable, and should enter
testing in 2 days.  The attached patch fixes both problems in stable.
To use it:

cd /tmp
dget -x ftp://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/pool/main/p/pioneers/pioneers_0.10.2-3.dsc
cd pioneers-0.10.2
patch -p2 < /path/to/patch
dch -i
debuild

The problem is documented on
<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1786686&group_id=5095&atid=105095>
This patch is a combination of the following two patches:
<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1791176&group_id=5095&atid=305095>
<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1833003&group_id=5095&atid=305095>

If you need any more help, let me know.

Thanks,
Bas

Thanks for providing an update, but since we have a wide range of more
important security issues to address it is very unlikely we'll be able
to release an update for crash bugs in a game server, since there
will almost always be new and more grave issues on the plate.

I'd recommend to update this through a stable point update instead.

Cheers,
        Moritz

| [Description](#c0)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-11 14:07:19 UTC  ``` Bas Wijnen has reported a vulnerability in Pioneers, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).  The vulnerability is caused due to a session object being deleted while still in use. This can be exploited to crash the Pioneers server by sending specially crafted data.  The vulnerability is reported in versions prior to 0.11.3.  SOLUTION: Update to version 0.11.3. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-11 14:08:41 UTC  ``` games, version 0.11.3 is in the tree but ~arch, is it ready for stabilization? please advise. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Mr. Bones. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-11 14:43:21 UTC  ``` stablized and removed all but 0.11.3 ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-11 14:59:08 UTC  ``` ok, so we can directly proceed to glsa vote. I tend to vote YES. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-11 15:00:26 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=198807#c2)) > stablized and removed all but 0.11.3  Should we call in x86, because 0.11.3 is only ~x86 right now? ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Mr. Bones. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-11 15:13:06 UTC  ``` missed it.  fixed it now. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-11 15:19:22 UTC  ``` Thanks.  Voting YES since it seems unauthenticated users can crash the server. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-11 15:28:58 UTC  ``` request filed. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-14 22:12:13 UTC  ``` GLSA 200711-20 ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-18 12:14:01 UTC  ``` It seems we only fixed one of the two DoS vulnerabilities discovered.  From <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=449541>  As I wrote before, there was a DoS vulnerability in Pioneers.  While testing if it also occurred in stable, I found a second problem, which is now also fixed.  The fix is uploaded to unstable, and should enter testing in 2 days.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
