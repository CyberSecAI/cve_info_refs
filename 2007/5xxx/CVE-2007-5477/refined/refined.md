- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `auth.w` script in WebMod 0.48 uses a custom language "W" where commands are enclosed in `{}`, and it directly incorporates user-supplied input from GET requests (specifically, the `redir` parameter) into the `action` attribute of a form tag without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The unsanitized user-controlled input in the `redir` parameter allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the HTML.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser when they load the vulnerable page. This can lead to various attacks like session hijacking, defacement, redirecting users to malicious sites, or stealing sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes the malicious JavaScript payload within the `redir` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious payload, and the user needs to be tricked into visiting that crafted URL.
