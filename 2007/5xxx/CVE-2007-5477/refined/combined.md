Seems to be related to a post by "nemessis" at
<http://sla.ckers.org/forum/read.php?3,44,11482#msg-11482>

Seems to be live on some servers based on Google search results.

source: <http://djeyl.net/files.php#webmod>

auth.w appears to utilize a custom or non-typical programming language
mixed with HTML, probably called W, without any apparent documentation
in the WebMod package.  Commands are encoded within "{}"

The relevant line is:

  <form action="auth.w?redir={G.redir}" method="post" name="authform">

where, from context in other source code, "G" is an
array/hash/structure that contains values from GET requests.
