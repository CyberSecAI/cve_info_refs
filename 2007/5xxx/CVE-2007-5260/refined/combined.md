ASP-CMS version 1 default password location.
http://asp-cms.sourceforge.net/
A vulnerability exists within the content management system ASP-CMS that allows a remote user to see the username and password of
the content management system itsself. the user/pass combo along with all the other settings of the application are stored in an
MDB file in the folder mdb-database.
Attackers can input the following into an affected site:
http://www.example.com/asp-cms/mdb-database/ASP-CMS\_v100.mdb
The fix would be to add place the file somewhere else on the filesystem out of reach of the http area.
