    "ID": "CVE-2007-5230",
    "Source": "www.exploit-db.com_e5500864_20250125_230353.html",
    "Root cause": "The /admin/upload_files.php script does not check if the user is an admin before allowing access. It also fails to validate file extensions, only checking MIME types, allowing the upload of arbitrary files, including PHP scripts.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing authentication check for admin access to upload_files.php.",
      "Inadequate file extension validation."
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary file upload, leading to potential remote code execution by uploading and executing malicious PHP scripts.",
    "Attack vectors": "Direct access to the /admin/upload_files.php script via HTTP POST request, bypassing intended admin panel access.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They do not need to be authenticated or have administrative privileges initially."
  }
