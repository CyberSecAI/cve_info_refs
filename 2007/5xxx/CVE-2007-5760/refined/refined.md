  "CVE-2007-5760": {
    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the X.Org X server and Xfont library, allowing for a local privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution. The XFree86-Misc extension does not properly sanitize a parameter within a PassMessage request, allowing the modification of a function pointer.",
    "Root cause": "The XFree86-Misc extension in the X.Org X server does not properly sanitize a parameter within a PassMessage request.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds array index in XFree86-Misc extension",
        "Modification of a function pointer"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution. Remote attackers could exploit the vulnerability in the Xfont library by enticing a user to load a specially crafted PCF font file resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the X server, typically root. If the X server allows connections from the network, these vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted X server extension requests.",
        "Specially crafted PCF font file",
	"Network connections to X server"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Local access to the X server or a network connection to a vulnerable X server instance.",
	"Additional Information": "This CVE is associated with multiple other CVEs including CVE-2007-5958, CVE-2007-6427, CVE-2007-6428, CVE-2007-6429, and CVE-2008-0006. These vulnerabilities are found in various X server extensions and the Xfont library. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, and information disclosure."
