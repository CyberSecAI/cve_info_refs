Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-5602:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow present in the SwiftView ActiveX control (svocx.ocx) and Netscape-style plugin (npsview.dll).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:**  The core issue is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the SwiftView components, which can be exploited to overwrite data on the stack, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker's code will run with the privileges of the user who is viewing the malicious content, leading to privilege escalation if the user has administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTML Document:** The primary attack vector involves convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document. This can be achieved through:
    *   Malicious Web Pages: The attacker could host a malicious webpage containing the exploit.
    *   HTML Emails/Attachments: The attacker could send an HTML email or attachment that, when opened, triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:**  The attacker can be remote and does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to interact with the crafted malicious HTML content (e.g. visiting a web page or opening an HTML email).

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Software:** SwiftView and SwiftSend software that includes the vulnerable ActiveX control and plugin
*   **Affected components:** svocx.ocx (ActiveX control), npsview.dll (Netscape plugin)
*   **Vendor Solution:** The vulnerability is addressed in SwiftView and SwiftSend version 8.3.5.
