## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1412-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
November 24, 2007                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : ruby1.9
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : local/remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-5162 CVE-2007-5770

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ruby, an object-oriented
scripting language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-5162

    It was discovered that the Ruby HTTP(S) module performs insufficient
    validation of SSL certificates, which may lead to man-in-the-middle
    attacks.

CVE-2007-5770

    It was discovered that the Ruby modules for FTP, Telnet, IMAP, POP
    and SMTP perform insufficient validation of SSL certificates, which
    may lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0+20060609-1etch1. Updated packages for hppa and sparc will
be provided later.

The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain ruby1.9 packages.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.9 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian (stable)
- ---------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

# USN-596-1: Ruby vulnerabilities

26 March 2008

Ruby vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [ruby1.8](/security/cves?package=ruby1.8) -

## Details

Chris Clark discovered that Ruby's HTTPS module did not check for

commonName mismatches early enough during SSL negotiation. If a remote

attacker were able to perform machine-in-the-middle attacks, this flaw could

be exploited to view sensitive information in HTTPS requests coming from

Ruby applications. ([CVE-2007-5162](/security/CVE-2007-5162))

It was discovered that Ruby's FTPTLS, telnets, and IMAPS modules

did not check the commonName when performing SSL certificate checks.

If a remote attacker were able to perform machine-in-the-middle attacks,

this flaw could be exploited to eavesdrop on encrypted communications

from Ruby applications using these protocols. ([CVE-2007-5770](/security/CVE-2007-5770))

iSEC Partners Security Advisory - 2007-006-RubySSL
http://www.isecpartners.com
--------------------------------------------
Ruby Net::HTTPS library does not validate server certificate CN
Vendor: Ruby
Vendor URL: http://www.ruby-lang.org
Versions affected: 1.8.5, 1.8.6, Trunk Ruby
Systems Affected: All Ruby Platforms
Severity: Medium - Compromise of SSL connection integrity
Author: Chris Clark <cclark[at]isecpartners[dot]com>
Vendor notified: Yes
Public release: Yes
Advisory URL: http://www.isecpartners.com/advisories/2007-006-rubyssl.txt
Summary:
--------
The Ruby Net::HTTP and Net::HTTPS library can be used to make HTTP or HTTPS
connections to remote websites. There are several methods for performing these
types of connections within the Ruby standard library but the Net::HTTP library
is recommended going forward.
A vulnerability results from the Net::HTTPS library failing to validate the name
on the SSL certificate agains the DNS name requested by the user. By not
validating the name, the library allows an attacker to present a
cryptographically valid certificate with an invalid CN.
Details:
--------
The vulnerability is caused by the method connect within http.rb file failing to
call post\_connection\_check after the SSL connection has been negotiated. Since
the server certificates CN is not validated against the requested DNS name,
the attacker can impersonate the target server in a SSL connection. The
integrity and confidentiality benefits of SSL are removed by this vulnerability.
Example:
If the application uses the following code to connect to the ip address of
https://www.citicards.com:
url = "192.193.222.24" #www.citicards.com IP
path = "/"
http = Net::HTTP.new(url, 443)
http.use\_ssl = true
http.ca\_file = "verisign.pem"
http.verify\_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY\_PEER
resp, data = http.get(path, nil)
The connection will succeed. This is an obvious failure as the certificate
presented has a CN of www.citicards.com. One caveat is that the attacker must
possess a certificate signed by the CA specified in the ca\_file attribute.
Fix Information:
----------------
This issue has been addressed by adding the appropriate post connection check
within http.rb. These patches add the enable\_post\_connection parameter, which
if set to true, will cause the Net::HTTP library to raise an exception when the
post connection check fails.
The following trunk Ruby checkin contains the related changes:
http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi?view=rev&revision=13499

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1411-1                  security@debian.org

Package        : libopenssl-ruby
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : local/remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-5162 CVE-2007-5770

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ruby, an object-oriented
scripting language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-5162

    It was discovered that the Ruby HTTP(S) module performs insufficient
    validation of SSL certificates, which may lead to man-in-the-middle
    attacks.

CVE-2007-5770

    It was discovered that the Ruby modules for FTP, Telnet, IMAP, POP
    and SMTP perform insufficient validation of SSL certificates, which
    may lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.

The stable distribution (etch) no longer contains libopenssl-ruby.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.1.4a-1sarge1. Packages for sparc will be provided later.

We recommend that you upgrade your libopenssl-ruby packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian 3.1 (oldstable)
- ----------------------

Oldstable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

    It was discovered that the Ruby modules for FTP, Telnet, IMAP, POP
    and SMTP perform insufficient validation of SSL certificates, which
    may lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.5-4etch1. Packages for sparc will be provided later.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.8.2-7sarge6. Packages for sparc will be provided later.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.8 packages.
