| [Description](#c0)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-07 17:08:24 UTC  ``` Another log injection issue in denyhosts. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-28 09:33:28 UTC  ``` Adding netmon herd. This is a whole SSH DoS issue. The initial fix seems incomplete, i sent you an email. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Benjamin Smee (strerror) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-28 12:01:47 UTC  ``` Waiting on reply from upstream.  From my perspective this is an upstream issue. If I'm getting to the stage where I have to maintain a patchset from the main codebase then I'd rather just yank it from the tree as I'm not interested in maintaining security patches for what is after all meant to be a security tool. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-28 12:21:42 UTC  ``` thanks for your reply, let's hope that upstream will fix this, otherwise we will have to mask this package.  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-28 18:06:49 UTC  ``` I think we should yank it, even if he does fix it, local users can still attack it with logger. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-07-16 14:58:57 UTC  ``` Benjamin, any news from upstream? ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Peter Volkov (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-13 15:13:55 UTC  ``` I agree that this is upstream issue. But while we are waiting for news from UPSTREAM I've bumped ebuild with the fixes from redhat: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=237449> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=244943> It should address this log injection.  Now I'm not sure what best shall we do, stabilize or mask. Taking short look at forums I'd say that users use it and it's better to keep. But personally I do not use this tool so I'd like somebody else to take this decision.  ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-24 16:22:31 UTC  ``` I think we should mask this one. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-24 18:08:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=181213#c7)) > I think we should mask this one.  Why? Masking doesn't make anything easier for us than stabling this.  It should be the maintainer's decision to Last-Rite and not that of Security once a security issue is fixed. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-24 18:18:36 UTC  ``` @rbu It was just my personal opinion.  Arches please test and mark stable. Target keywords are:  denyhosts-2.6-r1.ebuild:KEYWORDS="alpha amd64 hppa ~ppc sparc x86" ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Christian Faulhammer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-24 18:25:49 UTC  ``` x86 stable ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Jeroen Roovers (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-25 00:26:06 UTC  ``` Stable for HPPA. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Raúl Porcel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-25 14:28:27 UTC  ``` alpha/sparc stable ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Philippe Chaintreuil    2007-09-26 17:11:31 UTC  ``` By the way, I just wanted to throw in my two cents as a user of this package.  I find it a helpful and useful program, and would be very sad if it was removed from the tree.  It is a little sad that UPSTREAM seems to be losing interest in this program.  He's getting slower and slower about fixing/improving things.  But I'd rather have this program than not have it.  Additionally I appreciate the maintainers of this ebuild for keeping it patched & working when it matters -- especially when UPSTREAM is slow/appears dead.   > local users can still attack it with logger.  I trust my local users -- that's why they have accounts.  I don't trust people trying to break into my machine from the internet -- that's why I use this program.  <rant> I know, I know.... layers of security ... an onion....  But that's hog-wash if I don't have a defense from random people running scripts against my box from all over the world at all hours of the day.  At least if a local user starts doing something strange, I know where they live and can go smack them upside the head.  Plane tickets to China are too expensive. </rant> ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-29 00:59:20 UTC  ``` This is CVE-2007-4323. ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Steve Dibb (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-29 02:19:03 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-29 09:00:19 UTC  ``` B3 -> [glsa?]  Please vote. ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-02 21:21:21 UTC  ``` it can block SSH connections from everywhere. I vote yes. ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-06 13:32:19 UTC  ``` voting yes too, request filed. ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-13 12:11:02 UTC  ``` GLSA 200710-14, sorry for the delay. ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=237449#c0)  Jonathan Underwood    2007-04-23 10:07:41 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  I have "PermitRootLogin no" in sshd_config to prevent logins as username root. I also only allow specific usernames to log in, so I have AllowUsers set in sshd_config.  When someone does attempt to login as root, I see this in /var/log/secure:  Apr 23 07:03:53 machinename sshd[29961]: User root from 122.36.2.10 not allowed because not listed in AllowUsers  and the corresponding entry in /var/log/denyhosts  2007-04-23 07:04:07,805 - denyhosts   : ERROR    regex pattern ( User (?P<user>. *) not allowed because not listed in AllowUsers ) is missing 'host' group  ... and the attacker goes unblocked and undetected by denyhosts.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): denyhosts-2.6-2.fc6 openssh-clients-4.3p2-19.fc6 openssh-4.3p2-19.fc6 openssh-server-4.3p2-19.fc6 openssh-askpass-4.3p2-19.fc6   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=237449#c1)  Jason Tibbitts    2007-04-23 14:39:19 UTC  ``` Do you have any configuration entries defined which match REGEX?  If not, I believe this is a known upstream bug.  My understanding, however, is that it is harmless; ssh doesn't provide a hostname in that message so there is no way to extract a hostname to block from it, and the message you see in your logs is informing you of that.  I am not sure that ssh actually provides the messages necessary to do what you are attempting to do, although please include it if so.  Otherwise I don't see that the underlying problem is something that can be solved with denyhosts.  [http://www.mail-archive.com/denyhosts-user@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00132.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/denyhosts-user%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg00132.html)  Note also that there was no upstream response to this; in fact, upstream seems to have gone dormant.  If you have other suggestions on how we could make minor modifications to the denyhosts packaging to accommodate this, I'm happy to hear them.  But my feeling now is that in the absense of additional messages from openssh which aren't being considered, this is not a denyhosts bug.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=237449#c2)  Jonathan Underwood    2007-04-23 15:33:32 UTC  ``` If you look at the openssh log message provided above, you'll see the IP of the offending host, and so there is sufficient information - denyhosts blocks by IP rather than hostname. So, I believe denyhosts should block that host, and this is a fairly severe bug.  Looking a bit harder into it, I think (as suggested by your mail to the user-list) that in file  /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/DenyHosts/regex.py  FAILED_ENTRY_REGEX7 = re.compile(r"""User (?P<user>.*) not allowed because not listed in AllowUsers""")  should be replaced with  FAILED_ENTRY_REGEX7 = re.compile(r"""User (?P<user>.*) .*from (::ffff:)?(?P<host>\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}) not allowed because not listed in AllowUsers""")  I'll test this locally, but that seems to be the crux of it - REGEX7 contains no pattern to match the host.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=237449#c3)  Jonathan Underwood    2007-04-23 16:20:05 UTC  ``` Have confirmed that fix works by placing the following line in denyhosts.conf  FAILED_ENTRY_REGEX7 = User (?P<user>.*) .*from (::ffff:)?(?P<host>\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}) not allowed because not listed in AllowUsers  [All one line, not wrapped]  And so my suggestion of the replacement line in [Comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=237449#c2) for /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/DenyHosts/regex.py is the correct fix.  Will attach a patch.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=237449#c4)  Jason Tibbitts    2007-04-23 16:22:43 UTC  ``` Any clue as to what this looks like for an IPv6 denial?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=237449#c5)  Jonathan Underwood    2007-04-23 16:25:48 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 153291](attachment.cgi?id=153291&action=diff "Fix REGEX7") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=153291&action=edit "Fix REGEX7") Fix REGEX7   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=237449#c6)  Jonathan Underwood    2007-04-23 16:28:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=237449#c4)) > Any clue as to what this looks like for an IPv6 denial?  Um, no. Seems irrelevant though, this fix is as IPV6 safe as the rest of DenyHosts - basically it brings REGEX7 into alignment with the other REGEXs - if this is broken for IPV6, then all the others are too. I don't have any way to test this I'm afraid.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=237449#c7)  Jason Tibbitts    2007-04-23 16:36:49 UTC  ``` OK, let me do a build and see if I can get this past releng for F7.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=237449#c8)  Jonathan Underwood    2007-04-23 16:41:55 UTC  ``` OK, thanks. An update for FC6 would also be much appreciated.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=237449#c9)  Jason Tibbitts    2007-04-24 22:21:33 UTC  ``` I did some testing and let the new version stew on my servers overnight.  Since that went OK, I pushed and built for F7, FC6, FC5, EL5 and EL4.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=237449#c10)  Jonathan Underwood    2007-04-25 10:15:39 UTC  ``` Splendid, thanks.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=237449#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2007-10-31 13:20:30 UTC  ``` CVE id [CVE-2007-5715](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-5715) was assigned to this old issue.   ``` |  |
