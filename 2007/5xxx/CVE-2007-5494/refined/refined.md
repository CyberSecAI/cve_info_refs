{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A memory leak exists in the Tux HTTP accelerator patch within the Linux kernel.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `open(O_ATOMICLOOKUP)` function call in the kernel doesn't properly release the dentry (directory entry) when `d_revalidate` fails due to the `O_ATOMICLOOKUP` flag.",
      "Specifically, the patch's `need_revalidate` function, when encountering the `atomic` flag, returns `-EWOULDBLOCKIO` without dropping the dentry, leading to a dentry leak."
    ],
    "impact": "A local user can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (DoS) by exhausting system memory. This is done by repeatedly calling `open(O_ATOMICLOOKUP)` on a file.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access is required."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker must have the ability to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.",
      "The attacker needs to be able to repeatedly call the `open` system call with the `O_ATOMICLOOKUP` flag."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects filesystems where `d_revalidate` is implemented. Repeated calls to open with O_RDONLY and O_RDONLY | 02000000 will leak dentries."
