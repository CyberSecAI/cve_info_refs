        "vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Sun Java, including one related to DNS rebinding attacks. Specifically, Java applets or JavaScript programs running within browsers do not pin DNS hostnames to a single IP address, allowing for DNS rebinding attacks.",

          "DNS rebinding vulnerability"
        ],
        "impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted applet on a website or start an application in Java Web Start to execute arbitrary code outside of the Java sandbox and of the Java security restrictions with the privileges of the user running Java. The attacker could also obtain sensitive information, create, modify, rename and read local files, execute local applications, establish connections in the local network, bypass the same origin policy, and cause a Denial of Service via multiple vectors.",
         "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to run a specially crafted applet on a website.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and entice a user to visit it and execute a specially crafted applet or JavaScript program."
