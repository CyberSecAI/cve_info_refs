Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the `include` and `require_once` functions in PHP scripts within the 'der-dirigent' project, where the path to the included file is constructed using a variable (`$dedi_path` or `$this_dir`) without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to potentially control the file path being included, leading to RFI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include remote files by manipulating the `$dedi_path` or `$this_dir` variables used in the `include`, `include_once`, or `require_once` functions.
* **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not validate or sanitize the path variables, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary URLs.
* **Use of Variables for Path Construction:** Building paths using variables that are not strictly controlled creates an avenue for exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application.
* **Data Disclosure:** The attacker could also potentially include files that expose sensitive information from the server.
* **Website Defacement:** The attacker can modify the website's content to deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Manipulating `$dedi_path` or `$this_dir` variables:** The attacker would need to control the value of the `$dedi_path` or `$this_dir` variables before they are used in include or require functions.
* **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker would likely achieve this by manipulating parameters within HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
* **Remote File Inclusion:** The attack involves forcing the server to include and execute a file from a remote, attacker-controlled location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
* **Understanding of Application Logic:** The attacker needs some knowledge of how the application handles requests and how the include paths are generated, to inject the malicious URL in a relevant parameter that controls `$dedi_path` or `$this_dir`.

**Specific Vulnerable Code Locations:**
The content identifies the following files and lines as vulnerable:
* `tmp/der_dirigent_v1.0/backend/inc/inc.generate_code.php`: Line 7
* `tmp/der_dirigent_v1.0/projekt01/cms/inc/frontend.php`: Line 159
* `tmp/der_dirigent_v1.0/projekt01/cms/inc/backend.php`: Line 5
* `tmp/der_dirigent_v1.0/backend/inc/fnc.type_forms.php`: Line 7
* `tmp/der_dirigent_v1.0/backend/inc/fnc.type.php`: Line 24
* `tmp/der_dirigent_v1.0/backend/inc/class.filemanager.php`: Line 81

The specific code snippets are all variations of `include($dedi_path.’inc/somefile.php’);` or `require_once ($this_dir.’inc/somefile.php’);`, highlighting the vulnerability's pattern.
