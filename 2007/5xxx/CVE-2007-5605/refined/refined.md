  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2007-5605": {
      "details": "HP Online Support Services contains the function GetFileTime(), which can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow. This may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.",
       "root_cause": "The HPISDataManager.dll ActiveX control contains an insecure function GetFileTime()",
      "weaknesses": [

      "impact": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.",
      "attack_vectors": "By convincing a user to visit a malicious web page, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker.",
      "additional_notes": "The HP Support Services ActiveX control is locked to certain domains, such as hp.com. This means that an attacker would have to subvert the host name lookup methodology on a victim's system or exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability in one of the allowed domains to exploit this vulnerability."
