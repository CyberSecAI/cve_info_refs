| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=327854#c0)  Marcus Rückert   2007-09-24 16:20:56 UTC  ``` ----- Forwarded message from Joerg Sonnenberger <joerg@britannica.bec.de> -----  Date: Fri, 21 Sep 2007 23:28:43 +0200 From: Joerg Sonnenberger <joerg@britannica.bec.de> To: xorg_security@x.org Subject: Off-by-one in libXfont-1.3.1  Hi, the update from libXfont-1.3.0 to 1.3.1 changed catalogue.c to NUL-terminate the buffer passed to readlink. This is not correct if readlink writes exactly sizeof dest bytes as it writes exactly one byte after the limit. The old code was not vulnerable as it copied to a newly allocated buffer of the right size.  This code should be somewhat reorganised to use asprintf/snprintf and making it a lot more readable, but that is a visual matter independent of the actual issue.
