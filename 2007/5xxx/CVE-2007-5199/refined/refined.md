CVE-2007-5199: Off-by-one error in libXfont 1.3.1

- Root Cause: When reading a symbolic link using `readlink`, the code in `catalogue.c` in libXfont-1.3.1 did not account for the null termination. If `readlink` wrote exactly `sizeof dest` bytes, the subsequent null termination `dest[len] = '\0'` would write one byte beyond the allocated buffer.
- Vulnerability: Off-by-one buffer overflow
- Attack vector: A user can trigger this vulnerability by using `xset +fp` to add a font path that contains a symbolic link with a name of maximum length (MAXFONTFILENAMELEN = 1024).
- Impact: Writing beyond the buffer limit, potentially leading to a crash or other undefined behavior.
- Affected versions: libXfont 1.3.1
- Fix: The patch modifies the `readlink` call to read at most `sizeof dest - 1` bytes, ensuring space for the null terminator. `len = readlink(link, dest, sizeof dest - 1);`
