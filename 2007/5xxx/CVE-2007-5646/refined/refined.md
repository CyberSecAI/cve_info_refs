  "CVE-2007-5646": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Two SQL injection flaws in Simple Machines Forum (SMF) 1.1.3.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Blind SQL injection vulnerabilities. The application's SQL injection filter can be bypassed.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can extract sensitive data such as password hashes. An attacker can also install a backdoor on the server via 'into outfile'.",
      "Attack vectors": "HTTP requests to the target application.",
	  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required for the non-cookie based attack, while a valid cookie is required for the other attack vector which allows a faster exploitation."
