SMF is a very hardened php application. If anyone wants an example of some interesting PHP security SMF is a good place to look. Even after being able to injection SQL I had to take another step and bypass some difficult filters found in the db\_query() function. Ultimately i was able to do so.
This exploit is using blind sql injection. although you might not believe it on how fast it is. It can take less than 20 seconds to obtain a 40byte hash on a remote server!
Be safe,

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[Simple Machines Forum 1.1.4 and 1.0.12 released](https://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?msg=1250330)

[September 23, 2007, 05:02:50 PM](https://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?msg=1250330 "Simple Machines Forum 1.1.4 and 1.0.12 released ")

Last Edit: September 24, 2007, 10:33:11 PM by Compuart

Simple Machines is proud to announce the release of SMF 1.1.4.

This release mainly addresses some security issues and fixes a few small bugs.

We urge all users to upgrade to SMF 1.1.4 as soon as possible to take advantage of these fixes. A summary of the fixes is as follows:

 \* Inline modification of a board which had moderators was not working correctly.
 \* Stop CDATA blocks breaking preview/quick modify.
 \* Allow users to log out in maintenance mode.
 \* Check GET and POST instead of REQUEST for numeric keys.
 \* Fixed editing grace period inconsistancies within the post script.
 \* Some input values didn't get escaped properly - reported by Michael Brooks.
 \* Some attachment filenames didn't get escaped properly.
 \* Function for fixing list and table tags wasn't working as expected.

For users currently running SMF 1.1.3, upgrading could not be easier. Simply log into your forum and visit your admin center - a notice should inform you an update is available. Follow the instructions to patch your release - this should not generally affect any modifications, language packs or themes you have installed. Alternatively download the attached patch file, upload to your "Packages" directory and visit the package manager to install this fix.

If you cannot upgrade using the package manager, please follow the instructions posted in the Online Manual about installing and upgrading.

For users currently running SMF 1.0.11, a separate version has been released: 1.0.12. Just like the 1.1.x branch users, you can simply upgrade through the admin center or download and apply the attached patch.

The same goes for charter members currently running SMF 2.0 beta 1. They can upgrade to SMF 2.0 beta 1.1 through the admin center or by downloading and applying the attached patch.

Finally - please do not use this topic for any support requests. You will get a much more prompt response by visiting the relevant support board!

Thanks,

Simple Machines

Thanks for posting this.  I wish it was connected to my Admin panel, so I could had been alerted yesterday.  I got my site unsuspended and I'm going to update my forum.

It didn't.

It was just released like, now.

Compuart's post came from inside the team boards and was split out.

the packages/installed.list file must of been written too 3 times. You can manually edit this file and remove two of those lines if you wish. Deleting the package would only remove one of the lines.
