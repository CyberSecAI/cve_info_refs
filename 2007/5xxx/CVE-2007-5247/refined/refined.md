Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a format string bug present in the Lithtech engine, the game engine used by F.E.A.R. This bug has been publicly known since 2004.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The game engine improperly handles format strings, allowing an attacker to inject format specifiers within data that is later processed by functions such as `printf`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server. The provided CVSS score indicates a high risk with complete confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts.
- **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to full control over the game server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted UDP packets.
- **Punkbuster as a Vehicle:** Although the bug is in the Lithtech engine, Punkbuster (an anti-cheat program) is used to trigger the vulnerability. When Punkbuster is enabled, it displays the content of certain incoming packets (PB_Y and PB_U packets) in the server's console. Attackers can inject malicious format strings into these packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the targeted server.
- **Knowledge of Game Protocol:** The attacker needs to know how to craft the malicious PB_Y and PB_U packets and insert the format string payload.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack can be performed without any prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in F.E.A.R. versions 1.08 and earlier.
- A proof-of-concept exploit was made available (`fearfspb.zip`).
- The vulnerability was not patched despite being known for a long time.
- The attack is anonymous from the outside of the server since it is done using one UDP packet.

This detailed information provides a good understanding of the format string vulnerability and its exploitation in F.E.A.R.
