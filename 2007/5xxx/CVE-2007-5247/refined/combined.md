1) Introduction

F.E.A.R. is the most recent FPS game developed by Monolith
(http://www.lith.com).
#######################################################################
======
2) Bug
======
This bug is nothing new moreover considering that it's public from the
far 2004 when this game was still a beta:
http://aluigi.org/adv/lithfs-adv.txt
What changes this time is the type of exploitation and the derived
advantages since now the attack is completely anonymous from outside
the server using only one UDP packet.
When Punkbuster is enabled on a server (true for many public servers)
it visualizes the content of some incoming packets using the game's
console.
The Punkbuster packets needed for forcing the visualization of a custom
string in the console are PB\_Y (YPG server) and PB\_U (UCON), while in
the past was ok to use PB\_P too which has been recently made no longer
verbose probably due to its abusing attempted by people for spamming
servers (which is naturally still possible with the above packets).
As already said this is a bug in the Lithtech engine and NOT in
Punkbuster which is used only as a "way" for exploiting it.

No fix.
The bug has been never "really" patched although it's public from 3
years.
