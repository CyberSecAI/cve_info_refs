{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input sanitization in the `check_http` plugin when following HTTP redirects, and a failure to reset pointers in `sslutils.c`. Additionally, improper memory reallocation when following redirection requests.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer Overflow in `check_http` when parsing HTTP Location headers.",
    "Denial of service vulnerability in `sslutils.c` due to missing pointer reset.",
    "Denial of service due to improper memory reallocation in `check_http`."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious remote web server could cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code as the user running Nagios.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Sending a crafted HTTP Location header in a redirect response to a Nagios `check_http` plugin.",
    "Sending a malicious response to `sslutils.c`",
     "Sending multiple redirects to trigger a memory reallocation issue in `check_http`."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control a web server that is being monitored by Nagios or be able to man-in-the-middle the communication between the nagios server and monitored host. For the memory reallocation and `sslutils.c` vulnerabilities, they only need to respond to the nagios server"
