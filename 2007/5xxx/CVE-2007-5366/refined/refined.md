{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to an error page returned by the Tomcat 4.1-based Servlet Service, which includes the root path of the web application (physical path about the document root).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Web root path disclosure vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can potentially obtain the physical path of the web application's document root by viewing the error page, which can aid in further attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can trigger an error that reveals the web root path.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send requests that generate an error, potentially through normal web application interactions. The attacker is remote, thus no specific local access is required."
