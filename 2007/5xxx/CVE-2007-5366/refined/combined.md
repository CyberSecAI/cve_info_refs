###

---

[Notes on using this web page](/global/support/software/security/about.html)

## 1. Background and Detected problem(s)

There is a possibility being returned the error page which contains the root path of the Web application (physical path about the document root) to the remote attackers.

## 2. Method to avoid the problem

Add following JavaVM option(Note1) by setting the IJServer work unit.

  -Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=false

  Note1)Set in the following input forms.

* Interstage Management Console  -&gt;

* [WorkUnit(IJServer) Name]  -&gt;
* Settings  -&gt;
* WorkUnit Settings  -&gt;
* Java VM Options

Fujitsu has confirmed this vulnerability as a problem of the Tomcat 4.1-based Servlet Service. However, because it was a problem concerning the JavaVM option, this problem is scheduled to be corrected in a future version of the Interstage Application Server.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
