Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5983:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `AutoIndex` application. This affects both cross-site scripting (XSS) and denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities.
    *   Specifically, `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` is not sanitized, leading to XSS.
    *   Unsanitized user input is used in the recursive size calculation of directories, leading to DoS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The application fails to sanitize user-provided input when handling  `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will execute in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS)**:  The application uses unsanitized user input within the function that calculates directory size. This can be exploited to create a condition where the system will consume excessive CPU time and memory, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, which can then be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the website.
*   **DoS:** An attacker can cause the server to become unresponsive or crash by exhausting its resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** By crafting a URL that injects malicious code into the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts.
*   **DoS:** By providing a specially crafted input such as `%00` to the `dir` parameter, the attacker can trigger an error in the recursive calculation of directory size, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable `AutoIndex` application.
*   The attacker does not need any special authentication or privileges to execute the attacks.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered in `AutoIndex` versions `2.2.2` and earlier.
*   Patches were released by the vendor:
    *   Version `2.2.3` addressed the XSS vulnerability.
    *   Version `2.2.4` addressed the DoS vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on 2007-11-12
*   The XSS vulnerability is associated with CWE-79
