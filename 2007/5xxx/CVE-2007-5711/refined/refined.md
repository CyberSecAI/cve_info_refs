    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2007-5711",
      "CVERequestURL": "https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5711"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Analysis Summary": "The provided content describes a denial-of-service vulnerability in the game World in Conflict. Sending a UDP or TCP packet larger than 1362 bytes to the game port (48000) triggers an assertion failure, causing the game server to terminate.",
      "Root cause": "The game's code has insufficient bounds checking when processing incoming network packets. Specifically, the 'GetWriteOffset' function in the 'MN_Packet.cpp' file does not properly validate if there is enough space in the buffer to write the incoming data.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Assertion Failure: A failed assertion within the game's code related to buffer size checks when processing network packets.",
        "Denial of Service: The vulnerability leads to a server crash, preventing legitimate users from playing the game."
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition on the game server by sending specially crafted network packets. This leads to server termination and prevents legitimate players from using the server.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Remote network attack using UDP or TCP packets."
      ],
      "Attacker capabilities": "An attacker only needs to send a packet with a size exceeding the expected limit to the game server's port (48000). No authentication or prior access is required."
