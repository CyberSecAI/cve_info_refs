How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### [Wesnoth 1.3.12](./viewtopic.php?p=265050#p265050)

* [Quote](./posting.php?mode=quote&p=265050 "Reply with quote")

[Post](./viewtopic.php?p=265050#p265050 "Post")
by **[ivanovic](./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=972)** » December 1st, 2007, 7:43 pm

**Wesnoth 1.3.12 is out!**

Hmmm, what should I write in here? It is obvious that 1.3.12 is out but what has changed? The most important change was the reason for 1.2.8, the fix of some security bugs. The first one was rather critical. This issue was filed as CVE-2007-5742 and potentially allowed files on the host's computer to be viewed by players or observers if the game was hosted using a malicious era or scenario.

Another problem could arise with the preference option "turn\_cmd". Due to this problem the computer could either be stalled by a faulty add-on or \*maybe\* (we found no way to do so) some other application could be started. This option has now been removed since it probably wasn't used anyway.

As bonus some new music was added. So far no mainline content is using it, but I am sure this will change rather soon. In the meantime some usermade content could already make use of it.

And here is what "The Others" asked me to tell you (really not much this time):

Savegames now have a prefix indicating the campaign they are from if the campaign WML declared an abbrev= tag. All mainline campaigns have this tag. This is meant to allow to see the campaigns the saves and replays do belong to more easily.

What else was changed? Some updated graphics, translations and probably a lot more that I am too lazy to mention now. For a more complete list (not 100% complete, some devs tend to forget adding entries) have a look at the [changelog](http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/wesnoth/tags/1.3.12/changelog?rev=22067&view=download). A changelog with the changes that might be visible to most users (and only includes these) is the [players\_changelog](http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/wesnoth/tags/1.3.12/players_changelog?rev=22067&view=download).

**Downloads**

Sources:

[http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnot ... 2?download](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnoth/wesnoth-1.3.12.tar.bz2?download) (109.5 MB) [md5sum](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnoth/wesnoth-1.3.12.tar.bz2.md5?download)

Here is the xDelta for the sources:

[http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnot ... a?download](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnoth/wesnoth-1.3.11.tar-wesnoth-1.3.12.tar.xdelta?download) (1.3.11 to 1.3.12, 12.4 MB)

Check <http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7034> for info on using xdelta.

The Windows binary is not available yet. Once it is you can find it on the [download page](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Download#Development_.281.3_branch.29).

The MacOSX binary is not available yet. Once it is you can find it on the [download page](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Download#Development_.281.3_branch.29).

The OpenSolaris binary is available on the [download page](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Download#Development_.281.3_branch.29).

So far the OpenSolaris binaries are ready. No idea about the others, but all the known packagers have been contacted. Information about where to get the respective binaries or how to get them work you get on the [Linux binaries site](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/WesnothBinariesLinux) for the Linux binaries. Download links for the other supported systems will be listed at the [downloads page](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Download#Development_.281.3_branch.29) once the binaries are available.

As a fallback you can also get the sources from <http://files.wesnoth.org/> - you should first try to get files through SourceForge to help us save bandwidth.

Soon we will shutdown the 1.3.11 multiplayer server because we want to focus on getting 1.3.12 tested. 1.3.11 and 1.3.12 are not compatible due to some balancing changes. The server for 1.3.12 should be up soon. So consider doing an update as soon as possible. We want to wait with shutting down the old server until the MacOSX and the Windows binary are ready but once they are out we will shut down the old server.

If you find any bugs don't hesitate to report them, but please read the instructions on how to post bugs first. Instructions for bug reporting can be found at <http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/ReportingBugs>.

Enjoy!

Cool. The bat's defense increase was unexpected. Also, the Myrmidon's loss of an attack makes me extremely sad. ![:cry:](./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif "Crying or Very sad") 6 attacks was one of the reasons he was one of my favorite units.

Hopefully the Windows build will not need workarounds to get online this time.

Another new thing for user campaign/addon designers: they can now use if they want some ignore files to setup more precisely which file/directory of the campaign should \*not\* be sent on the addon server.

If can be useful for example if you use a copy of a SVN checkout and you want to opt out the .svn/ administrative directory of the package sent to the addon server.

Full explaination of this new feature here: <http://wiki.wesnoth.org/IGNFileFormat> (it's currently not easily visible from the other documentation -- feel free to fix it)

I often want advanced players who are familiar with a given map and I always state that in title, however some players dont respect that, and often comes back.. then I have to kick many times. Its while creating game. It would be great to have ban option not only in running map. Lack of this feature is really anoying when someone joins even kicked many times.

Saying "please leave" first mostly dosnt work, sometimes they even dont understand english:(

So my begging here is for ban option when starting the game.

I switched to a new compiler and it will be ready as soon as i am able to build it (still fighting some linker problems atm).

Btw, it helps if i don't have to spend my time answering questions about when it will be ready all the time ![:wink:](./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif "Wink") .

Was the primary key used for shortcuts on the Mac version deliberately changed from the standard one (command) to a non-standard one (control)?

It's freakin' annoying...

Shouldn't be too difficult to implement a /ban <nick> command. The server doesn't care whether the game has started or not so you just need an interface to send the ban command in the game lobby. I've probably no time to do it though and usually care only for the server side anyway.

Make a feature request at bugs.wesnoth.org so it doesn't get forgotten and someone will eventually take care of it.

When the latest development version could be ready for windows, is somebody working for it? i mean, if's going to take more than today or tomorrow i will be tempting to try to compile it even if don't have idea on how to do that.

Can't someone compile it and upload it for download?

No windows users have yet feeled the urge to play the last version? ![:(](./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif "Sad")

Can't you have a bit of respect and patience, huh? Yogi Bear is in charge of building and releasing the Windows binaries. He has a life, unlike... unlike some people, and he can't spend all the day on Wesnoth development. Nor on noisy Windows users' requests.

Since YOU obviously feel very strongly about it why haven't YOU taken the time to work out how to install a C++ compiler and then compile the Windows binary yourself within minutes of the source code release?

I'm sure that all the Windows users out there would be highly appreciative of your efforts.

Wesnoth 1.2.8 is out!

This is a bugfix release for 1.2 and it is compatible with the other 1.2 versions. The main reason for this release was an important security fix. This issue was filed as CVE-2007-5742, it did allow others to view the content of files on the remote computer. We did now fix this problem by removing the option to use ../ in paths.

Another problem could arise with the preference option "turn\_cmd". Due to this problem the computer could either be stalled by a faulty add-on or \*maybe\* (we found no way to do so) some other application could be started. This option has now been removed since it probably wasn't used anyway.

Beside those important changes only small things were changed. For all the other changes (really not much), have a look at the [changelog](http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/wesnoth/tags/1.2.8/changelog?rev=21944&view=download).

Since those are rather serious issues we do advise everybody using the 1.2.x stable series to upgrade to 1.2.8 as soon as possible. All saves and the existing content should still work after this upgrade. In general be careful in regards to add-ons you use, there might be some bad ones available even on the official add-on server because the content available there is usually not checked.

**Downloads**

Sources:

[http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnot ... 2?download](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnoth/wesnoth-1.2.8.tar.bz2?download) (69.7 MB) [md5sum](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnoth/wesnoth-1.2.8.tar.bz2.md5?download)

Check <http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7034> for info on using xdelta.

The Windows binary is available. You can find it on the [download page](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Download#Stable_.281.2_branch.29).

The MacOSX binary is available. You can find it on the [download page](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Download#Stable_.281.2_branch.29).

The OpenSolaris binary is not available yet.

So far the Gentoo binaries are ready. No idea about the others, but all the known packagers have been contacted. Information about where to get the respective binaries or how to get them work is available on the [Linux binaries site](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/WesnothBinariesLinux) for the Linux binaries. Download links for the other supported systems will be listed at the [download page](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Download#Stable_.281.2_branch.29) once the binaries are available.

As a fallback you can also get the sources from <http://files.wesnoth.org/> - you should first try to get files through SourceForge to help us save bandwidth.

server.wesnoth.org is ready to be used for multiplayer games.

If you find any bugs don't hesitate to report them, but please read the instructions on how to post bugs first. Instructions for bug reporting can be found at <http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/ReportingBugs>.

Enjoy!

The last one would already have been the last, but there were more critical bugs that had to be fixed. And if there are new critical bugs before the next stable line (1.4.x) is started, there will be another 1.2.x release. But as long as there are no major bugs, there will be no release.

Is it just coincidence that a new version usually seems to come out every month, close to the 20th?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
