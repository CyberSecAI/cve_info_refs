Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-5299:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how SkaDate Online Dating Software handles the `view_mode` parameter in the `featured_list.php` and `online_list.php` scripts. Specifically, it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject directory traversal sequences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, which enables directory traversal through the injection of `../../` sequences within the `view_mode` parameter. This allows access to files outside the intended web root directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote File Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's file system. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information like configuration files, database credentials, or even source code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable scripts (`featured_list.php` or `online_list.php`), specifically manipulating the `view_mode` parameter.
    *   Example: `http://www.site.com/member/featured_list.php?view_mode=../../../../file%00`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication or specific position is required.

**Summary:**
The provided content from Exploit-DB gives more detail than the CVE description by specifying vulnerable files, the vulnerable parameter, and showing an example of the exploitation. It is a remote file disclosure vulnerability caused by insufficient sanitization of the `view_mode` parameter, allowing attackers to read arbitrary files.
