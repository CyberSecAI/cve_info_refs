# CVE-2007-5469

| **Name** | CVE-2007-5469 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | OpenSER 1.2.2 does not verify the Digest authentication header URI against the Request URI in SIP messages, which allows remote attackers to use sniffed Digest authentication credentials to call arbitrary telephone numbers or spoof caller ID (aka "toll fraud and authentication forward attack"). NOTE: Debian disputes this issue, stating that "having the two URIs mismatch is allowed by the standard and happens in some setups for valid reasons. |

I can dig up the patch mentionned on full-disclosure, but it's only
one part of the solution. The user needs to add the required logic in
its config to actually "fix" the problem.

Also it's not clear yet whether this also applies to OpenSER < 1.2,
though the post on full-disclosure seems to imply that all versions
prior to SVN 20071004 are affected.

Practically, the check can be done in all versions of openser>=1.0.0,
but a bit more complex. The update in the SVN just eases the check, by
making the digest URI directly available via a pseudo-variable.

The solution for older versions is:

- write the body if Authorization/Proxy-Authorization header in an AVP
via avp_printf()
- do an avp_subst() and substract the value of the digest URI in another AVP
- use avp_check() to check it against R-URI

The solution of letting the check in config file is to give more liberty
in performing it. Imagine that the proxies are behind a load balancer,
and the R-URI is changed by the LB, in that case all auth will fail. The
admin can add the initial R-URI in a special header at LB and in the
proxy compare that value with the digest URI. Embedding this check in
auth modules seemed too rigid.

Cheers,
Daniel

That's what I thought too...

Indeed.

I think someone's been a bit too trigger-happy with the CVE
assignment. I'll upload packages patched with SVN rev 2852 if the
security team feels it's necessary, otherwise I'm perfectly happy with
just closing that bug report.

This was marked as a security flaw with low impact in the
security tracker by me. So this is no "please upload as fast
as possible" bug but I think the patch won't hurt.

The patch doesn't fix anything but makes it easier to do the check in
its simplest form in the config file.

This is not a vulnerability, it's not even a flaw because having the
two URIs mismatch is allowed by the standard and happens in some
setups for valid reasons.

There's no hole in OpenSER itself; depending on the user setup,
checking the URIs can be required or not, so it's entirely a config
issue from there on.

I don't consider this a security issue as far as Debian is concerned
and I recommend not issuing a DSA for this. I feel issuing a DSA for
this issue could potentially mislead our users, letting them think the
update handles the problem when it doesn't.

So if you agree with this, I'm just going to leave this bug open and
I'll close it with the OpenSER 1.3 upload in december.

JB.

Ok sounds plausible.

Ok, I marked it as unimportant and downgraded this bug.
Thanks for your efforts!
