- Root cause of vulnerability: Multiple input validation issues and a local file inclusion vulnerability in Alstrasoft Affiliate Network Pro.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Input validation flaws: Multiple unspecified input validation issues.
    - Local file inclusion: The `downloadbackup.php` script allows a local file inclusion via the `fl` parameter.
- Impact of exploitation:
    - Remote attackers can potentially read arbitrary local files on the server by exploiting the local file inclusion vulnerability.
- Attack vectors:
    - The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `downloadbackup.php` script with a manipulated `fl` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required.
