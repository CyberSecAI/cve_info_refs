Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-5037:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `inotifytools_snprintf` function within the `inotify-tools` library. Specifically, the `strncpy` function is used without proper bounds checking when copying strings into the output buffer `out`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `strncpy` calls within `inotifytools_snprintf` use a fixed-size buffer, and the code fails to ensure that the length of the strings being copied do not exceed the buffer size, potentially leading to a buffer overflow. This occurs when handling filenames, event names, or time strings. The `MAX_STRLEN` constant was used which is a large value, however, it did not represent the true size of the buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The buffer overflow can be exploited by a context-dependent attacker to execute arbitrary code. This is due to the fact that an attacker could potentially overwrite adjacent memory locations on the stack or heap, ultimately leading to control-flow hijacking.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Long Filename:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a long filename. Since the code copies the filename to a fixed-size buffer, a large filename will cause an overflow.
- **Format String:** The format string passed to `inotifytools_snprintf` controls which fields are written to the buffer. This format string and the user supplied arguments are used to control the content being written to the output buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Context-Dependent:** The specific method of exploitation is described as "context-dependent" suggesting the exact method may depend on how inotify-tools is used in a particular setting, however a long filename is known to be a reliable attack vector.
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path with a crafted input, which would require a degree of control over the arguments to the function (e.g., control the filename being monitored).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in inotify-tools versions prior to 3.11.
- The fix involves using the actual buffer size (`size`) instead of the large `MAX_STRLEN` constant in the `strncpy` calls.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DSA-1440-1) highlights that this vulnerability affects the internal library of `inotify-tools` and not the frontend tools.
- Patches were backported to older versions such as the 3.3 release in Debian etch.
