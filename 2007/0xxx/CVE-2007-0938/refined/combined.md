How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Vulnerability Details

#### CMS Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0938:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Content Management Server because of the way that it handles a specially crafted HTTP request.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for CMS Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0938:

* On Microsoft Internet Information Service 6.0, the W3WP.exe worker process by default is a low-privilege process running as the built-in Network Service account.

  **Note** - This only applies to Content Management Server 2002.
* Customers who have configured Microsoft Content Management Server (MCMS) Web sites in their own application pools to isolate them from other Web sites could limit the impact of an attack.

#### Workarounds for CMS Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0938:

We have not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for CMS Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0938:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Content Management Server because of the way that it handles a specially crafted HTTP request. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

A remote code execution vulnerability results from the way that the Microsoft Content Management Server handles unexpected characters in an HTTP request.

**What is Microsoft Content Management Server?**

[Microsoft Content Management Server](https://www.microsoft.com/cmserver/default.mspx) (MCMS) enables customers to build, deploy, and maintain Web sites. Using MCMS, customers can create, publish and manage Web content, as well as managing the server resources that are available to the site.

**I am running Microsoft Content Management Server 2001 and have customized the ManualLogin.asp file, is there anything I need to do?**

This security update does not update ManualLogin.asp. Any customizations done to this page will therefore remain after this update has been applied. We do still recommend that customized ASP pages are backed up before doing maintenance on any Web site.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted URL and sending an HTTP GET request to a CMS system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Web sites that are maintained using an affected versions of Microsoft Content Management Server.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Content Management Server validates an HTTP request.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Cross-site Scripting and Spoofing Vulnerability in CMS Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0939:

A cross-site scripting and spoofing vulnerability exists in Microsoft Content Management Server (MCMS) which could allow an attacker to convince a user to run a malicious script. If this malicious script is run, it would execute in the security context of the user. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability require user interaction. This vulnerability could allow an attacker access to any data on the affected systems that was accessible to the individual user.

It may also be possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability to modify Web browser caches and intermediate proxy server caches, and put spoofed content in those caches.

#### Mitigating Factors for Cross-site Scripting and Spoofing Vulnerability in CMS Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0939:

* The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click a Web link that is sent in an e-mail message.
* An attack would only be successful if the user that was convinced to click on the attackerâs specially crafted URL had access to the CMS Web server.
* An attacker who successfully exploited the cross-site scripting aspect of this vulnerability would gain only the same permissions as the user.
* Clients who have turned on the Do not save encrypted pages to disk advanced Internet option in Internet Explorer would not be at risk from any attempts to put spoofed content into the client cache if they accessed their Web site through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
* Clients who use SSL-protected connections to access the affected Web sites would not be vulnerable to attempts to put spoofed content on intermediate proxy server caches. This is because SSL session data is encrypted and is not cached on intermediate proxy servers.
* If spoofed content is successfully put in an intermediate proxy serverâs cache, it could be difficult for an attacker to predict which users would be served the spoofed cached content.

#### Workarounds for Cross-site Scripting and Spoofing Vulnerability in CMS Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0939:

Microsoft has tested the following workaround. Although these workaround will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Setting an MCMS site to Yes-Read Only will disable content authoring and access to that MCMS server entry point from Site Manager**

  Setting an MCMS site to **Yes-Read Only** will disable content authoring and access to that MCMS server entry point from Site Manager, but doesnât remove any files from the file system. If you want to use the Site Manager tool to modify settings on a read-only MCMS site, you must first make the site read-write in the Web Server Configuration tool.
  Setting an MCMS site to read-only means that you canât use the client-side SDAPI (or Site Manager) to deploy content. On a read-only site, you must use the server-side SDAPI for content deployment API unless you have a separate read-write Web entry point.

  **To modify the MCMS site to Yes-Read Only, follow these steps:**

  1. Click **Start**, click **Programs**, and then select **Microsoft Content Management Server**.
  2. Click **Server Configuration Application**.
  3. Click the **Web** tab and then select **Configure**.
  4. In the dialog box for the MCMS Web site you wish to configure, select **Yes - Read Only**.
  5. Click **OK** to save the changes.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Users will no longer be able to author content via MCMS Web Author (you cannot login with edit rights on an MCMS Server) nor via Site Manager.

#### FAQ for Cross-site Scripting and Spoofing Vulnerability in Microsoft Content Management Server Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0939:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A cross-site scripting and spoofing vulnerability exists in Microsoft Content Management Server (MCMS). The vulnerability could allow the injection of a client-side script in the user's browser. In a Web-based attack scenario a compromised Web site could accept or host user-provided content or advertisements which could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability.

The script could take any action on the user's behalf that the Web site is authorized to take. This could include monitoring the Web session and forwarding information to a third party, running other code on the user's system, and reading or writing cookies.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is caused by the Microsoft Content Management Server not completely validating input that is provided in a HTML redirection query before it sends this input to the browser.

**What is Microsoft Content Management Server?**

[Microsoft Content Management Server](https://www.microsoft.com/cmserver/default.mspx) (MCMS) enables customers to build, deploy, and maintain Web sites. Using MCMS, customers can create, publish and manage Web content, as well as managing the server resources that are available to the site.

**What is cross-site scripting?**

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to "inject" script code into a user's session with a Web site. The vulnerability can affect Web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of "trusted" sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the Web sites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify Web site content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.

**How does cross-site scripting work?**

Web pages contain text and HTML markup. Text and HTML markup are generated by the server and are interpreted by the client. If untrusted content is introduced into a dynamic page, neither the server nor the client has sufficient information to recognize that this injection has occurred and to take protective measures.

**I am running Microsoft Content Management Server 2001 and have customized the ManualLogin.asp file, is there anything I need to do?**

This security update does not update ManualLogin.asp. Any customizations done to this page will therefore remain after this update has been applied. We do still recommend that customized ASP pages are backed up before doing maintenance on any Web site.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could inject a client side script in the user's browser. The script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected Web site. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability would require user interaction. It may also be possible to exploit the vulnerability to manipulate Web browser caches and intermediate proxy server caches, and put spoofed content in those caches.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In an e-mail attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted e-mail message to a user of a server that is running an affected software application. The attacker could then convince the user to click a link in the e-mail message.

In a Web-based attack scenario a compromised Web an attacker could inject a client side script in the user's browser. The script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected Web site. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability would require user interaction.

It may also be possible to exploit the vulnerability to modify Web browser caches and intermediate proxy server caches and to put spoofed content in those caches.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Web sites that are maintained using an affected versions of Microsoft Content Management Server.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. An attacker would need to know the full name of the CMS server being targeted for an attack.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Content Management Server validates HTTP redirection queries.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued. This security bulletin addresses the privately disclosed vulnerability as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the frequently asked question, âCan I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?â in the section, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update, earlier in this bulletin.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
