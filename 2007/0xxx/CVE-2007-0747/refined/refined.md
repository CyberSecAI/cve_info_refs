Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-0747:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Apple Macintosh OS X handles the mounting of WebDAV filesystems. Specifically, the `load_webdav` program, used during the mounting process, does not properly sanitize its environment before execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Environment Cleaning:** The `load_webdav` program fails to clean the environment before being launched, which can allow malicious actors to inject their own environment variables or files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands with elevated (system) privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the vulnerable system.
- **WebDAV Filesystem:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate or create a WebDAV filesystem or mount point that is then used by the system.
- **Environment Manipulation:** The attack involves manipulating the environment in which the vulnerable `load_webdav` program executes. This might include things such as setting crafted environment variables or placing malicious files in the search path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the affected Apple Macintosh OS X system.
- The attacker needs to be able to create or manipulate a WebDAV resource that the system is attempting to mount.
- The attacker must have some ability to control the execution environment of the `load_webdav` program, such as by setting environment variables.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by Apple in Security Update 2007-004.
- The vulnerability allows for privilege escalation, as a local user could execute commands with system privileges.
- The vulnerability is related to the `load_webdav` program and its lack of proper environment cleaning.
