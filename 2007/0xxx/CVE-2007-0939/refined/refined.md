Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0939:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Microsoft Content Management Server not properly validating input provided in an HTML redirection query before sending it to the browser. This lack of validation allows for the injection of client-side scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the presence of an XSS vulnerability, which allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into a user's browser session.
- Spoofing: The vulnerability also enables spoofing, allowing attackers to potentially modify web browser caches and intermediate proxy server caches with malicious content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Execution of Malicious Scripts: An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the user's session, potentially taking actions on the user's behalf. This includes monitoring sessions, forwarding information to third parties, executing code, and accessing cookies.
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can access data on the affected system that the user has access to.
- Content Spoofing: Attackers can modify web browser caches and intermediate proxy server caches, leading to users viewing spoofed content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Email: An attacker could send a specially crafted email with a malicious link, tricking users into clicking the link and executing the malicious script when accessing a compromised web site.
- Web-Based: A compromised website could host user-provided content or advertisements with malicious scripts.
- Crafted URLs: An attacker can construct a specific URL to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User Interaction: Exploitation requires user interaction, such as clicking on a malicious link, to be successful.
- Knowledge of Target: Attackers need to know the full name of the CMS server being targeted to exploit the vulnerability over the internet.
- Access to CMS Server: The user being targeted must have access to the CMS web server for the attack to succeed.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is described as an "Important" severity, with a "Critical" aggregate severity when combined with CVE-2007-0938
- The provided content notes that Netcraft's Martyn Tovey reported the vulnerability
- The provided Microsoft Security Bulletin MS07-018 provides a patch for the vulnerability, and also workarounds for the vulnerability
- The patch modifies the way the Content Management Server validates HTTP redirection queries.
