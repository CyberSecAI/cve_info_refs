		"Cross Domain Scripting"
      ],
      "impact": "Complete control over an AJAX application, including the ability to intercept, modify, or inject requests and responses, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or defacement. Arbitrary code execution through UXSS, and persistent cross-domain scripting.",
