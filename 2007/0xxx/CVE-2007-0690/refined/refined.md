Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0690:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from flaws in the `myevent.php` and `login.php` scripts within the myEvent application. These flaws lead to PHP warnings and fatal errors, which unintentionally disclose the server's file paths in error messages. Specifically, the `htmlspecialchars()` function is expecting a string but receives an array, causing a warning, and an undefined function `notice()` is called causing a fatal error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is path disclosure. Error messages reveal the full server-side file paths to the application's PHP scripts.
*   **Improper Error Handling:** The application's error handling is insufficient, allowing PHP errors to be displayed to the user, leading to the path disclosure.
*  **Type Juggling**: The application passes an array when a string is expected by the `htmlspecialchars()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can learn the exact server-side path to the application's files.
*   **Potential Further Attacks:** Knowing the file paths can aid attackers in identifying further vulnerabilities, planning targeted attacks, or exploiting known vulnerabilities in specific software versions or server setups. This information can be used in combination with other vulnerabilities to compromise the system or the application.
*  **No Direct Impact on Integrity or Availability**: The disclosure does not directly impact the integrity or availability of the system or data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerabilities are triggered by crafting specific HTTP GET requests to `myevent.php` with malformed parameters or by accessing `login.php` without providing a password.
    *   `http://[TARGET]/[PRODUCT-DIRECTORY]/myevent.php?monthno[]=2&year=2007`
    *   `http://[TARGET]/[PRODUCT-DIRECTORY]/myevent.php?view[]=1`
    *   `http://[TARGET]/[PRODUCT-DIRECTORY]/login.php` (and then trying to log in without a password)
*   **Remote Access:** The attacks are performed remotely, needing no local system access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker requires only basic understanding of crafting HTTP requests to trigger the vulnerabilities.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited without needing to authenticate to the application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory explicitly mentions that the vendor was notified multiple times but did not respond or provide a fix.
*   The advisory recommends a workaround, which involves disabling error messages in `php.ini` or using `.htaccess` for Apache servers. This workaround does not resolve the underlying vulnerability, only suppresses the error messages that disclose the path.
*   The advisory provides specific examples of vulnerable HTTP requests and the resulting server responses which expose the file paths.
*   The severity is labeled as "Low", with a CVSS base score of 2.3.
