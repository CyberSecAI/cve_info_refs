      "details": "This content is related to OpenBSD 3.9 errata and patches. While it does not explicitly mention CVE-2007-0085, it lists several security fixes that are relevant. Specifically, patch 020 for ICMP6 packet handling might be relevant to this CVE but that is not conclusive.\n\n- **001: SECURITY FIX: March 25, 2006**: A race condition exists in sendmail signal handling. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with sendmail privileges (typically root).\n- **002: SECURITY FIX: May 2, 2006**: X.Org server vulnerability (CVE-2006-1526) where authorized clients can crash the server and execute malicious code.\n- **003: SECURITY FIX: June 15, 2006**: A denial of service in sendmail due to excessive recursion triggered by malformed MIME messages.\n- **004: SECURITY FIX: July 30, 2006**: An off-by-one buffer overflow in httpd's mod_rewrite (CVE-2006-3747). Default installations are not affected.\n- **005: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**: A denial of service in sendmail caused by a use-after-free bug due to long header lines.\n- **006: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**: An off-by-one error in dhcpd that causes it to exit when a DHCPDISCOVER packet with a 32-byte client identifier is received (CVE-2006-3122).\n- **007: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**: Kernel panic caused by allocating more than the default number of semaphores.\n- **008: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**: isakmpd vulnerability leading to IPsec running without replay protection. An attacker could reinject sniffed IPsec packets.\n- **009: SECURITY FIX: September 2, 2006**: Kernel panic caused by LCP packets with incorrectly validated configuration option lengths (CVE-2006-4304).\n- **010: SECURITY FIX: September 8, 2006**: Two Denial of Service issues in BIND where recursive queries or SIG RRsets can stop DNS service (CVE-2006-4095, CVE-2006-4096).\n- **011: SECURITY FIX: September 8, 2006**: Invalid PKCS#1 v1.5 signature accepted by OpenSSL (CVE-2006-4339).\n- **012: SECURITY FIX: October 7, 2006**: httpd XSS vulnerability due to unsanitized Expect header in error messages (CVE-2006-3918).\n- **013: SECURITY FIX: October 7, 2006**: Multiple OpenSSL issues: infinite loop, buffer overflow, NULL pointer dereference (CVE-2006-2937, CVE-2006-3738, CVE-2006-4343, CVE-2006-2940).\n- **014: SECURITY FIX: October 7, 2006**: Integer overflow in systrace's STRIOCREPLACE support leading to DoS, kmem reads, or local privilege escalation.\n- **015: SECURITY FIX: October 12, 2006**: Two OpenSSH vulnerabilities: pre-authentication DoS and unsafe signal handler (CVE-2006-4924, CVE-2006-5051).\n- **016: SECURITY FIX: November 19, 2006**: ld.so fails to sanitize the environment leading to a potential localhost security problem.\n- **017: SECURITY FIX: January 3, 2007**: Insufficient validation in vga may allow an attacker to gain root privileges on i386 systems with `option PCIAGP`.\n- **018: RELIABILITY FIX: January 16, 2007**: Kernel infinite loop when processing ICMP6 echo requests.\n- **019: INTEROPERABILITY FIX: February 4, 2007**: US daylight saving time rules change update.\n- **020: SECURITY FIX: March 7, 2007**: Incorrect mbuf handling for ICMP6 packets. A workaround is to use pf to block these packets.\n- **021: SECURITY FIX: April 4, 2007**: Multiple X.Org vulnerabilities: memory corruption, integer overflows in various functions (CVE-2007-1003, CVE-2007-1351, CVE-2007-1352, CVE-2007-1667).\n- **022: SECURITY FIX: April 23, 2007**: IPv6 type 0 route headers can be used for DoS attacks.\n- **023: STABILITY FIX: April 26, 2007**: Unhandled AltiVec assist exception causing a kernel panic on PowerPC."
