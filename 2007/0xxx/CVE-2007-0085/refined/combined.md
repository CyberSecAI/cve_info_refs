* **001: SECURITY FIX: March 25, 2006**
    *All architectures*

  A race condition has been reported to exist in the handling by sendmail of
  asynchronous signals. A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running sendmail, typically root. This is the second revision of
  this patch.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/001_sendmail.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: May 2, 2006**
      *All architectures*

    A security vulnerability has been found in the X.Org server --
    [CVE-2006-1526](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1526).
    Clients authorized to connect to the X server are able to crash it and to execute
    malicious code within the X server.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/002_xorg.patch)

    * **003: SECURITY FIX: June 15, 2006**
        *All architectures*

      A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A malformed MIME
      message could trigger excessive recursion which will lead to stack exhaustion.
      This denial of service attack only affects delivery of mail from the queue and
      delivery of a malformed message. Other incoming mail is still accepted and
      delivered. However, mail messages in the queue may not be reattempted if a
      malformed MIME message exists.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/003_sendmail2.patch)

      * **004: SECURITY FIX: July 30, 2006**
          *All architectures*

        [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/httpd.8)'s
        mod\_rewrite has a potentially exploitable off-by-one buffer overflow.
        The buffer overflow may result in a vulnerability which, in combination
        with certain types of Rewrite rules in the web server configuration files,
        could be triggered remotely. The default install is not affected by the
        buffer overflow. CVE-2006-3747

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/004_httpd.patch)

        * **005: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
            *All architectures*

          A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A message
          with really long header lines could trigger a use-after-free bug causing
          sendmail to crash.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/005_sendmail3.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
              *All architectures*

            Due to an off-by-one error in
            [dhcpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/dhcpd.8),
            it is possible to cause
            [dhcpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/dhcpd.8)
            to exit by sending a DHCPDISCOVER packet with a 32-byte client identifier option.
            [CVE-2006-3122](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3122)

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/006_dhcpd.patch)

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                *All architectures*

              It is possible to cause the kernel to panic when more than the default number of
              semaphores have been allocated.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/007_sem.patch)

              * **008: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                  *All architectures*

                A problem in
                [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/isakmpd.8)
                caused IPsec to run partly without replay protection. If
                [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/isakmpd.8)
                was acting as responder during SA negotiation, SA's with a replay window of size 0 were created.
                An attacker could reinject sniffed IPsec packets, which will be accepted without checking the
                replay counter.

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/008_isakmpd.patch)

                * **009: SECURITY FIX: September 2, 2006**
                    *All architectures*

                  Due to the failure to correctly validate LCP configuration option lengths,
                  it is possible for an attacker to send LCP packets via an
                  [sppp(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/sppp.4)
                  connection causing the kernel to panic.
                  [CVE-2006-4304](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4304)

                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/009_sppp.patch)

                  * **010: SECURITY FIX: September 8, 2006**
                      *All architectures*

                    Two Denial of Service issues have been found with BIND.
                    An attacker who can perform recursive lookups on a DNS server and is able
                    to send a sufficiently large number of recursive queries, or is able to
                    get the DNS server to return more than one SIG(covered) RRsets can stop
                    the functionality of the DNS service.
                    An attacker querying an authoritative DNS server serving a RFC 2535
                    DNSSEC zone may be able to crash the DNS server.
                    [CVE-2006-4095](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4095)
                    [CVE-2006-4096](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4096)

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/010_bind.patch)

                    * **011: SECURITY FIX: September 8, 2006**
                        *All architectures*

                      Due to incorrect PKCS#1 v1.5 padding validation in OpenSSL, it is possible for
                      an attacker to construct an invalid signature which OpenSSL would accept as a
                      valid PKCS#1 v1.5 signature.
                      [CVE-2006-4339](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4339)

                      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/011_openssl.patch)

                      * **012: SECURITY FIX: October 7, 2006**
                          *All architectures*

                        [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/httpd.8)
                        does not sanitize the Expect header from an HTTP request when it is
                        reflected back in an error message, which might allow cross-site scripting (XSS)
                        style attacks.
                        [CVE-2006-3918](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3918)

                        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/012_httpd2.patch)

                        * **013: SECURITY FIX: October 7, 2006**
                            *All architectures*

                          Several problems have been found in OpenSSL. While parsing certain invalid ASN.1
                          structures an error condition is mishandled, possibly resulting in an infinite
                          loop. A buffer overflow exists in the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers function. A NULL
                          pointer may be dereferenced in the SSL version 2 client code. In addition, many
                          applications using OpenSSL do not perform any validation of the lengths of
                          public keys being used.
                          [CVE-2006-2937](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2937),

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
