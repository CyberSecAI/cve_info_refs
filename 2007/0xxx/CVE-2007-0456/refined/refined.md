Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-0456

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is within multiple protocol dissectors in Wireshark (formerly Ethereal). Specifically, issues were identified in the LLT, IEEE 802.11, HTTP, and TCP protocol dissectors when reading packets live from the network. These dissectors would crash or hang when processing specially crafted or malformed packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Multiple denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities exist in different protocol dissectors:
*   **TCP Dissector:** Could hang or crash while reassembling HTTP packets.
*   **HTTP Dissector:** Could crash.
*   **IEEE 802.11 Dissector:** Could crash on some systems.
*   **LLT Dissector:** Could crash on some systems.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities leads to denial of service conditions. An attacker can cause Wireshark or Ethereal to crash or consume excessive memory, preventing its intended function (packet analysis). This could disrupt network monitoring and troubleshooting activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors involve injecting purposefully malformed packets into the network or convincing a user to open a malformed packet trace file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be in a position to inject network traffic into a network being monitored by a vulnerable Wireshark/Ethereal instance or be able to provide the user with a malformed packet trace file. 
*   On some systems, specifically RedHat systems, an authenticated local user would have to be able to start Wireshark (tshark) for exploitation.
*   For Avaya systems, only Avaya Service Technicians have the necessary permissions.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerabilities affect Wireshark (and the old Ethereal packages) versions from 0.10.14 up to and including 0.99.4.
*   Wireshark version 0.99.5 contains the fix for these vulnerabilities.
*   A workaround involves disabling the affected dissectors (HTTP, IEEE 802.11 and LLT) within the software.
*   Avaya recommends restricting local and network access to systems running vulnerable versions of Wireshark/Ethereal.
*   The Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2007-0066 is also related to these vulnerabilities.
