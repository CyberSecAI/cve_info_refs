  "CVE-2007-0988": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The zend_hash_init() function in PHP can be forced into an infinite loop when unserializing untrusted data on 64-bit platforms, leading to CPU resource consumption.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of untrusted data during unserialization on 64-bit platforms.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Infinite loop vulnerability",
        "Denial-of-service vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service by causing the server to consume excessive CPU resources due to an infinite loop. This consumes CPU resources until script timeout.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Unserialization of malicious data."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to submit specially crafted, untrusted data to a PHP application that uses unserialization.",
