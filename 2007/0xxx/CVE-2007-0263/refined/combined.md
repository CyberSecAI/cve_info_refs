Total Commander not affected by vulnerability in log4j **December 15, 2021:** We currently get a lot of questions whether Total Commander is affected by the [log4j Java vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046)](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/ "Opens in new window"):  Total Commander for Windows is not based on Java, and is not using log4j, so it is not directly affected.  There are some very old 32-bit java-based third party plugins from 2007, but they use an older, not vulnerable version of log4j: The included log4j-1.2.8.jar is not vulnerable, because the vulnerable JNDI lookup functions were only added in log4j 2.0.0. These plugins use the [Java Plugin Interface](http://totalcmd.net/plugring/tc_java.html). You may want to search for tc\_javaplugin.ini to check if you have any of them installed.  Total Commander for Android is based on Java, but neither it nor any of the plugins uses log4j.

Secure FTP client (FTP over SSL/TLS) broken by recent Windows update **October 13, 2019:** Unfortunately a recent security update in Windows 7/8/8.1/10 has broken the sChannel (Secur32.dll) Windows library used for secure FTP connections in Total Commander: The connection fails downloading the directory listing if the server requires SSL session re-use.
