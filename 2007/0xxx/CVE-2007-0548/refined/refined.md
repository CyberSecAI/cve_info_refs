  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Sami HTTP Server is unable to handle more than 2002 requests to non-existent files, pages, or folders.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to the server's inability to handle a large number of requests for non-existent resources.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The server stops responding to requests, stops writing to the log file, and the administrator is unable to kick or ban users. The only resolution is to kill the process.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a large number of HTTP GET requests for non-existent resources to the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection with the vulnerable server."
