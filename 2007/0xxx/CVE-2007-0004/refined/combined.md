Please understand, that RHEL3 and RHEL4 behave different! Hopefully only behavior of RHEL4 sounds correct/reasonable for you: RHEL4: # ll /ks/etc/testfile -rw------- 1 root other 20 Mar 20 14:00  /ks/etc/testfile # more /ks/etc/testfile /ks/etc/testfile: Permission denied # cat /ks/etc/testfile /ks/etc/testfile: Permission denied RHEL3: # ll /ks/etc/testfile -rw------- 1 root other 20 Mar 20 14:00  /ks/etc/testfile # more /ks/etc/testfile (no output, expected: "/ks/etc/testfile: permission denied") # cat /ks/etc/testfile cat: /ks/etc/testfile: Input/output error  /ks/etc/tesfile is nfs-mounted volume with options "ro,noacl,rsize=wsize=8192", either from solaris/VxFS or netapp-filer or RHEL4-nfs-server.  So I'm asking once again to fix this "noacl"-problem/bug on RHEL3, (as it has been done in RHEL4),   to not have to think about switching off "rootsquash"-option on our nfs-servers and its implications.   Internal Status set to 'Waiting on SEG' Status set to: Waiting on Tech  This event sent from IssueTracker by jlayton  [Support Engineering Group]  issue 90713   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=199715#c4)  Jeff Layton    2006-07-28 12:49:45 UTC  ``` Added some code around the readpage: section of do_generic_file_read. It looks like the EIO comes from there. Apparently, this returns 0:             error = mapping->a_ops->readpage(filp, page);   ...and then generic_file_readahead() doesn't set F_ATOMIC in the flags, so we return -EIO:  do_generic_file_read: setting desc error on read of testfile to -5  This section of code is quite a bit different upstream, so still looking at what it does differently.    ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=199715#c5)  Jeff Layton    2006-07-28 15:20:33 UTC  ``` 2.4.32 never even calls do_generic_file_read for the file, so some of the calling functions must be returning EACCES before it even gets to that point.    ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=199715#c7)  Jeff Layton    2006-07-31 13:32:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 133319](attachment.cgi?id=133319&action=diff "patch 1") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=133319&action=edit "patch 1") patch 1  This patch seems to correct the problem and looks to be the right approach. When noacl is specified, RHEL3 skips the NFS ACCESS call to the server and relies on vfs_permission, which just uses the mode bits. This is obviously wrong in a root squash situation.  The 2.4.32 nfs_permission routine is very different from the one in RHEL3, but I've not been able to track down the upstream patches that made those changes. Still, when it comes to this situation it seems to follow the same logic.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=199715#c8)  Jeff Layton    2006-07-31 13:48:28 UTC  ``` Actually, it looks like that line was changed as part of the NFS ACL patch, and that patch never went upstream. So patch 1 should be ok.    ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=199715#c12)  Jeff Layton    2006-08-15 13:54:39 UTC  ``` Changing back to ASSIGNED based on feedback from Ingo M. I'm going to respin this patch so that this behavior is contingent on a new mount option noacl_safe.    ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=199715#c13)  Jeff Layton    2006-08-15 18:25:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 134240](attachment.cgi?id=134240&action=diff "patch 2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=134240&action=edit "patch 2") patch 2  This patch adds a "noacl_safe" mount option for nfs, and makes the "correct" behavior contingent upon it. The regular noacl option should behave as it has up until now.  I'll also clone this BZ and post the corresponding patch for mount to it.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=199715#c15)  Jeff Layton    2006-08-15 19:28:55 UTC  ``` Peter S. indicated that this is just a bug plain and simple, and patch 2 really serves no purpose. So, I'll stick with proposing patch 1.    ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=199715#c22)  RHEL Program Management    2006-12-18 23:41:14 UTC  ``` Product Management has reviewed and declined this request.  You may appeal this decision by reopening this request.    ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=199715#c35)  Jay Turner    2007-02-20 12:47:16 UTC  ``` QE ack for 3.9.   ```  [Comment 46](show_bug.cgi?id=199715#c46)  Ernie Petrides    2007-03-13 23:06:52 UTC  ``` Moving to "Documentation" component for release note tracking.    ```  [Comment 49](show_bug.cgi?id=199715#c49)  Issue Tracker    2007-06-29 11:10:56 UTC  ``` There have been no updates to this issue in the past month.
