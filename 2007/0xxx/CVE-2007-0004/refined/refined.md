{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "When the 'noacl' mount option is used with NFS and 'root_squash' is enabled on the server, the client incorrectly skips the NFS ACCESS call and relies on local mode bits. This results in a bypass of the intended 'root_squash' restrictions, allowing unauthorized access by root clients.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of access control when 'noacl' option is used in conjunction with 'root_squash' on NFS.",
       "Lack of proper permission checks on the client side."
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized access to files on an NFS share where root access should have been restricted due to 'root_squash'.  Instead of a 'permission denied' error, 'Input/output error' or no output occurs when attempting to access the file.",
    "attack_vectors": "Mounting an NFS share with the 'noacl' option when 'root_squash' is enabled on the server.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to mount an NFS share with the noacl option and have root access on the client machine."
