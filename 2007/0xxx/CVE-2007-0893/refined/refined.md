Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in phpMyVisites prior to version 2.2:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** Improper handling of the "url" parameter when the "pagename" parameter starts with "FILE:".
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Vulnerability in the `GetCurrentCompletePath()` function due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the URL path.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Inadequate validation of the `pmv_ck_view` cookie, which is used in a `require()` call to include language files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate the "url" parameter when "pagename" begins with "FILE:", allowing attackers to inject malicious headers into the HTTP response.
*   **XSS:** The `GetCurrentCompletePath()` function reflects part of the URL path without proper sanitization, allowing injection of client-side script.
*   **LFI:** The application does not properly validate user-controlled cookie data (`pmv_ck_view`) leading to arbitrary local file inclusion. The `strpos()` check is flawed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** An attacker can manipulate the HTTP response, potentially leading to:
    *   Cache poisoning.
    *   Cross-site scripting (if combined with other vulnerabilities).
    *   Bypassing security controls.
*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application's pages, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Defacement of the web page.
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
    *   Stealing sensitive information.
*   **LFI:** An attacker can include arbitrary local files, leading to:
    *   Reading sensitive application files, including configuration and source code.
    *   Potentially achieving remote code execution (if the included file contains executable code).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** By crafting a specific URL with "pagename" starting with "FILE:" and a malicious "url" parameter.
*   **XSS:** By injecting a script tag in the URL path.
*   **LFI:** By crafting a malicious `pmv_ck_view` cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpMyVisites instance.
*   For HTTP Response Splitting and XSS, the attacker only needs to send requests. For LFI, the attacker needs to be able to set cookies (easily done through their browser or by scripting).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were addressed in phpMyVisites version 2.2 stable.
*   The code snippet provided shows the flawed logic in the file inclusion check.
*   The email mentions that external libraries used by phpMyVisites (smarty, phpMailer, PEAR) also had vulnerabilities that were patched in version 2.2 stable.
