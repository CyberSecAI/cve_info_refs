{
  "CVE-2007-0998": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The VNC server code in QEMU allowed monitor access via Ctrl+Alt+2, which enabled execution of commands such as 'change cdrom' without proper validation, allowing for arbitrary file mapping to the guest VM's CDROM device.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Lack of validation on files mapped to the CDROM device.",
        "Unrestricted access to the QEMU monitor via VNC.",
        "Weak or missing authentication for VNC connections.",
        "QEMU instances running as root on the host OS."
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "A VNC console user could execute commands through the QEMU monitor, allowing them to map arbitrary host files into the guest VM, enabling them to modify files like /etc/passwd on the host OS by writing to the mapped device within the guest OS.",
       "Attack vectors": [
         "A VNC user having access to the guest VM's console.",
         "Abuse of the QEMU monitor access feature via Ctrl+Alt+2 within VNC."
       ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Any user with access to the guest VM's VNC console can exploit this vulnerability, provided that monitor access is enabled."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the QEMU VNC server which allows access to the QEMU monitor using 'Ctrl+Alt+2'. The monitor allows changing the CDROM backing file, which can be exploited to map host files to the guest VM as read-write devices.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Lack of proper input validation in the QEMU monitor.",
        "Unrestricted access to the QEMU monitor via the VNC interface.",
        "Insufficient security measures preventing unauthorized access and modifications to the host system via guest VM."
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with access to the guest VM's VNC console can modify host files like `/etc/passwd`, leading to a full compromise of the host OS.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "VNC console access to a fullyvirtualized guest VM.",
        "Exploitation of the QEMU monitor command 'change cdrom' or 'change hdc'."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires access to the VNC console of a vulnerable guest VM. No prior root privileges are needed on the host."
