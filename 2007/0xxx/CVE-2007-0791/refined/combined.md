# 2.20.3, 2.22.1, and 2.23.3 Security Advisory

Friday, Feb 2nd, 2007
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* A possible cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Atom feeds
  produced by Bugzilla.

* Web server settings given by Bugzilla which provide security settings
  to protect data files from access via the web are overridden by the
  mod_perl startup script when running under mod_perl (development
  snapshot only).

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.20.1 and above
Description: Bugzilla does not properly escape some fields in generated
             Atom feeds, which leads to the potential for cross-site
             scripting in feed readers that support javascript and
             properly implement the Atom feed specification.

Class:       Database password disclosure
Affected:    2.23.3 only
Description: Bugzilla development snapshot version 2.23.3 introduced
             the ability to run Bugzilla under mod_perl on Apache.
             The mod_perl initialization script included with Bugzilla
             defines a new  block in the Apache configuration
             for the directory containing Bugzilla. This block fails to
             include permission for .htaccess files to override file
             access permissions.  The .htaccess file shipped with
             Bugzilla prohibits access by web browsers to read the
             localconfig file, which contains the username and password
             for connecting to the database server.
             If you are not running Bugzilla under mod_perl, then this
             does not affect you.

Vulnerability Solutions
=======================

The fix for these issues is included in the
releases. Upgrading to a release with the relevant fix will
protect your installation from possible exploits of these issues.

If you are unable to upgrade but would like to patch just the security
vulnerability, there are patches available for the issues at the
"References" URL.

Full release downloads, patches to upgrade Bugzilla from previous
versions, and git upgrade instructions are available at:

Hash: SHA1
Summary
=======
Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.
This advisory covers two security issues that have recently been
fixed in the Bugzilla code:
+ A possible cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Atom feeds
produced by Bugzilla.
+ Web server settings given by Bugzilla which provide security settings
to protect data files from access via the web are overridden by the
mod\_perl startup script when running under mod\_perl (development
snapshot only).
We strongly advise that 2.20.x users should upgrade to 2.20.4. 2.22
users, and users of 2.16.x or below, should upgrade to 2.22.2. Versions
2.18.x are not affected by either of these vulnerabilities.
Development snapshots of 2.23 before 2.23.4 are also vulnerable to all
of these issues. If you are using a development snapshot, you should
upgrade to 2.23.4, use CVS to update, or apply the patches from the
specific bugs listed below.
Vulnerability Details
=====================
Issue 1
- -------
Class: Cross-Site Scripting
Versions: 2.20.1 and above
Description: Bugzilla does not properly escape some fields in generated
Atom feeds, which leads to the potential for cross-site
scripting in feed readers that support javascript and
properly implement the Atom feed specification.
Reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=367674
Issue 2
- -------
Class: Database password disclosure
Versions: 2.23.3 only
Description: Bugzilla development snapshot version 2.23.3 introduced
the ability to run Bugzilla under mod\_perl on Apache.
The mod\_perl initialization script included with Bugzilla
defines a new <Directory> block in the Apache configuration
for the directory containing Bugzilla. This block fails to
include permission for .htaccess files to override file
access permissions. The .htaccess file shipped with
Bugzilla prohibits access by web browsers to read the
localconfig file, which contains the username and password
for connecting to the database server.
If you are not running Bugzilla under mod\_perl, then this
does not affect you.
Reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=367071
Vulnerability Solutions
=======================
The fixes for all of the security bugs mentioned in this advisory are
included in the 2.20.4, 2.22.2, and 2.23.4 releases. Upgrading to these
releases will protect installations from possible exploits of these
issues.
Full release downloads, patches to upgrade Bugzilla from previous
versions, and CVS upgrade instructions are available at:
http://www.bugzilla.org/download/
Specific patches for each of the individual issues can be found on the
corresponding bug reports for each issue, at the URL given in the
reference for that issue in the list above.
