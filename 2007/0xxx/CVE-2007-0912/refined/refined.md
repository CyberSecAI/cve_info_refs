Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0912:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the `admin/admin.adm.php` file of Jportal version 2.3.1 (and possibly earlier versions).
*   The `add_admin()` function within this file does not properly validate if the request originated from an authenticated admin user within the admin panel. It directly uses GET/POST parameters without checks, which allows an attacker to manipulate parameters to add a new admin user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF:** The core vulnerability is CSRF. The application blindly trusts the incoming request parameters for adding an admin user without validating the origin of the request.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `add_admin()` function doesn't check the source of the request, making it vulnerable to arbitrary parameter injection via GET or POST requests.
*   **Insecure direct object references:**  The script directly uses parameters passed in the request to add the new user, giving the attacker the ability to set user name, password (which will be hashed by the function), email, and access rights.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can create a new administrator account with root privileges on the vulnerable Jportal installation. This essentially gives the attacker full control over the application.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** With a root admin account, the attacker could perform any action available to the administrator, including modifying website content, user data, or potentially gaining access to the server itself. This would lead to complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **Malicious Link/Form:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL or a hidden form on a website they control. When an authenticated admin user clicks this link or visits this page, their browser will unknowingly send the malicious request to the vulnerable Jportal application, creating a new admin account under the attackerâ€™s control.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker may need to employ social engineering to trick an authenticated admin user into clicking the malicious link while they are logged in to Jportal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Software:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerability in Jportal 2.3.1.
*   **Targeted Admin Session:** The attack requires an authenticated admin session. Therefore, the attacker needs the admin user to be logged into Jportal at the time of the attack. The attack would likely fail if the admin user is not logged in, or has already logged out from the vulnerable Jportal site.
*   **Ability to Craft Requests:** The attacker must be able to craft a specific HTTP GET or POST request with the necessary parameters to create an administrator user.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided exploit example shows how the attacker can set the username to "admin", password to "pass" and elevate the created user to root level: `http://vulnerable_jportal/admin.php?op=admin&name=admin&mail=&nick_=admin&_pass=pass&pass_=haslo&acce%5Broot%5D=t&ok=dodaj&goto=&cmd=add`
*   The CXSecurity report gives this CVE a CVSS base score of 9.3/10, due to the ability to gain full control of the application.
