      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-0515",
      "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Word. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when Word parses a file and processes a malformed function. Such a specially crafted file might be included as an e-mail attachment or hosted on a malicious web site. Viewing or previewing a malformed e-mail message in an affected version of Outlook could not lead to exploitation of this vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Word file that could allow remote code execution.",
      "root_cause": "Word does not perform sufficient data validation when processing the contents of a file. When Word opens a specially crafted Word file and parses a malformed function, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient data validation",
        "Memory corruption"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. They could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited through a specially crafted Word file, which could be delivered as an email attachment or hosted on a malicious website. The user must open the malicious document to be exploited.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted Word file with a malformed function to trigger the vulnerability. They also need to convince a user to open the malicious file.",
