```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the "Client-IP" header.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, in this case, usernames and passwords.
- Attack vectors: By injecting malicious SQL code into the "Client-IP" HTTP header.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a modified "Client-IP" header to the vulnerable web server.
