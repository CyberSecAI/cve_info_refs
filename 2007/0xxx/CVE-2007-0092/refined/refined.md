Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0092:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `product_id` parameter of the `productdetail.asp` page in E-Smart Cart 1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the `product_id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication, and potentially read sensitive data directly from the database.
- The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database. This can lead to data breaches, data modification, or denial of service attacks.
- In this specific example, the attacker can retrieve email addresses and user passwords from the `users` table.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `productdetail.asp` page.
- The attacker manipulates the `product_id` parameter to inject SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required.

**More Details:**
- The exploit-db entry provides the specific vulnerable URL and example SQL injection payloads, demonstrating the vulnerability.
- Specifically the payloads:
    - `//productdetail.asp?p=1&subcat_id=-1&category_id=-1&product_id=-1%20union%20select%200,email,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0%20from%20users` retrieves email addresses from the users table.
    - `//productdetail.asp?p=1&subcat_id=-1&category_id=-1&product_id=-1%20union%20select%200,userpassword,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0%20from%20users` retrieves user passwords.
