Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0624:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `index.php` script of MDPro 1.0.76. This occurs within the `News` module, specifically related to the `startrow` parameter.

*   A secondary vulnerability is the exposure of the script's path through the `user.php` script via the `uname` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `index.php?module=News&startrow='[sql injection]` demonstrates a classic SQL injection vulnerability. User-supplied input is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in an SQL query.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `user.php?op=userinfo&uname='` reveals the path to the script, which could aid in further attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Successful SQL injection could lead to a range of severe impacts:
    *   **Data Breach:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials, personal information, and other confidential data.
    *   **Data Modification:** Malicious actors could modify or delete data in the database.
    *   **Denial of Service:** SQL injection could be used to overload the database server, causing a denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Complete System Compromise:** In some cases, SQL injection can be leveraged to gain control of the entire system hosting the application.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The exposure of script paths can help attackers understand the application's structure and could be used as a stepping stone for more advanced attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** Both vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vectors use HTTP GET requests with crafted parameters in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable MDPro application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** For the SQL injection vulnerability, the attacker must have knowledge of SQL to craft malicious SQL queries.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how web applications handle requests and parameters.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by "adex".
*   The severity is rated as "High".
