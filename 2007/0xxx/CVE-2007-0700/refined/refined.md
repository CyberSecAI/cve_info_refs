  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to both local and remote file inclusion due to insecure handling of user-supplied parameters.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, leading to information disclosure or arbitrary code execution. They can also include remote files, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request to /index.php with a manipulated 'page' parameter for LFI",
       "HTTP GET request to /includes/includes.php with a manipulated 'site_path' parameter for RFI",
       "HTTP GET request to /template/Vert/index.php, /template/Noir/index.php, or /template/Bleu/index.php with a manipulated 'site_path' parameter for RFI"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. For RFI the attacker also needs to host a malicious file on a remote server."
