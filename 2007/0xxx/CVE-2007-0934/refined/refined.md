  "vulnerability_information": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-0934",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because Microsoft Visio does not correctly validate the version number field when processing version-related data of a file.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system, potentially leading to complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",

        "Email attachment: A specially crafted Visio file could be sent as an email attachment.",

      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-0936",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the way Microsoft Visio incorrectly handles the parsing of packed objects within the Visio file format, leading to memory corruption.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of packed objects",
           "Memory corruption"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",

           "Email attachment: A specially crafted Visio file could be sent as an email attachment.",
