- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application includes a file specified by user-supplied input without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `index.php` file includes a file path from the `AML_opensite` GET parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The vulnerability exists because the application includes a file based on user-controlled input, which allows an attacker to include a malicious file from a remote server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server by including a malicious file located on a server they control.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request. The attacker injects a malicious URL in the `AML_opensite` parameter. For example: `/index.php?AML_opensite=[Ev!L_Scr!pT]`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. They also need a server to host their malicious file.
