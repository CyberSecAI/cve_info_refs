Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the Macrovision FLEXnet Connect Software Manager DWUpdateService ActiveX control. This control contains methods (`Execute()` and `GetExitCode()`) that do not restrict access, allowing arbitrary program execution with user privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unrestricted Method Access:** The core issue is the lack of access control on the `Execute()` and `GetExitCode()` methods of the ActiveX control.
*   **ActiveX Control Vulnerability:**  The ActiveX control, designed for software updates, is exposed in a way that it can be abused.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTML Documents:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into viewing a specially crafted HTML document, such as a web page, HTML email message, or attachment. This document would leverage the vulnerable ActiveX control to execute malicious commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the system and can launch the attack remotely.
*   **Ability to create malicious HTML:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious HTML document and deliver it to a victim.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable control may be present due to the installation of the FLEXnet Connect SDK, other InstallShield software, or FLEXnet Connect-enabled Windows software.
*   The CERT/CC vulnerability note highlights that the vulnerable control can be disabled via a "kill bit" in Internet Explorer
*   Multiple vendors such as Earthlink and RIM (BlackBerry) were also affected by this vulnerability, as they bundled the vulnerable control within their products.
*   A patch was released by Macrovision in their FLEXnet Connect 6.0 SDK, but given the ubiquity of the vulnerable control and the potential for it to exist on systems without the full SDK installed, workarounds such as disabling the ActiveX control were suggested.
