  "CVE-2007-0220": {
    "Description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Microsoft Exchange in the way that Outlook Web Access (OWA) handles script-based attachments. An attached script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take within the context of the OWA session.",
    "Root cause": "An incorrectly handled UTF character set label in Outlook Web Access could allow unauthorized scripts to run.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of UTF character set labels",
      "Lack of sufficient input sanitization when processing script-based attachments"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary script code within the security context of an OWA user. This could lead to information disclosure, spoofing, and other actions that the user can perform within the OWA session (e.g., manipulating messages and folders).",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted email with a script-based attachment. The user must open this attachment within an authenticated OWA session to trigger the vulnerability.",
        "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the target user and convince them to open a specially crafted file within OWA. An attacker needs to create an attachment with a malicious script and send it to the target, then have the target open the attachment within an authenticated OWA session."
