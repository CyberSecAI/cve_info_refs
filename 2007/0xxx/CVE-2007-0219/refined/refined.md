  "CVE-2007-0219": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer instantiates COM objects that are not intended to be instantiated in Internet Explorer.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises when Internet Explorer attempts to instantiate certain Component Object Model (COM) objects as ActiveX controls. This instantiation can lead to memory corruption, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper instantiation of COM objects as ActiveX controls",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, potentially taking complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new user accounts with full user rights. A denial-of-service condition is also possible.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted websites designed to trigger the vulnerability when loaded in Internet Explorer.",
      "Websites accepting or hosting user-provided content.",
       "Compromised websites or advertisement servers that host malicious content"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious web page and persuade a user to visit it. This can be achieved via methods like embedding the link in an email or instant message, or by using other methods to deliver web content, like banner advertisements.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered by attempting to instantiate specific COM objects found in `Msb1fren.dll`, `Htmlmm.ocx`, or `Blnmgrps.dll`. Windows Internet Explorer 7 in Windows Vista is not affected by this vulnerability. The vulnerability is addressed by setting the kill bit for the affected COM objects' CLSIDs, preventing their instantiation in Internet Explorer."
