The provided content relates to CVE-2007-0346.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `us` (username) and `ps` (password) parameters from the POST request are directly embedded into the SQL query without any escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection vulnerability is present in `index.php` of SMe FileMailer 1.21. The vulnerability occurs due to the direct inclusion of user-controlled parameters `$_POST['us']` and `$_POST['ps']` into the SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can manipulate the SQL query through the `us` and `ps` parameters, allowing them to bypass authentication, potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify or delete data, or even gain control of the database server itself.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is via HTTP POST requests to the `index.php` file with specially crafted `us` and `ps` parameters designed to manipulate the SQL query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `index.php` file. No special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
