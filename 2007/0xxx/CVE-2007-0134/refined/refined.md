Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The primary vulnerability lies in the insecure use of the `eval()` function in `cart.php` and `page.php`. The `action` parameter in the HTTP GET request is directly incorporated into an `eval()` statement without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code into the execution context.
- Additionally, a SQL injection vulnerability exists in `compare_product.php` due to the lack of proper quoting of the `id` parameter in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The `eval()` usage in `cart.php` and `page.php` allows for arbitrary PHP code execution.
2.  **SQL Injection:** The `compare_product.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing attackers to manipulate SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **RCE:**  Successful exploitation of the `eval()` vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This could lead to complete compromise of the web application and the server itself, including data theft, denial of service, and malware deployment.  The provided examples demonstrate how attackers can dump credit card numbers and user login information from the database.
2.  **SQL Injection:** Exploitation of SQL injection in `compare_product.php` allows the attacker to retrieve sensitive data from the database. While the provided example demonstrates a simple union query, more complex attacks can be crafted to exfiltrate data, modify data, or even gain control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The RCE vulnerabilities are exploitable via HTTP GET requests to `cart.php` and `page.php`, by manipulating the `action` parameter.
    - Example: `http://127.0.0.1/ig_shop/cart.php?action=;phpinfo();//`
-   The SQL Injection vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP GET requests to `compare_product.php`, by manipulating the `id` parameter.
    - Example: `http://127.0.0.1/ig_shop/compare_product.php?id=1 union select 1`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges or authentication is required to exploit these vulnerabilities

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was present in ig shop version 1.0
- The exploit for the RCE is referenced as milw0rm ID 3083, and the code execution due to eval can be used to dump credit cards and user login details.
- The identified SQL injection is effective regardless of magic_quotes_gpc setting.
