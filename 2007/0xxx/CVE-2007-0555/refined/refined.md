{
  "CVE-2007-0555": {
    "Description": "PostgreSQL was found to contain two vulnerabilities in its processing of SQL functions. An authenticated user with permissions to add and drop database tables could potentially exploit these issues to cause the PostgreSQL server process to crash or possibly read data frorm arbitrary memory locations.",
    "Root cause": "PostgreSQL performs insufficient type checking for SQL function arguments, and also doesn't check format of tables in query planner.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient type checking",
      "Improper table format handling"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (server crash), information disclosure (read data from memory).",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted SQL queries",
      "SQL commands"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An authenticated user with permissions to add and drop database tables can exploit these issues. Also, an authenticated user can use specific SQL commands."
