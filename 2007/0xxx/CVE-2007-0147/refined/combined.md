### Cuyahoga news

#### Cuyahoga 1.0.1 released

Just before the first major new release of Cuyahoga we released an update for Cuyahoga 1.0. The main reason for this release is a security issue that was found in FCKeditor where it was possible for unauthorized users to upload files.

Many thanks to Dieu Quan for mentioning the issue.

A complete overview of the fixes can be found in the [Release notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=153246&release_id=476128). You can download the source or binary packages from [here](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=153246&package_id=169765&release_id=476128).

To just fix the FCKeditor security issue, get [this Web.config file](/UserFiles/File/FCKeditor-Web.config.zip) and place it in the /Support/FCKeditor/editor/filemanager/ directory of your web site. This Web.config file ensures that only authenticated users with the Administrator or Editor role can view and upload files with FCKeditor.

It's highly recommended to upgrade to the new version or apply the Web.config fix!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
