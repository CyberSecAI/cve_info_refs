Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-0870:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Word handles a specially crafted Word Document stream. Specifically, insufficient validation is performed when processing objects within a Word Document stream, which can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:**  The lack of proper validation when handling the document stream leads to memory corruption. This corrupted memory can be leveraged by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the user who opened the document.
- **System Compromise:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, including the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Document:** The attack is triggered by opening a specially crafted Word document. This could be achieved through:
    - **Email Attachments:** The attacker sends the malicious document as an email attachment, convincing the user to open it.
    - **Web-Based Attacks:** The attacker hosts the malicious document on a website. Users would then need to be persuaded to visit this website and open the document. Compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content could also be exploited for this purpose.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Crafting Malicious Document:** The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted Word document containing the malformed stream.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must be able to convince the victim to open the malicious document, either through email or by visiting a compromised website.
- **No special privileges:** The attacker does not need prior access or specific privileges on the victim's system.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Microsoft Word 2000, XP, and 2003, as well as the Word Viewer 2003 and Microsoft Works Suites.
- Microsoft Word 2007 is not affected by this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was being actively exploited at the time Microsoft released the security bulletin (MS07-024).
- The vulnerability is also known as Word Document Stream Vulnerability.
