Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0585:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `debug.php` file of the Webfwlog application. Specifically, the code includes a line `readfile("$conffile");` which directly reads and outputs the contents of a file specified by the `$conffile` variable. This variable is taken directly from user input via a GET parameter without proper sanitization, leading to a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. The exploit relies on `register_globals` being set to 'on' in php.ini.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary weakness is the ability to include and display the content of arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a `readfile()` function, allowing for path traversal.
*   **Reliance on PHP Configuration:** The vulnerability relies on the outdated and insecure practice of having `register_globals` enabled in the PHP configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to read the contents of sensitive files on the server including configuration files like `config.php` which may contain database credentials, or other secret keys.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `debug.php`.
*   **Manipulation of Parameters:** The attacker manipulates the `conffile` parameter to specify the path of the file to read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Knowledge of Application Paths:** The attacker should know or be able to guess the path to the target file, such as `config.php` to gain more critical information.
*   **Target System Configuration:** For the vulnerability to be exploitable the target PHP server must have the `register_globals` setting enabled.

**More Detail Than CVE Description:**

The provided content from Exploit-DB gives more detail than a standard CVE description would, including:

*   Specific vulnerable code: `/include/debug.php | php.ini -> register globals = on` and `readfile("$conffile");`
*   The vulnerable application is `webfwlog 0.92`
*   A sample exploit URL: `/include/debug.php?config[debug]=10&conffile=config.php`
*   Additional information: The need for `register_globals` to be on

This exploit allows for arbitrary file disclosure of configuration files and other sensitive data, due to lack of sanitization on user-provided filepaths.
