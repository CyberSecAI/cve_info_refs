      "vulnerable_application": "Total Video Player 1.20",
      "vulnerability_type": "Stack Buffer Overflow",
      "root_cause": "The application does not properly handle long strings within a .m3u file, leading to a stack buffer overflow.",

        "Improper bounds checking when parsing .m3u files",
         "Lack of sufficient stack protection"

      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution via stack corruption. The exploit can be used to spawn calc.exe or bind a port and spawn a shell.",
      "attack_vector": "Local",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious .m3u file and have the user open it with the vulnerable application.",
       "additional_information": "The exploit overwrites EBP and EIP registers. ESP points exactly after the return address position. The provided exploit code includes shellcode for both calc.exe spawning and port binding."

      "additional_information": "The exploit corrupts the stack, overwriting a SEH handler. Control of ECX is gained after ~800 bytes, EIP after 849 bytes. The exploit offers various return addresses from the program's DLLs and universal addresses, along with shellcode for both calc.exe spawning and port binding."
