- Complete control of the affected system: If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take full control, install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full privileges.
- For users with fewer privileges, the impact could be less severe.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Specially crafted web page: An attacker could host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- HTML email: An attacker could send an HTML email containing malicious code.
- Compromised websites: Malicious content could be injected into legitimate websites.
- Banner advertisements: Specially crafted content could be displayed through malicious ads.
- Any method to deliver web content to affected systems.
