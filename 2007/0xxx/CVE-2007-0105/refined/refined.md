Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0105:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the CSAdmin web server component of Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS). This occurs during the handling of specially crafted HTTP GET requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The vulnerability lies in how the CSAdmin server processes input from HTTP GET requests, which can lead to overwriting memory on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the CSAdmin server.
- Denial of service (DoS): Exploiting the vulnerability can cause the CSAdmin service to crash, making the web administrative interface unavailable. This requires a manual restart of the service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via a network connection.
- Unauthenticated access: An attacker does not require authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- Crafted HTTP GET request: The attack is carried out by sending a specifically crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable web server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker must have network connectivity to reach the vulnerable server.
- Ability to craft HTTP GET request: The attacker must be able to create and send a malicious HTTP GET request that triggers the buffer overflow.

**Additional details:**
- Affected Products: Cisco Secure Access Control Server for Windows and Cisco Secure Access Control Server Solution Engine versions prior to 4.1
- Workarounds: Cisco provided workarounds along with software updates to mitigate the vulnerability.
- Public disclosure: The vulnerability was publicly reported in the Cisco Security Advisory cisco-sa-20070105-csacs.
