  "CVE-2007-0215": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Excel handles files with malformed BIFF records. Such a file might be included in an e-mail attachment or hosted on a malicious Web site. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Excel file that could allow remote code execution.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by Excel not correctly handling Excel files with malformed BIFF records, which could result in the corruption of memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of malformed BIFF records leading to memory corruption."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user who opened the file, potentially leading to complete system compromise if the user has administrative rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Email attachments: An attacker sends a specially crafted Excel file as an email attachment and convinces the user to open it.",
      "Web-based attacks: An attacker hosts a website containing a malicious Excel file, or compromises a legitimate website to host it, and convinces a user to visit the site and open the file."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Excel file with malformed BIFF records and convince a user to open it. No other specific capabilities are mentioned. They can be a remote attacker."
