1.  RELATED: The provided content relates to CVE-2007-0008

2.  Relevant content found:
    - Root cause of vulnerability: Buffer overflow in the NSS (Mozilla Network Security Services) code related to processing the SSLv2 protocol.
    - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The NSS library contains a vulnerability in the way malformed SSLv2 server messages related to the public key are handled that may result in a buffer overflow. Specifically, SSL clients can suffer a buffer overflow if a malicious server presents a certificate with a public key that is too small to encrypt the entire "Master Secret".
    - Impact of exploitation: A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user who is running the vulnerable application or cause a denial of service.
    - Attack vectors: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to connect to a malicious server with a client-side application using NSS.
    - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to set up a malicious server that presents a certificate with a public key that is too small to encrypt the entire "Master Secret".
