Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0048:

**Verification:** The provided content from multiple sources, including us-cert, wisec.it, googlechromereleases.blogspot.com, and adobe.com, directly relates to CVE-2007-0048, describing vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader and Acrobat that can be exploited through crafted PDF files.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause lies in the way Adobe Reader and Acrobat handle certain parameters, specifically those related to FDF, XML, and XFDF fields, within PDF files. These parameters allow external data to be supplied to the PDF forms, and this functionality is improperly implemented, leading to various vulnerabilities. Specifically, the plugin is vulnerable to Universal Cross Site Scripting(UXSS) attacks via the javascript: URI handler.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By crafting a special PDF, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's system. This was made possible by improper handling of javascript, specifically causing a double free error and allowing overwrite of part of Structural Exception Handler during NP_Shutdown() call in Firefox.
*   **Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS):** The improper handling of `javascript:` URLs within FDF, XML, and XFDF parameters allows for the injection of malicious scripts that can execute within the context of the user's browser. This vulnerability affects multiple browsers, notably Firefox, but can also be used with Internet Explorer. The use of named pipes and `res://` protocol allows gaining access to internal LANs and obtaining victims credentials.
*   **Universal CSRF and Session Riding:** By using specially crafted links, attackers can automatically send requests to arbitrary sites through the FDF, XML, and XFDF parameters without user interaction, potentially leading to Universal CSRF attacks.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** In Internet Explorer, sending an excessively long string of '#' characters in a URL (e.g. `http://site.com/file.pdf#####...`) can lead to a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Allows an attacker to gain full control over a user's system.
*   **UXSS:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary javascript code on any site, potentially leading to theft of sensitive information.
*   **Universal CSRF and Session Riding:** Allows an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Denial of Service:** Renders the application unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Malicious PDF Files:**  Convincing a user to open a specially crafted PDF file through various means such as email attachments or links on a website.
*   **Malicious Links:** Luring the user to click on a specially crafted URL through emails or websites.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Knowledge of PDF structure:** An attacker needs to know how to craft a PDF that contains malicious payloads.
*   **Ability to deliver the malicious PDF:** Requires the attacker to be able to somehow get the victim to open or load the malicious PDF file. This could be via email or hosting the file on a web server.
*   **For UXSS, knowledge of vulnerable browser plugins:** Need knowledge to craft URLs exploiting plugin vulnerabilities.
*   **For Universal CSRF, ability to entice user:**  Ability to create links that will be clicked by the target user.
*   **For DoS attacks, ability to force the victim to access malicious URLs.**

**Additional Information:**
*   The wisec.it content provides more detail than the official CVE description, particularly in how it explains the underlying cause of the UXSS, CSRF, and code execution vulnerabilities.
*   The googlechromereleases.blogspot.com content mentions a specific workaround implemented in Google Chrome to mitigate javascript execution in the Adobe Reader plugin.

**In summary, CVE-2007-0048 describes a set of vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader and Acrobat that stem from improper handling of PDF parameters and javascript URI handler. Exploitation can lead to remote code execution, cross-site scripting, universal CSRF attacks, and denial of service, with attackers using malicious PDF files and URLs as attack vectors.**
