Login Manager Multiple HTML Injections
Login Manager is a powerful, robust system that enables web administrators to manage website user accounts easily, create membership protected areas, and effortlessly prevent unauthorized user access to secured areas. Login Manager 3 (?LM3?) uses PHP and MySQL for lightning fast processing. It comes with a control panel that enables an administrator to create new user accounts and new secured access areas, as well as activate/deactivate user accounts, send emails to members, and more. An attacker may leverage this issue to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
