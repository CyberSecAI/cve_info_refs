{
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how Mozilla Firefox handles character set inheritance for child frames. Specifically, if a child frame does not explicitly specify its character set, Firefox would inherit the character set of its parent window. This could be exploited in cross-site scripting attacks.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Insecure character set handling",
     "Child frame inheritance vulnerability"
  ],
  "impact": "A malicious website could craft an attack by injecting script tags into a vulnerable site encoded with UTF-7, bypassing content filters. When a user visits a malicious page containing an iframe pointing to the victim site, this script could execute within the context of the victim site, leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or session hijacking.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Malicious website hosting an iframe",
    "Vulnerable website accepting user content without specifying character set"
  ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to control a web server to host a malicious HTML page containing an iframe. They also need to find a vulnerable web application that allows arbitrary user content which doesn't specify charset in it's headers or within the HTML."
