{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `includes/config.inc.php` file where the `$racineTBS` variable is not defined before being used in include statements. This makes it possible for attackers to control the included file path through the `racineTBS` parameter in the URL.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code on the server. This could result in complete compromise of the server and the application it hosts.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `includes/config.inc.php` script, using the `racineTBS` parameter to point to a remote malicious file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to a location where they can host a malicious PHP file. No authentication is required."
