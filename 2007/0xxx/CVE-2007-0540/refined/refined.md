{
  "CVE-2007-0540": {
    "root_cause": "The WordPress pingback service downloads content from a provided URI without checking the content type.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of service due to bandwidth or thread consumption.",
      "Lack of input sanitization for the source URI which allows local file disclosure."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (bandwidth or thread consumption) by making the server download a large binary file. Additionally, an attacker can potentially disclose local files by specifying a source URI pointing to them.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending crafted pingback service calls with a source URI pointing to a large binary file or a local file, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is needed to trigger the DoS vulnerability and only a normal user account is required to access the administrative interface."
