Package        : wordpress
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-3639 CVE-2007-4153 CVE-2007-4154 CVE-2007-0540

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in wordpress,
a weblog manager. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-3639

    Insufficient input sanitising allowed for remote attackers to
    redirect visitors to external websites.

CVE-2007-4153

    Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities allowed remote
    authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2007-4154

    SQL injection vulnerability allowed allowed remote authenticated
    administrators to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

CVE-2007-0540

    WordPress allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (bandwidth or thread consumption) via pingback service calls with
    a source URI that corresponds to a file with a binary content type,
    which is downloaded even though it cannot contain usable pingback data.

[no CVE name yet]

    Insufficient input sanitising caused an attacker with a normal user
    account to access the administrative interface.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.10-1etch2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Advisory: Multiple Remote Vulnerabilities in Wordpress
Advisory ID: 4tphi-sa-20070111-wordpress
Release Date: 01-24-2007
Author: Blake Matheny (bmatheny (at) mobocracy (dot) net [email concealed])
Software: WordPress < 2.1
Impact: Remote & Local DoS, File Disclosure
Overview:
From Wikipedia, "WordPress is a blog publishing system written in PHP
and backed by a MySQL database."
Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the XMLRPC and Pingback
implementation that are included with Wordpress. Note that some issues
discovered with Pingback affect other vendors as well. Please see
the following advisory for details: 4tphi-sa-20070111-pingback
Details:
WordPress is vulnerable to the attacks described in the pingback
advisory. In testing, a single PC on a T1 connection was able to cripple
two dual Xeon apache servers on separate 100Mb connection. This was
accomplished by sending out multiple requests to server A specifying a
sourceURI on server B that was a 1GB media file. This attack utilizes
resources on server A and server B, but not the malicious users machine.
Additionally, WordPress does not sanitize the sourceURI before passing
it to wp\_remote\_fopen(); This makes it possible to specify non-HTTP
resources to be read such as local files or ftp sources. In particular, a
malicious user can determine whether certain files exist on the local file
system. For example, the following request would help determine the
version of Linux being used:
<methodCall>
<methodName>pingback.ping</methodName>
<params>
<param>
<value><string>/etc/SuSE-release</string></value>
</param>
<param>
<value><string>http://b.example.com/#p</string></value>
</param>
</params>
</methodCall>
If this file does not exist, fault 16 (source URI does not exist) will be
returned and if it does exist it is likely that fault 17 (source URI does
not contain a link to the target URI) will be returned. This works
whether curl or the fopen() stream is used, only the uri has to be
changed. This will not work if the webserver user can not read the file.
If the administrator has allowed automatic pingbacks to show up as
comments, it is possible for an attacker to have system information
display in that comment. For instance, an attacker could request a url on
the host with the following text in it:
<title>example</title><a href="valid targetURI">text</a>
If that showed up in the apache access\_log or error\_log, and the
webserver user had permission to read that file the above XMLRPC request,
after determining the OS, could specify the log as the sourceURI. This
would cause some of the log file to be displayed as a comment. The session
file for PHP would be a good target.
Recommendations:
Upgrade to Wordpress 2.1. The original recommendations made to the
Wordpress security team can be found below. Please note that Wordpress
still does not check the content type, however the timeout has been set to
10 seconds and as such the impact of binary files is minimized.
The local file issues can be resolved by ensuring that the URI scheme
is HTTP. This also disallows other resources, such as ftp, from being
read. In order to prevent overly large files from being retrieved, a
reasonable timeout for curl and fopen should be set. Also, if content is
missing a compatible Content-Type (such as text/xml) it should not be read
as it can not be parsed. The attached patch is one possible solution to
the issues described above. There are some more significant design
problems, particularly with respect to pingback authentication. These are
described in the pingback advisory and are not addressed here, as there
has been no formal specification modification yet.
Disclosure Timeline:

01-18-2007 - Response from Wordpress. Waiting on release of 2.1 to
disclose. Code base includes patch.
