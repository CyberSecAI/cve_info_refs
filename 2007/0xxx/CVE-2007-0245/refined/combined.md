### Background

OpenOffice.org is an open source office productivity suite, including
word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, drawing, data charting,
formula editing, and file conversion facilities.

### Description

John Heasman of NGSSoftware has discovered a heap-based buffer overflow
when parsing the "prdata" tag in RTF files where the first token is
smaller than the second one (CVE-2007-0245). Additionally, the
OpenOffice binary program is shipped with a version of FreeType that
contains an integer signedness error in the n\_points variable in file
truetype/ttgload.c, which was covered by GLSA 200705-22
(CVE-2007-2754).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
document, possibly leading to execution of arbitrary code with the
rights of the user running OpenOffice.org.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenOffice.org users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-2.2.1"
```

All OpenOffice.org binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-2.2.1"
```

specially crafted document, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary

code with user privileges.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 1307-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
June 12th, 2007                         <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : openoffice.org
Vulnerability  : heap overflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-0245

John Heasman discovered a heap overflow in the routines of OpenOffice.org
that parse RTF files.  A specially crafted RTF file could cause the
filter to overwrite data on the heap, which may lead to the execution
of arbitrary code.

For the old stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.3-9sarge7.

For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.4.dfsg.2-7etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.1~rc1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openoffice.org packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given at the end of this advisory:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# FreeType: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200705-22**

A vulnerability has been discovered in FreeType allowing for the execution
of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/freetype** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.3.4-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.3.4-r2**< **2.0** |

### Background

FreeType is a True Type Font rendering library.

### Description

Victor Stinner discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the function
Get\_VMetrics() in src/truetype/ttgload.c when processing TTF files with
a negative n\_points attribute.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TTF
file, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running FreeType.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All FreeType users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/freetype-2.3.4-r2"
```
### References
