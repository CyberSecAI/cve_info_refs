  "CVE-2007-0245": {
    "Description": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in OpenOffice.org when parsing the 'prdata' tag in RTF files where the first token is smaller than the second one. This could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code by enticing a user to open a specially crafted document.",
    "Root cause": "Heap-based buffer overflow when parsing the 'prdata' tag in RTF files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution with the privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted RTF file."
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to create a malicious RTF document and make it accessible to the victim. No specific network position is required."
