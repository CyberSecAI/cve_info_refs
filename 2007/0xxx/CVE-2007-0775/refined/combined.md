Loading the testcase crashes Firefox.
Filing as security-sensitive because I don't know what would happen if I set it to something other than null, but controlled by content.

Completely different stack trace from windows on 2.0.0.2pre debug, cx->fp->pc is 0xCCCCCCCC (uninitialized memory). On an opt build this could potentially grab values from recently freed memory filled by an attacker. Memory would have to be filled with values that were addresses that pointed to something that made sense as JS opcodes, exploitation might be difficult.

WFM Mac trunk debug. Should the Windows issue become a separate bug report?

I still see this on Linux, but branches only, not trunk. I've got a trivial fix for the crash I'm seeing (same stack as the mac stack trace in this bug).Status: NEW → ASSIGNED

In the case I'm seeing the crash, the target is a document, not something that successfully QIs to nsIContent.

Add null check.
Is this a branch crash only? The event listener should always be a XUL element, so why is the target of the event a document?

Add null check.
Since this is branch-only it's less important that the fix is the RightThing(tm). But it'd be good to know that things work as they should on trunk.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security bugs are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

[Updated 26 February 2007]
Packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 have been updated to correct an
issue which prevented Evolution and other applications linked against the
NSS library from functioning.

[Updated 12 March 2007]
Packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3 have been updated to
correct an issue which prevented Evolution and other applications linked
against the NSS library from functioning.

## Description

SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup
client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

Several flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey processed certain malformed
JavaScript code. A malicious web page could execute JavaScript code in such
a way that may result in SeaMonkey crashing or executing arbitrary code as
the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2007-0775, CVE-2007-0777)

Several cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey
processed certain malformed web pages. A malicious web page could display
misleading information which may result in a user unknowingly divulging
sensitive information such as a password. (CVE-2006-6077, CVE-2007-0995,
CVE-2007-0996)

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey cached web pages on the local disk. A
malicious web page may be able to inject arbitrary HTML into a browsing
session if the user reloads a targeted site. (CVE-2007-0778)

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey displayed certain web content. A
malicious web page could generate content which could overlay user
interface elements such as the hostname and security indicators, tricking a
user into thinking they are visiting a different site. (CVE-2007-0779)

Two flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey displayed blocked popup windows.
If a user can be convinced to open a blocked popup, it is possible to read
arbitrary local files, or conduct an XSS attack against the user.
(CVE-2007-0780, CVE-2007-0800)

Two buffer overflow flaws were found in the Network Security Services (NSS)
code for processing the SSLv2 protocol. Connecting to a malicious secure
web server could cause the execution of arbitrary code as the user running
SeaMonkey. (CVE-2007-0008, CVE-2007-0009)

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled the "location.hostname" value
during certain browser domain checks. This flaw could allow a malicious web
site to set domain cookies for an arbitrary site, or possibly perform an
XSS attack. (CVE-2007-0981)

Users of SeaMonkey are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
contain SeaMonkey version 1.0.8 that corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

The [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird/) email client is also a Mozilla product. These products use the Mozilla layout engine to render HTML formatted text.  The Mozilla layout engine contains multiple vulnerabilities. An attacker may be able to exploit these vulnerabilties by convincing a user to connect to a specially crafted website or viewing an HTML formatted email. For more information refer to Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory [2007-01](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2007/mfsa2007-01.html). |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2007-01

## Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.8.0.10/1.8.1.2)

Announced
February 23, 2007
Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.5.0.10
* Firefox 2.0.0.2
* SeaMonkey 1.0.8
* Thunderbird 1.5.0.10

### Description

As part of the Firefox 2.0.0.2 and 1.5.0.10 update releases we fixed
several bugs to improve the stability of the product. Some of these were
crashes that showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that
with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.

Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in
mail. This is not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from
running JavaScript in mail. Without further investigation we cannot rule out
the possibility that for some of these an attacker might be able to prepare
memory for exploitation through some means other than JavaScript, such as
large images.

### Workaround

Upgrade to the fixed versions. Do not enable JavaScript in Thunderbird
or the mail portions of SeaMonkey.

### References

Jesse Ruderman, Martijn Wargers and Olli Pettay reported crashes in
the layout engine

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=229805#c0)  Josh Bressers    2007-02-23 16:25:05 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #229802](show_bug.cgi?id=229802 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2007-0775 Multiple Firefox flaws (CVE-2007-0777, CVE-2007-0995, CVE-2007-0996, CVE-2006-6077, CVE-2007-0778, CVE-2007-0779, CVE-2007-0780, CVE-2007-0800, CVE-2007-0008, CVE-2007-0009, CVE-2007-0981)") +++  The Mozilla project is releasing Seamonkey 1.0.8 to fix several flaws:  mfsa2007-01 impact=critical,source=mozilla,reported=20070222,public=20070223      [CVE-2007-0775](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0775)     Jesse Ruderman, Martijn Wargers and Olli Pettay reported crashes in the     layout engine      [CVE-2007-0777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0777)     Brian Crowder, Igor Bukanov, Johnny Stenback, moz_bug_r_a4 and shutdown      reported potential memory corruption in the JavaScript engine  mfsa2007-02 impact=moderate,source=mozilla,reported=20070222,public=20070223      [CVE-2007-0995](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0995)     The Mozilla parser formerly ignored invalid trailing characters in HTML tag      attribute names. This could in some cases be abused to evade web sites      content filters that attempted to remove problematic attributes, such as      event handlers, by matching against a regular expression that expected to      find trailing whitespace or one of a small set of delimiters.      [CVE-2007-0996](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0996)     Stefan Esser demonstrated that this could be used for XSS attacks against     sites that accept user content and do not specify the character set or      encoding used.      [CVE-2006-6077](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-6077)     MySpace users recently suffered a phishing attack where user-created content      included a login form that appeared to be a normal MySpace login, but was      altered to submit the data to an alternate site. Because the password form      appeared on a MySpace page the Firefox password manager filled in the saved      password, lending an air of legitimacy to the form.  mfsa2007-03 impact=moderate,source=mozilla,reported=20070222,public=20070223      [CVE-2007-0778](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0778)     Aad reported that two web pages can collide in the disk cache with the      result that depending on order loaded the end of the longer document can be      appended to the shorter when the shorter is reloaded from the cache. It is      possible a determined hacker could construct a targeted attack to steal some      sensitive data from a particular web page (for example, transaction history      from a financial account). The potential victim would have to be already      logged into the targetted service (or be fooled into doing so) and then      visit the malicious site.  mfsa2007-04 impact=moderate,source=mozilla,reported=20070222,public=20070223      [CVE-2007-0779](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0779)     David Eckel reported that browser UI elements--such as the host name and      security indicators--could be spoofed by using a large, mostly transparent,      custom cursor and adjusting the CSS3 hotspot property so that the visible      part of the cursor floated outside the browser content area.  mfsa2007-05 impact=moderate,source=mozilla,reported=20070222,public=20070223      [CVE-2007-0780](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0780)     shutdown reported that if you could convince a user to open a blocked popup      you could perform a cross-site scripting attack against any site that      contains a frame whose source is a data: URL.      [CVE-2007-0800](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0800)     Michal Zalewski reported that although pages loaded from the web normally      cannot open windows containing local files, if you could convince a user to      open a blocked popup then this restriction could be bypassed.  mfsa2007-06 impact=critical,source=mozilla,reported=20070222,public=20070223      [CVE-2007-0008](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0008) [CVE-2007-0009](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0009)     iDefense has informed Mozilla about two potential buffer overflow      vulnerabilities found by researcher regenrecht in the Network Security      Services (NSS) code for processing the SSLv2 protocol.  mfsa2007-07 impact=moderate,source=mozilla,reported=20070222,public=20070223      [CVE-2007-0981](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0981)     Michal Zalewski demonstrated that setting location.hostname to a value with      embedded null characters can confuse the browsers domain checks. Setting the      value triggers a load, but the networking software reads the hostname only      up to the null character while other checks for "parent domain" start at the      right and so can have a completely different idea of what the current host      is.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=229805#c1)  Josh Bressers    2007-02-23 21:25:27 UTC  ``` These flaws are now public: <http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/known-vulnerabilities.html#firefox1.5.0.10>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=229805#c4)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-02-24 02:59:59 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below.

# SeaMonkey: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200703-08**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in SeaMonkey, some of which may
allow user-assisted arbitrary remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/seamonkey** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.1** |

| Package | **www-client/seamonkey-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.1** |

### Background

The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver
production-quality releases of code derived from the application
formerly known as the 'Mozilla Application Suite'.

### Description

Tom Ferris reported a heap-based buffer overflow involving wide SVG
stroke widths that affects SeaMonkey. Various researchers reported some
errors in the JavaScript engine potentially leading to memory
corruption. SeaMonkey also contains minor vulnerabilities involving
cache collision and unsafe pop-up restrictions, filtering or CSS
rendering under certain conditions. All those vulnerabilities are the
same as in GLSA 200703-04 affecting Mozilla Firefox.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page or
to read a specially crafted email that will trigger one of the
vulnerabilities, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code.
It is also possible for an attacker to spoof the address bar, steal
information through cache collision, bypass the local file protection
mechanism with pop-ups, or perform cross-site scripting attacks,
leading to the exposure of sensitive information, such as user
credentials.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time for all of these issues, but
most of them can be avoided by disabling JavaScript. Note that the
execution of JavaScript is disabled by default in the SeaMonkey email
client, and enabling it is strongly discouraged.

### Resolution

Users upgrading to the following release of SeaMonkey should note that
the corresponding Mozilla Firefox upgrade has been found to lose the
saved passwords file in some cases. The saved passwords are encrypted
and stored in the 'signons.txt' file of ~/.mozilla/ and we advise our
users to save that file before performing the upgrade.

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-1.1.1"
```

All SeaMonkey binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-bin-1.1.1"
```

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)

## Details

Several flaws have been found that could be used to perform Cross-site

scripting attacks. A malicious web site could exploit these to modify

the contents or steal confidential data (such as passwords) from other

opened web pages. ([CVE-2006-6077](/security/CVE-2006-6077), [CVE-2007-0780](/security/CVE-2007-0780), [CVE-2007-0800](/security/CVE-2007-0800),

[CVE-2007-0981](/security/CVE-2007-0981), [CVE-2007-0995](/security/CVE-2007-0995), [CVE-2007-0996](/security/CVE-2007-0996))

The SSLv2 protocol support in the NSS library did not sufficiently

check the validity of public keys presented with a SSL certificate. A

malicious SSL web site using SSLv2 could potentially exploit this to

execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. ([CVE-2007-0008](/security/CVE-2007-0008))

The SSLv2 protocol support in the NSS library did not sufficiently

verify the validity of client master keys presented in an SSL client

certificate. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary

code in a server application that uses the NSS library.

([CVE-2007-0009](/security/CVE-2007-0009))

Various flaws have been reported that could allow an attacker to

execute arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into

opening a malicious web page. ([CVE-2007-0775](/security/CVE-2007-0775), [CVE-2007-0776](/security/CVE-2007-0776),

[CVE-2007-0777](/security/CVE-2007-0777), [CVE-2007-1092](/security/CVE-2007-1092))

Two web pages could collide in the disk cache with the result that

depending on order loaded the end of the longer document could be

appended to the shorter when the shorter one was reloaded from the

cache. It is possible a determined hacker could construct a targeted

attack to steal some sensitive data from a particular web page. The

potential victim would have to be already logged into the targeted

service (or be fooled into doing so) and then visit the malicious

site. ([CVE-2007-0778](/security/CVE-2007-0778))

David Eckel reported that browser UI elements--such as the host name

and security indicators--could be spoofed by using custom cursor

images and a specially crafted style sheet. ([CVE-2007-0779](/security/CVE-2007-0779))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200703-04**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox, some of
which may allow user-assisted arbitrary remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.0.2** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **1.5.0.10**>= **2.0.0.2** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.0.2** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **1.5.0.10**>= **2.0.0.2** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

### Description

Tom Ferris reported a heap-based buffer overflow involving wide SVG
stroke widths that affects Mozilla Firefox 2 only. Various researchers
reported some errors in the JavaScript engine potentially leading to
memory corruption. Mozilla Firefox also contains minor vulnerabilities
involving cache collision and unsafe pop-up restrictions, filtering or
CSS rendering under certain conditions.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page
that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly leading to the
execution of arbitrary code. It is also possible for an attacker to
spoof the address bar, steal information through cache collision,
bypass the local files protection mechanism with pop-ups, or perform
cross-site scripting attacks, leading to the exposure of sensitive
information, like user credentials.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time for all of these issues, but
most of them can be avoided by disabling JavaScript.

### Resolution

Users upgrading to the following releases of Mozilla Firefox should
note that this upgrade has been found to lose the saved passwords file
in some cases. The saved passwords are encrypted and stored in the
'signons.txt' file of ~/.mozilla/ and we advise our users to save that
file before performing the upgrade.

All Mozilla Firefox 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.10"
```

All Mozilla Firefox 1.5 binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5.0.10"
```

All Mozilla Firefox 2.0 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.2"
```

All Mozilla Firefox 2.0 binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-2.0.0.2"
```

# Mozilla Thunderbird: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200703-18**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Thunderbird, some of
which may allow user-assisted arbitrary remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.10** |

| Package | **mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.10** |

### Background

Mozilla Thunderbird is a popular open-source email client from the
Mozilla Project.

### Description

Georgi Guninski reported a possible integer overflow in the code
handling text/enhanced or text/richtext MIME emails. Additionally,
various researchers reported errors in the JavaScript engine
potentially leading to memory corruption. Additionally, the binary
version of Mozilla Thunderbird includes a vulnerable NSS library which
contains two possible buffer overflows involving the SSLv2 protocol.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to read a specially crafted email that
could trigger one of the vulnerabilities, some of them being related to
Mozilla Thunderbird's handling of JavaScript, possibly leading to the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time for all of these issues, but
some of them can be avoided by disabling JavaScript. Note that the
execution of JavaScript is disabled by default and enabling it is
strongly discouraged.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-1.5.0.10"
```

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-1.5.0.10"
```

# USN-431-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

7 March 2007

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)

## Details

The SSLv2 protocol support in the NSS library did not sufficiently

check the validity of public keys presented with a SSL certificate. A

malicious SSL web site using SSLv2 could potentially exploit this to

execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. ([CVE-2007-0008](/security/CVE-2007-0008))

The SSLv2 protocol support in the NSS library did not sufficiently

verify the validity of client master keys presented in an SSL client

certificate. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary

code in a server application that uses the NSS library. ([CVE-2007-0009](/security/CVE-2007-0009))

Various flaws have been reported that could allow an attacker to execute

arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening a

malicious web page. ([CVE-2007-0775](/security/CVE-2007-0775), [CVE-2007-0776](/security/CVE-2007-0776), [CVE-2007-0777](/security/CVE-2007-0777))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* mozilla-thunderbird
  -
  1.5.0.10-0ubuntu0.6.10

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* mozilla-thunderbird
  -
  1.5.0.10-0ubuntu0.6.06

##### Ubuntu 5.10

* mozilla-thunderbird
  -
  1.5.0.10-0ubuntu0.5.10

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Thunderbird to

effect the necessary changes.

It seems like the basic problem here is that the treebody frame is adding a weak pointer to itself to a frame that's not a descendant of the primary frame for the content node for which it is a frame. (That definition allows a descendant of a wrapping scrollframe, but not a descendant of a higher ancestor.)

This fixes this crash. Groveling through the frame tree during frame destruction like this scares me a bit, though.

If we want to be safe, could we either use an nsWeakFrame or give the random other frame a strong ref to something that we also hold on to and notify when we go away?

I think the right approach is for SetScrollbarMediator to take an nsIContent\* and for nsScrollbarFrame to hold a strong ref to the content. Whenever it needs the nsIScrollbarMediator it can do a GetPrimaryFrameFor followed by a QI.

I prefer this patch. Does basically what I said above: hold a strong ref to nsIContent instead of a pointer to a frame.
I also found that there's a lurking problem with native scrollbars --- we pass the mediator (frame) pointer down to the native widget and use it from there! eek! Even worse, clearing the mediator pointer out of the scrollbar doesn't remove it from the widget! This patch fixes that too, by interposing the native scrollbar frame as a proxy mediator which does the necessary dynamic checks. The native scrollbar frame can safely clear the reference to itself when it dies.Assignee: dbaron → rocStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

Don't you need to change the QI impl for nsNativeScrollbarFrame to QI to nsIScrollbarMediator?

Hmm, yes. So the branch fix will be slightly more convoluted (SetScrollbarMediator will need to QI the mediator to nsIFrame and then get the content).

I do. Good catch. This is definitely going to need trunk baking to make sure that this doesn't break Mac, so it's not 1.8.0.9 material.

Same here.
I can confirm though that this patch fixes a crash in NativeScrollbarFrame::Hookup I just encountered.

roc, I think there is an error in the branch patch.
void nsNativeScrollbarFrame::Destroy() should probably be
NS\_IMETHOD Destroy(nsPresContext\* aPresContext) on branches.
Your intention was to hook up to frame destruction, right?

Fix the branch.
Not calling the superclass destructor would also have been a problem on trunk, except this code no longer exists on trunk.

The larger testcase causes two assertions before the scary crash:
###!!! ASSERTION: bad geometric parent: 'IsChild(aNextInFlow)', file /Users/admin/trunk/mozilla/layout/generic/nsBlockFrame.cpp, line 6090
###!!! ASSERTION: can't find deleted frame in lines: 'Error', file /Users/admin/trunk/mozilla/layout/generic/nsBlockFrame.cpp, line 5914
The smaller testcases causes those assertions plus several more:
###!!! ASSERTION: frame should be in parent's lists: 'NS\_SUCCEEDED(rv)', file /Users/admin/trunk/mozilla/layout/generic/nsBlockFrame.cpp, line 4989
###!!! ASSERTION: same old and new parent frame: 'aOldParentFrame != aNewParentFrame', file /Users/admin/trunk/mozilla/layout/generic/nsHTMLContainerFrame.cpp, line 419
###!!! ASSERTION: Null out-of-flow for placeholder?: 'outOfFlow', file /Users/admin/trunk/mozilla/layout/base/../generic/nsPlaceholderFrame.h, line 133
###!!! ASSERTION: null ptr: 'nsnull != aFrame', file /Users/admin/trunk/mozilla/layout/generic/nsFrameList.cpp, line 114
###!!! ASSERTION: Must have the out of flow in some child list: 'found', file /Users/admin/trunk/mozilla/layout/generic/nsBlockFrame.cpp, line 5008

So I can reproduce the crash on Linux... and if I just create the DOM that we should end up with statically, I see all sorts of stuff hanging out on overflow lists. That doesn't seem right to me...
roc, any idea what's happening during reflow here?

I only see one text frame hanging in the overflow-list of the float, contianing "W W Waaaaa", but that may be because of font size differences. Anyway that's definitely a bad bug, something is going wrong with the combination of column balancing and floats ... somehow the last column is saying it's complete when the float actually isn't.
I have to check out of the hotel now, but I'll look into this more later.Assignee: nobody → roc

OK, the problem is that the float is a below-current-line float and when nsBlockReflowState::PlaceBelowCurrentLineFloats places an incomplete float, it doesn't propagate incompleteness up the call chain to signal the parent is incomplete.

This fixes the leftover overflow and the crashes. There's an error in the computation of the available height when we reflow a float in a block which has border or padding, because we look at the wrong box edge.

It scares me that memory safety depends on width/height arithmetic being correct here. Can you file a followup bug on fixing that?

The crashes happen when a frame gets left in an overflow-list and then gets removed from the frame tree altogether (although it's still linked as the next-in-flow for some other frame). We should be able to prevent this, so that leaving frames in an overflow-list means stuff is not displayed but otherwise doesn't cause problems.

Attached patch

[defense in depth](attachment.cgi?id=246106&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=246106&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=359371&attachment=246106)

Here's a fix that prevents crashes even without fixing the geometry here.
Here's the situation:
-- Float placeholder continuation gets pushed to an overflow list when there isn't enough room in the columns to fit all of the float given a height constraint on all columns
-- We reflow the columns again, reflowing the last column with unconstrained height this time (happens as part of the column balancing strategy)
-- In DrainOverflowLines for the last column, we can't pull back the placeholder continuation because we already a placeholder for that float in this block frame. So it goes to our mOverflowPlaceholders
Then there are two things that can go wrong. #1:
-- Some other bug causes the float to not reflow completely, so the placeholder continuation is not destroyed but stays in mOverflowPlaceholders
-- In nsBlockFrame::Reflow, because this is an unconstrained height reflow we don't look at mOverflowPlaceholders to see if there are frames to be dealt with, we assume it's empty. So the frames just drop out of the frame tree. Bad.
#2:
-- The float continuation was pushed up from some descendant block because the descendant block completed but there was still float content that didn't fit in the height constraint
-- Now the original float completes and we try to delete the float continuation. nsBlockFrame::DoRemoveFrame looks up a frame property to find the currently active mOverflowPlaceholders list where the frame is living temporarily. But because the reflow is unconstrained-height, nsBlockReflowState's constructor didn't set up the frame property that poitns to mOverflowPlaceholders.
-- Frame is not removed, hilarity ensues.
The patch fixes #1 by ensuring that we always deal with mOverflowPlaceholders frames even in unconstrained-height reflows. It fixed #2 by setting up the property for mOverflowPlaceholders if that list is non-empty or it might become nonempty because height is constrained.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-1282 CVE-2007-0994 CVE-2007-0995 CVE-2007-0996 CVE-2007-0981 CVE-2007-0008 CVE-2007-0009 CVE-2007-0775 CVE-2007-0778 CVE-2007-0045 CVE-2006-6077

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox.

This will be the last security update of Mozilla-based products for
the oldstable (sarge) distribution of Debian. We recommend to upgrade
to stable (etch) as soon as possible.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:

CVE-2007-1282

    It was discovered that an integer overflow in text/enhanced message
    parsing allows the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0994

    It was discovered that a regression in the Javascript engine allows
    the execution of Javascript with elevated privileges.

CVE-2007-0995

    It was discovered that incorrect parsing of invalid HTML characters
    allows the bypass of content filters.

CVE-2007-0996

    It was discovered that insecure child frame handling allows cross-site
    scripting.

CVE-2007-0981

    It was discovered that Firefox handles URI withs a null byte in the
    hostname insecurely.

CVE-2007-0008

    It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the NSS code allows the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0009

    It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the NSS code allows the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0775

    It was discovered that multiple programming errors in the layout engine
    allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0778

    It was discovered that the page cache calculates hashes in an insecure
    manner.

CVE-2006-6077

    It was discovered that the password manager allows the disclosure of
    passwords.

For the oldstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-2sarge17. You should upgrade to etch as soon as possible.

The stable distribution (etch) isn't affected. These vulnerabilities have
been fixed prior to the release of Debian etch.
