Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0824:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the `inhalt.php` script of LightRO CMS 1.0. Specifically, the script directly includes the value of the `dateien[news]` parameter without any validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. The `include $dateien['news'];` line in `inhalt.php` allows an attacker to specify a remote URL containing malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation enables the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including:
    - Complete compromise of the server
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the website
    - Installation of malware

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability via an HTTP GET request by manipulating the `dateien[news]` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must be aware of the `dateien[news]` parameter within `inhalt.php` and understand how to manipulate it.
- **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker must host a malicious PHP file on a server accessible to the vulnerable server.
