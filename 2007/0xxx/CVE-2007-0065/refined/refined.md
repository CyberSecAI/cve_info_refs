Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-0065

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a heap overrun in OLE Automation. Specifically, it occurs due to a flaw in how OLE Automation handles memory requests when processing specially crafted script requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Overrun:** A heap overrun vulnerability exists within the OLE Automation component. This vulnerability can be triggered by malformed script requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can take complete control of the system.
- **System Compromise:** An attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
