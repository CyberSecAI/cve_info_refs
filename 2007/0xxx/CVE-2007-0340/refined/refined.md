          "root_cause": "SQL injection vulnerability in `/inc/header.inc.php` via the `board[styleid]` parameter. The application does not sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, leading to SQL injection. Additionally, the styletemplate value from the database is used to include local files, leading to command execution.",
          "weaknesses": [
            "SQL Injection",
            "Improper Input Validation",
             "Arbitrary File Inclusion",
             "Code Injection"
          ],
          "impact": "Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, disclose sensitive information (including admin usernames, session IDs, and user password hashes), and execute arbitrary code on the server via the arbitrary file inclusion.",
          "attack_vectors": "HTTP POST requests with a crafted `board[styleid]` parameter to `index.php`. The session ID can be stolen via SQL injection, then used to inject code into the mail template, resulting in command execution. The attacker exploits the `styletemplate` to include the modified mail template, which executes arbitrary code.",
          "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. Basic understanding of SQL injection and HTTP requests is required."
