Original Release Date: 2007-02-13 | Last Revised: 2007-02-13

---

### Overview

The Aruba Mobility Controller Management Interface contains a buffer overflow. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The Aruba Mobility Controllers are used to process and control network traffic in a wireless network. The Aruba Mobility Controller Management Interface is a utility used to configure and manage the Aruba Mobility Controllers. The management interface can be accessed via a command line or a web-based interface.  The Aruba Mobility Controller Management Interface fails to properly handle malformed input allowing a buffer overflow to occur. If the Aruba Mobility Controller Management Interface is configured for remote management, this vulnerability can be triggered remotely.According to Aruba Networks this vulnerability affects Aruba Networks Mobility Controllers (200, 800, 2400, and 6000) running software versions 2.0 and later and Alcatel-Lucent OmniAccess Wireless 43xx and 6000 running software versions 2.0 and later. |
