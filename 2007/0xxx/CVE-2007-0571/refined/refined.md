Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) issue in the `lib_head.php` file of PHPMyReports 3.0.11.
*   The `lib_head.php` file includes another PHP file using a variable `$cfgPathModule` which is taken from user input. This allows an attacker to control which file is included.
*   Specifically, the vulnerable line is: `<?php require "$cfgPathModule/my_javascript_inc.php"; ?>`

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application allows the inclusion of remote files, which can be a source of malicious code execution.
*   **Unsanitized User Input:** The `$cfgPathModule` variable is taken directly from user input (via the URL) without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including a malicious file, the attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server hosting the application. This could lead to complete compromise of the server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending an HTTP GET request to the `lib_head.php` file, with a malicious URL passed as a parameter in the `cfgPathModule` variable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   The attacker needs access to a malicious file they can include (e.g. hosted on a server they control).
*   No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Exploit Example:**

*   `[path]/include/lib/lib_head.php?cfgPathModule=Evil.txt?`
    *   In this example, `Evil.txt` would be a malicious PHP file hosted on a server controlled by the attacker.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes the download link for the vulnerable application which can be helpful for testing and research.
*   The exploit was reported on `milw0rm.com` on 2007-01-27.
