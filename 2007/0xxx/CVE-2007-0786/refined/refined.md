Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0786:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `view.php` script of Photo Galerie Standard versions 1.1 and earlier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `id` parameter in the `view.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach/Exposure:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, potentially including usernames, passwords, and other confidential information.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By leveraging functions like `load_file()`, an attacker might be able to read local files from the server file system that the web server process has access to, potentially containing sensitive system information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via HTTP requests.
- **Direct SQL Injection:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes SQL code injected into the `id` parameter of `view.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Basic SQL knowledge:** The attacker must have knowledge of SQL syntax to craft effective injection payloads.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides a concrete example of an attack by using a `UNION SELECT` statement with the `load_file()` function to read the `/etc/passwd` file.
*   The vulnerability is present in Photo Galerie Standard version 1.1 and potentially older versions.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the `view.php` script, specifically through the `id` URL parameter.
