Hi,

The vulnerability is there... pValid simply verifies that the page you
requested is the page being displayed, so I need to call my malware the same
as status.php or any of the other files found to be linked inside the PHP.

<snip>
 $p = $_REQUEST['p'];
 if( !$p ) $p="$cfg->defaultPage";
</snip>

<snip>
    <?php
    if( $pValid ) {
        include "$p";
    } else {
        print "<div class=warning>$p is not a valid page...</div>";
    }
    ?>
</snip>

Hash: SHA1
I - TITLE
Security advisory: Arbitrary file disclosure vulnerability in
php rrd browser (prb)
II - SUMMARY
Description: Arbitrary file disclosure vulnerability in
php rrd browser < 0.2.1
Author: Sebastian Wolfgarten (sebastian at wolfgarten dot com),
http://www.devtarget.org
Date: February 11th, 2007
Severity: Medium
References: http://www.devtarget.org/prb-advisory-02-2007.txt
III - OVERVIEW
Quote from sourceforge.net: "Prb stands for php rrd browser, inspired by
rrdbrowse and cacti. A modular framework for creating rrd databases,
updating and graphing data, based on apache, php, mysql and rrdtool. It
will allow you to graph just about anything you like". More information
about the product can be found online at http://prb.sourceforge.net.
IV - DETAILS
Due to inproper input validation, the web application "php rrd browser"
(versions <0.2.1) is vulnerable to an arbitrary file disclosure
vulnerability. It allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to read any
file on the remote system if the user the webserver is running as has
permissions to do so. Thus an attacker is able to gain access
potentially sensitive information.
V - EXPLOIT CODE
The vulnerability is trivial to exploit and only requires specifying an
URL with a relative file path on the remote system such as
http://$target/prb/www/?p=../../../../../../../etc/passwd
As the input to the "p" parameter is not validated in any way accessing
this URL will expose the contents of /etc/passwd to a remote attacker.
VI - WORKAROUND/FIX
To address this problem, the author of prb (Guillaume Fontaine) has
released an updated version (0.2.1) of the software which is available
at http://prb.sourceforge.net. Hence all users of prb are asked to test
and install this version as soon as possible.
VII - DISCLOSURE TIMELINE
07. February 2007 - Notified vendor
10. Feburary 2007 - Patch released
11. February 2007 - Public disclosure
