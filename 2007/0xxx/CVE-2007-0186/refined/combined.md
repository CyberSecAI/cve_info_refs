How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  Details

XSS vulnerability on main FirePass logon page (xcho)

A  cross-site  scripting  vulnerability  was  identified  in  the  main  logon  page,  my.logon.php3.
The  URL  contains  two  key  parameters:  crs  and  xcho.  The  xcho  parameter  is  a  Rot13
encoded message that is displayed in the logout page and the crs parameter is a CRC32 hash
value.  If  the  value  of  the  crs  parameter  does  not  match  the  CRC32  of  the  decoded  xcho
value, then the message is not displayed. However, if the hash value does match, the user-
supplied xcho parameter is decoded and displayed in the page. An attacker simply needs to
Rot13 encode the script to be executed, compute the CRC32 value, and send the resulting
URL to a logged-in user.

Multiple XSS vulnerabilities within administration console

The  system’s  Global  Customization  page  (/vdesk/admincon/index.php?a=per)  does  not
properly  filter  input  for  Custom  colors  (topblue,  midblue,  wtopblue,  etc.)  or  Front  Door
custom text colors (h321, h311, h312, etc.) values.

The  New  Browsers  page  (/vdesk/admincon/index.php?a=bro)  does  not  properly  filter
input for the User Agent (ua) value.

The  Launch  Applications  page  (/vdesk/admincon/webyfiers.php)  does  not  properly  filter
input for the App Path (app_name) and Parameters (app_param) values.

These findings are contained within the FirePass administration module. Scripts injected via
these  values  are  persistent  on  the  page  and  will  repeatedly  execute  in  an  administrator’s
browser until manually removed.

XSS with double eval() Javascript and FP_DO_NOT_TOUCH tags

By calling JavaScript that performs a double eval(), arbitrary JavaScript could be executed in
the  client’s  browser  in  a  reverse-proxy  scenario.  Eval()  functions  are  re-written  by  the
FirePass  engine,  but  double  eval()  functions  are
ignored.  Any  JavaScript  within
<FP_DO_NOT_TOUCH>  tags  is  also  ignored,  bypassing  the  anti-XSS  mechanism
implemented by the FirePass.

XSS vulnerability on main FirePass activation page (vhost)

An XSS  vulnerability has  been identified  in the vhost parameter of   the my.activation.php3
logon page.

LDAP authentication information leak

identified

information  disclosure  vulnerability  was

An
the  activation  page  -
my.activation.php3. When a user attempts to login to the system but fails to provide proper
credentials, the system will return the error message "Either Username or Password do not match!
Please try again." If the username provided exists in the LDAP (i.e., the user is authorized to
access the FirePass), the message will display the word "password" in lowercase. However, if
the username provided does not exist in the LDAP, the word “Password” is displayed in the
error message in uppercase.

ACL Filter bypass with URL de-normalization

FirePass either applies its blacklist filtering rules before URL canonicalization, or its
canonicalization routines are simply not sufficient. Therefore, one can bypass filters and
access restricted URLs by using one or more of the following techniques (assuming the
blacklist “Deny” filter exists for “site.com/path/file.html”).

a) place a trailing NULL byte after the requested URL (e.g. /path/file.html%00)
b) place two or more slashes in the URL (e.g. //path/file.html)
c) encode all or part of the request in Unicode (e.g. /path/%66%69%6C%65.html)
d) use simple directory traversal techniques (e.g. /blah/%2e%2e/path/file.html)
e) use even more simple directory techniques (e.g. /%2e/path/file.html)
f) capitalize a letter in the domain (e.g. site.coM/path/file.html)

Filter bypass with dword-encoded IP address

Authenticated  users  can  easily  evade  host  access  restrictions  by  converting  the  destination
server’s  IP  address  to  a  dword-encoded  format  and  sending  the  resulting  URL  via  the
FirePass  URL  encoding  mechanism.  Among  other  possibilities,  this  vulnerability  allows
remote users to access the FirePass administrator console if the requested URL is a dword-
encoded  form  of  the  FirePass’  own  localhost  address.  For  example,  after  logging  into  the
requesing  “http://site.com/vdesk/admincon”  or
FirePass  as  a  normal  end-user,
requesting
will
“http://127.0.0.1/vdesk/admincon”

“http://16909060/vdesk/admincon”  will  grant  access  to  the  console  (attacker  must  still
authenticate).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
