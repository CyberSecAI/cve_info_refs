```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Hailboards application includes a file using a variable called 'phpbb_root_path' which is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include a remote file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution on the server by including malicious PHP code from a remote server
- Attack vectors: By manipulating the 'phpbb_root_path' parameter in the URL of a vulnerable script.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server and have a server to host the malicious PHP code.
