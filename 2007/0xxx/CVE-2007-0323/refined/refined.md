          "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Internet Explorer, including COM object instantiation memory corruption, uninitialized memory corruption, property memory corruption, HTML objects memory corruption, and an arbitrary file rewrite vulnerability.",
           "weaknesses": [
            "Memory corruption due to improper COM object instantiation.",
            "Accessing uninitialized memory.",
             "Improper handling of property methods leading to memory corruption.",

          "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploits these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system, allowing them to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with the same user rights as the logged-on user.",
          "attack_vectors": "Specially crafted web pages or HTML content delivered through various means, including email, instant messages, or compromised websites.",
          "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious web page or open a malicious HTML document. An administrative user account can lead to complete system compromise. Knowledge of specific vulnerabilities to craft exploits."
