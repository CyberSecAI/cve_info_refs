    "relevant_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper input validation in the 'news_page.asp' script allows for SQL injection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data disclosure, modification, or deletion. In this specific case, it allows retrieving user credentials.",
       "attack_vectors": [
         "HTTP GET request with a maliciously crafted 'uid' parameter in the 'news_page.asp' script."
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable page. No authentication or specific user privileges are required.",
        "additional_information": "The provided exploit code demonstrates how to extract usernames and passwords from the 'users' table by using a crafted SQL injection query with a UNION SELECT statement. The vulnerable parameter 'uid' within 'news_page.asp' is directly injected into the SQL query without proper sanitization."
