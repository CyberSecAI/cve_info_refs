{
  "CVE-2007-0956": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The MIT krb5 telnet daemon fails to adequately check the provided username.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A malformed username beginning with \"-e\" can be interpreted as a command-line flag by the login.krb5 program. This causes login.krb5 to execute part of the BSD rlogin protocol, where an arbitrary username may be injected.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could log on to a vulnerable system via telnet with elevated privileges, potentially gaining unauthorized access to any account, including root. If telnetd is configured to only allow authenticated login, then only authenticated users can exploit this vulnerability.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote, via a crafted username supplied to the telnet daemon.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to send a crafted username to the telnet daemon. Authentication may be required depending on configuration."
