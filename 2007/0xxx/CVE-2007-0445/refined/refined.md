Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2007-0445:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Kaspersky Anti-Virus Engine's handling of ARJ archive files. Specifically, a heap-based buffer overflow occurs when processing malformed ARJ archives due to unchecked data copying from scanned archives into a heap buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when processing ARJ archives.
- Lack of proper validation or sanitization of data within ARJ archive being parsed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on systems running vulnerable versions of Kaspersky Anti-Virus Engine.
- The heap corruption due to the overflow can be leveraged to control program execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted ARJ archive files.
- Attackers can achieve exploitation by providing a specially crafted ARJ archive to an application that uses the vulnerable Kaspersky engine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need to be able to provide a crafted ARJ archive to a system running a vulnerable version of Kaspersky Anti-Virus engine (or an application using it).
- No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**
- Kaspersky has released an update to address this vulnerability
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected via Digital Vaccine protection filter ID '4930'.
