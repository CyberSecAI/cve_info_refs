## 11/30/2016 - Version 3.0.2

![](../data/bull.gif)stable version

### updates

* Compatibility fix for PHP 5.6
* Switched whole application to UTF-8 as default encoding
* when upgrading, please ensure to switch your data files / database tables to UTF-8 to take full advantage of Unicode support

## 03/18/2015 - Version 3.0.1

![](../data/bull.gif)stable version

### Updates

* Bugfix database setup: solved a problem with auto-sync to database on deployment
* Bugfix user administration: searching for user-names now takes into account databases with non-case-insensitive collation settings
* Updated language files: duplicate translation for "Logout" removed.
* Set configuration for updates to "stable"-channel
* Fixed some deprecated-warnings. Files should still be backwards compatible.
* Removed deprecated calltime pass-by-reference as this would break compatibility with PHP 5.4 and up.
* Updated translation classes to fix a compatibility issue with the latest version of the PCRE-library
* Updated form-generator classe to allow foreign keys use scalar types instead of automatically resolving them to dropdowns
* Database structure files now allow columns of type "TIME" to extend element "DISPLAY" with a boolean element "WITH\_TIME". If DISPLAY.WITH\_TIME is "true" then editing the data-set will also provide a time-picker instead of just a date-picker. Defaults to "false".
* Bugfix for DbStream-class: Fixed a false-positive where function query() would detect a semicolon in a string as a potential sql-injection attempt. I guess we were a little too paranoid here.
* Updated DbCreator-class: For auto-deployments to MySQL it now uses the current MySQL-syntax "ENGINE=[name]" to select the database engine, instead of "TYPE=[name]" which was deprecated.

## 06/08/2011 - Version 4.0.0 Beta 2

![](../data/bull.gif)for testing only

### Updates

* Plugin Calender: does not yet work with latest version of JQuery

## 01/04/2008 - version 3.0

![](../data/bull.gif)stable version

### Updates

* database setup: synchronization of databases is now optional (in expert mode)
* SDK: database tools have been exported to their own plugin (db\_tools). This allows a cleaner user interface.
* changes on templates:
  + Template 'entry.html' (guestbook): now shows the word "comment" and a graphic before comments.
* changes in language files:
  + English language only:
    - LANGUAGE.2 (guestbook.config) spelling
    - LANGUAGE.4 (guestbook.config) phrasing

## 12/24/2008 - version 3.0.0RC2

![](../data/bull.gif)update only necessary if you encountered problems with the previous version

### Updates

* manual, texts, figures and tutorials have been updated
* Code-templates for ConTEXT and PSPad have been updated

* changes in language files:
  + new: LANGUAGE.TITLE\_LANG (default.config)

### Bugfix / Maintenance

* Template function [%embeddedTags%] didn't have the value "smilies" in the list of standard tags. Note to developers: with this fix controls for embedding icons will be added to existing forms as well, if these are set to use the standard tag list. If this is not desirable, you may define an exclusion list by using the parameter "hide".

## 11/17/2008 - version 3.0.0RC1

![](../data/bull.gif)update only necessary if you encountered problems with the previous version

### new Features

* eased development of AJAX applications
* new guestbook plug-in (uses new AJAX functions)
* prefered language of user is detected automatically

* Compatibility: File-Locking, CHMOD with UMask
  + Improved compatibility for Linux systems without support for file-locking. This may have caused problems with running the program.
  + Improved compatibility with Unix- and Linux systems, which use a UMask. This is a system specific setting, which has influence on user privileges.
* DB Query Builder API
  + Resolved a problem with using ORDER BY on joined tables, when using ambiguous column names.

## 03/26/2008 - version 2.9.9

![](../data/bull.gif)Update recommended

### Updates

## version 2.9.7

![](../data/bull.gif)closed (non-public) test version

## 08/16/2007 - version 2.9.6

![](../data/bull.gif)test version

### new Features

* SDK: new option to export the structure of a database to a SQL file
* templates: auto-generated vertical and (new) horizontal tree menus
* in forms the syntax of emb.Tags in your text is checked automatically on submit
* DB-API: improved automatic resolution of inheritance on the tables of a database.
  + If one table inherits from another, all queries on the child will be treated as queries on a virtual, updateable view and include all ancestors of the queried table. The path of inheritance is auto-detected.
  + It is no longer necessary to query all tables via a complex join statement and "wrap" the pieces together. Instead a function call like $db->get('foo') is enough to get the whole table including all inherited properties.
  + Support was added for MySQL's "unsigned" and "zerofill" properties. Where not supported by the DBMS they are emulated by the framework.
  + Support for the special datatype "set" was added. This feature may be emulated for any DBMS.
* DB-Backup: it is now possible to export and download databases including the data-structure as SQL via the administrator's menu.

### Updates

* New system cache introduced. This reduces the start-up time for all core components by up to 90%. This may ammount to 0.3 s per request (of course depending on the system you use).
* Additional optimization improves over-all-performance by another 10%.
* SDK: improved reverse engineering capabilities for MySQL databases. This will now respect database prefixes and detect default values, foreign keys, profile constraints, comments and indexes.
* new JavaScript functions:
  + yanaSmlDecode() enables AJAX applications to work with the much simpler SML-Strings as an alternative to XML.
  + yanaAddEventListener() enables the developer to bind multiple event handling routines to a group of tags in a more comfortable way.
  + yanaCheckEmbTags() checks values in textearea elements for faulty emb. tags and returns a detailed error description.
  + yanaGetElementsByClassName() returns a list of all HTML nodes, whose class attribute match a certain value.
* new functions:
  + String::htmlSpecialChars() implements the new arguments, which have been added in PHP 5.2.3, for use with PHP4 and previous versions of PHP5.
  + DbQuery::getParent() where on table inherits from another, this function returns the parent for a given child.
  + DbQuery::getParentByColumn() where a table inherits properties from a number of ancestors, this functions returns the name of the table, where an inherited property was specified.
  + DbQuery::setColumns() sets the names of multiple columns to retrieve in a single call for a "select" statement.
  + DbQuery::getColumns() returns a list of all currently chosen columns.
  + DbStream::getTableInfo() returns detailed information on the structure of a table.
  + New class DbExtractor enables users to create backups of databases easily.
  + class "StructureFile" renamed to "DbStructure" to better comply with the naming convention of the framework (old class is still there for compatibility reasons, but it is "deprecated")
* changes in language files:
  + Translations for plugin "sdk" have been updated.
  + new:

  + ul.hmenu li.entry a
  + ul.hmenu li.hmenu
  + ul.hmenu li.hmenu div.menu\_head
  + ul.hmenu li.hmenu ul.hmenu
  + ul.hmenu li.menu\_hover
* DbStructure:
  + databases may not have the new element "description".
* manual updated

### Bugfix / Maintenance

* Missing english translations added for the following texts: LANGUAGE.BUTTON\_SAVEASNEW, TEXT.SUCCESS

### Notes

* The newly introduced system cache may be deactivated using the constant YANA\_CACHE\_ACTIVE where this is necessary.
* On virtual drives the allowed values for property "AUTOMOUNT" change from "yes", "no" to "true" and "false". Updated files for all virtual drives are included in this package. However, if you have defined custom drives, you might need to update their configuration.
* Template designers may use the following function call to create the new horizontal tree menus `[%printUnorderedList value=$foo keys_as_href=true layout=3%]`

## 07/18/2007 - version 2.9.5

![](../data/bull.gif)test version

### new Features

* EmbTags: it is now possible to define your own EmbTags for each profile
* Extensions: to write your own plugins, there are two now extensions available for ConTEXT and PSPad, including keyboard shortcuts for all Yana functions and also PHPDoc comments. The extensions are included in the manual.
* Forms:
  + all auto-generated forms now have a filter function
  + Edit-forms now have an option, to save the currently edited entry under another name as a new data set.
* API documentation now includes descriptions for the JavaScript functions and classes provided by the framework.

### Updates

* JS tree menu: open and closed menus are saved during a session, so menu keep their state on reload
* Database: it is now possible to extend the property "action", which creates a link on the data set, by the sub-properties "title" and "text", which let you define a text and tooltip on the link.
* updated extensions for ConTEXT and PSPad
* class "InputStream" renamed to "FileSystemResource"
* class "SecureInputStream" renamed to "FileReadonly" (old class is still there for compatibility reasons, but it is "deprecated")

* new function DbStream->commit() (Alias: DbStream->write())
* new function FormCreator->hasFilter()
* new function FormCreator->allowNewEntry()
* AJAX: simultane calls and handling of concurrent request with pairwise different functions for event handling operations are now possible. A new dispatching method coordinates the distribution of the response object to all requesting functions automatically. This new feature applies automatically to all code. It is not necessary to change the code yourself.
* Templates: documents in HTML 4.1 have been replaced by XHTML 1.0 documents
* improved support for IE 7
* Template designers may now layout each column of a table, created by the form generator, individually using CSS. For this purpose the program offers the following new CSS-classes:
  + .gui\_generator\_even\_row
  + .gui\_generator\_odd\_row
  + .gui\_generator\_new\_row
  + .gui\_generator\_{table}\_{column} (table= table name, column=column name)
* new JavaScript functions:
  + yanaSetCookie()
  + yanaGetCookie()
  + yanaXmlDecode()
* changes in language files:
  + new message: 'field\_missing' with argument 'field'
  + new message: 'field\_invalid' with argument 'field'
  + new:
    - LANGUAGE.BUTTON\_SAVEASNEW
    - LANGUAGE.WHERE
    - LANGUAGE.MENU
  + updated translation for plugin "search"
  + SDK: labels in the auto-generated side menu now provide an English and German translation: LANGUAGE.MENU.\*

### Bugfix / Maintenance

* template function preview(): interpretation of argument $width fixed
* function Dir->copy() now does also work with absolute path names in a Win32 environment
* CDROM version (only applies to Win32 systems), path names in virtual drives of plugins are now resolved correctly, even when using absolute path names on a windows system

### Notes

* function DbStream->insert() changed. This function now only handles insert statements and does not automatically update a dataset anymore, in case it already exists. The original behavior of the function is now implemented within the function DbStream->insertOrUpdate(). However, there is a compatibility mode for older scripts, that will simulate the previous behavior of versions 2.9.4 and older. To activate it, open the file "library.php" and set YANA\_DB\_COMPAT\_INSERT to true.

## 06/12/2007 - version 2.9.4

![](../data/bull.gif)test version

### new Features

* default skin has been renewed, improved look & feel
* forms, that are available in different layouts, now provide a list with previews

### Updates

* improved the structure of the self-diagnosis file, by introducing XML and semantic tagging to provide an easier access for third-party applications
* columns of type 'url' are now presented as clickable links - clicking the link informs the user that he is leaving the current site and asks him to confirm the action (juristic reasons + avoid accidental clicks)
* HTML-code configuration panel menues (setup) has been cleaned up
* class "GuiCreator" has been renamed to "FormCreator", class "GuiCreator" is deprecated and remains in this package only for backwards-compatibility
* the constants GUI\_\*foo\* have been renamed to FORM\_\*foo\* to comply with the new class name, the old constants remain for backwards-compatibility, but they are deprecated
* new function FormCreator->createForm() - you can now create database forms with an OO-style API from within your PHP-Code and export them as HTML
* template function "create" now supports the argument "layout", that lets you (and your visitors) choose between various presentation of a form where available - thus the templates "view\_seperated" and "view\_details" became deprecated. Instead they can be found as layout values "1" and "2" of template "view" (layout "0" is the same as template "view"). In addition the new layout value "3" refers to a new list-style view, which presents summaries of all rows as a clickable list. Clicking the list items opens details.
* warnings for failed assertions now also have a backtrace (applies to debugging only)
* Database structure files now support the column-property 'action'. This property tells the form generator to produce a clickable link on the column. This feature can be used to ease browsing tables. E.g. clicking a foreign key opens the associated dataset(s) in another table.
* The SDK now autoappends the property 'action' on foreign keys.
* Database structure files now support the column-type 'reference'. References do not show up in forms created by the form generator, but can be combined with the new 'action' property. This allows developers to present n:m associations between tables as clickable links.
* The user administration panel now provides you with a renewed interface.
* Provided implementation of the PHP5 function "http\_build\_query()" to PHP4.
* The SDK now automatically adds sitemap icons to new plugins.
* new function DbQuery::resetQuery()
* some language strings have been renamed to better comply with naming conventions:
  + TEXT.UNGENUEGENDE\_RECHTE = TEXT.INSUFFICIENT\_RIGHTS
  + TEXT.FEHLER = TEXT.INPUT\_MISSING
  + TEXT.UNGUELTIGE\_EINGABE = TEXT.INPUT\_INVALID (old version remains for compatibility reasons, but is deprecated)

This means, you may restrict the visibility of columns to certain groups of users.

### Notes

* JavaScript function "preview()" is deprecated and should no longer be called directly. In case you designed skins, which use this function, please replace it with the new template function [%preview%]
* the following JavaScript function have been renamed to avoid naming conflicts:

* because the token $INSERT\_CONTENT\_HERE has been replaced (see above), skins from versions previous to 2.9.2 do become incompatible. To update a skin to a newer version, please replace in all templates all entities of the string [%$INSERT\_CONTENT\_HERE%] with [%import id=$SYSTEM\_INSERT%].

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
