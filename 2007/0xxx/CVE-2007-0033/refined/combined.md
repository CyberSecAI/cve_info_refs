### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update addresses several newly discovered, privately and publicly reported vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are documented in the âVulnerability Detailsâ section of this bulletin.

When using vulnerable versions of Office, if a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

#### FAQ for Microsoft Outlook VEVENT Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0033:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Outlook. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when Outlook parses a file and processes a malformed VEVENT record.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Outlook does not perform sufficient data validation when processing the contents of an .iCal meeting request. When Outlook opens a specially crafted .iCal meeting request and parses a malformed VEVENT request, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What is an .iCal meeting request?**

An iCal is used to create a meeting request to a recipient over the Internet, or outside the organization.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted .ICS (iCal) file or embed the contents of an iCal calendar request in the body of a specially crafted e-mail and send it to a user of Outlook who connects to a POP, IMAP or HTTP server to retrieve their e-mail.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet.

#### Microsoft Outlook Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1305

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in Outlook in its processing of e-mail header information. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could send a malformed e-mail to a user of Outlook that would cause the Outlook client to fail under certain circumstances. The Outlook client would continue to fail so long as the malformed e-mail message remained on the e-mail server. The e-mail message could be deleted by an e-mail administrator, or by the user via another e-mail client such as Outlook Web Access or Outlook Express, after which point the Outlook client would again function normally.

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Outlook Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1305:

* The vulnerability is a denial of service vulnerability only. The attacker would not be able to access the user's e-mail or system in any way. The vulnerability could not be used to read, delete, create, or alter the user's e-mail.
* If an attacker was able to send a malformed e-mail that successfully exploited this vulnerability, the malformed e-mail could be deleted either by an e-mail administrator, or by the user via another e-mail client such as Outlook Web Access or Outlook Express. Once the specially malformed e-mail has been removed, normal operation would resume.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft Outlook Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1305:

We have not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for Microsoft Outlook Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1305:

#### Microsoft Outlook Advanced Find Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0034

A [remote code execution](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in Microsoft Outlook. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when Outlook parses an .oss file.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Outlook Advanced Find Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0034:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office Saved Searches (.oss) file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft Outlook Advanced Find Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0034:

* Do not open or save Office Saved Searches (.oss) files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for commonly misconfigured security parameters. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

* **File Version Verification**

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system, language, or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

## Microsoft Outlook fails to properly process a VEVENT record

#### Vulnerability Note VU#476900

Original Release Date: 2007-01-09 | Last Revised: 2007-01-26

---

### Overview

Microsoft Outlook contains a memory corruption vulnerability that could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code and gain complete control of the vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft Outlook fails to properly handle malformed VEVENT records. When an .iCal meeting request containing a VEVENT record is opened, Outlook does not properly perform data validation on the record. An attacker could send a specially crafted .ics file in the request that, when opened, could corrupt system memory allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code. The attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker could gain complete control of the affected system and execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Microsoft addresses this vulnerability with the updates listed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-003](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS07-003.mspx). Note that Microsoft has documented known issues that occur after applying this update. See Microsoft Knowledgebase article [925938](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/925938) for details. |
| --- |

| Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
