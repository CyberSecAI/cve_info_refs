{
  "CVE-2007-0033": {
    "Root cause": "Insufficient data validation when processing .iCal meeting requests, specifically a malformed VEVENT record.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to lack of validation of the VEVENT record within an iCalendar file (.ics).",
      "Improper handling of message lengths when parsing iCal meeting requests"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker can gain complete control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new user accounts with full user rights. Impact is reduced for users with limited user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted .ICS (iCal) file to a user.",
      "Embedding the crafted iCal content in the body of an email."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to send specially crafted emails or provide malicious .ics files to a target user. User interaction is required to open the malicious file or email."
  }
