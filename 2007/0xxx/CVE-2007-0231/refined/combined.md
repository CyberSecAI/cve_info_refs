**Note:**These pages make extensive use of the latest XHTML and CSS [Standards](http://www.w3.org). They ought to look great in any standards-compliant modern browser. Unfortunately, they will probably look horrible in older browsers, like Netscape 4.x and IE 4.x. Moreover, many posts use MathML, which is, currently *only* supported in Mozilla. My best suggestion (and you will *thank* me when surfing an ever-increasing number of sites on the web which have been crafted to use the new standards) is to upgrade to the latest version of your browser. If that's not possible, consider moving to the Standards-compliant and open-source [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org) browser.

## January 5, 2007

### Full Disclosure

A little over a month ago, [Mike Stay](http://math.ucr.edu/~mike) noticed [something really bad](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2006/09/texnical_issues.html#c006450). Our [MovableType](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/) installation seemed to be vulnerable to script injection. In fact, it did not seem to be doing *any* sanitization on user input at all! You could type any ([valid](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000383.html)) XHTML input a comment, and it would be accepted.

This was very puzzling, as comments *used to be* sanitized. I contacted [Zack Ajmal](http://www.zackvision.com/), who has an MT installation similar to mine, which also seemed to be vulnerable. Searching around the ‘Net, some MT 3.3 blogs seemed to be vulnerable; others did not. Eventually, it transpired that those who had disabled the [“nofollow” plugin](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/docs/3.3/k_preinstalled_plugins/nofollow/) , had inadvertently disabled comment-sanitization as well[1](#DisclosureF1). [SixApart](http://www.sixapart.com/), in their wisdom, had bypassed the sanitization code in the body of the application (where it used to take place) and did the sanitization in the plugin instead. Which meant that if you disabled the plugin …

This was **bad**, and Zack contacted SixApart on December 6. They asked him to hold off on disclosing the vulnerability for 30 days. That interval has passed, and Zack has [published details](http://www.zackvision.com/weblog/2007/01/movabletype-security-bug.html) of the vulnerability on his blog. I’m doing so, too, in the interest of getting the word out to those who may be vulnerable.

Until SixApart issues an update, you have two options for fixing the problem

1. Re-enable the “nofollow” plugin.
2. Add an explicit `sanitize="1"` attribute to any MovableType tag that needs sanitizing:
   > ```
   > <MTCommentBody sanitize="1">
   > <MTCommentPreviewBody  sanitize="1">
   > <MTCommentAuthorLink  sanitize="1">
   > ...
   > ```

I’ve taken the latter course. But, whatever you do, make *sure* you’re not allowing commenters to insert arbitrary javascript code onto your blog!

#### Update:

[MT 3.34](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/news/2007/01/mt334_released.html) fixes [this issue](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/beta/distros/MT-3.34-beta-Release-Notes.html) (along with some others). ⊡

---

1 In my case, “nofollow” is disabled for the [comment body](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000498.html), and for the [author-link](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000505.html) of [PGP-signed comments](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000320.html). The [OpenPGPComment plugin](http://www.srijith.net/codes/openpgpcomment/) has its own template tags (`<MTPGPCommentBody>`, *etc.*) which are not operated-on by the “nofollow” plugin.

### Re: Full Disclosure

Wow, that sounds pretty bad. I wonder why they haven’t made a public notification, or moved in to fix it. Especially after you have publicised it thus - it must be easy for someone to track down blogs powered by the version of MT you mention.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
