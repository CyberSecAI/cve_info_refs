Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0881:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `oi_dir` variable in the `index.php` file of the "site protection" plugin for Openi CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The unsanitized `oi_dir` variable allows an attacker to include a remote file by manipulating the `config[oi_dir]` parameter. This can be exploited using a URL to a malicious PHP script hosted on an attacker's server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core issue is that the `oi_dir` variable, intended to specify a directory, is not checked or sanitized before being used in the `require_once()` function, making it possible to include arbitrary files from external sources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP script, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This allows the attacker to potentially gain control of the server, steal data, modify website content, or launch further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by sending an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` file, with a crafted `config[oi_dir]` parameter containing the URL of the malicious PHP file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugin/Path:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable plugin (`/open-admin/plugins/site_protection/index.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`config[oi_dir]`).
- **Malicious PHP Script:** The attacker needs to host a malicious PHP script on their server and make it accessible via a URL.

**Additional Notes**
- The exploit notes that `oi_dir` might need to be changed to `openi_dir` depending on the CMS config but that the underlying vulnerability remains.
- The provided content gives a specific Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit.
