```
Root cause of vulnerability: The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the 'id' parameter of the 'user.php' script. Specifically, the application directly concatenates the user-provided 'id' value into a SQL query without using proper quoting or escaping mechanisms.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to:
    - Disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., database user credentials, application data).
    - Modification or deletion of data.
    - Potential for further system compromise depending on database privileges.

Attack vectors: The vulnerability is located in the 'user.php' script, specifically in how it handles the 'id' parameter within the URL.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs the ability to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and to manipulate the 'id' parameter in the URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1/ig-calendar/user.php?id=999`).
