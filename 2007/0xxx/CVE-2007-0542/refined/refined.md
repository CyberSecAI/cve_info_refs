Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0542:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the `show.php` file of the Guestbook application, specifically within the `user` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the `user` parameter of the `show.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code, which will be executed by the victim's browser when viewing the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Cookie Theft:** The example exploit demonstrates the ability to steal user cookies via injected JavaScript. This could lead to session hijacking and unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Page Manipulation:** An attacker could modify the content of the page, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions within the user's browser.
*   **Partial Confidentiality Impact:** Sensitive user information such as cookies can be stolen.
*    **Partial Integrity Impact**: The content of the page can be modified by the attacker.
*   **Partial Availability Impact:** The injected scripts may disrupt the normal behavior of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via HTTP requests.
*   **URL Parameter Injection:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious code directly into the `user` parameter of the `show.php` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Guestbook version 4.00 beta.
*   The provided example exploit showcases an alert popup containing the user's cookies using the injected script: `'><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>`.
*   The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
*   CVSS score is given as 6.8, with exploitability subscore of 8.6 and impact subscore of 6.4
