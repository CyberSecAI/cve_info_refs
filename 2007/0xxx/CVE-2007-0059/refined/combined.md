# Backdooring QuickTime Movies

Tue, 05 Sep 2006 22:51:33 GMTby
[pdp](/members/pdp.html)

XSS attacks are nothing new, but an evil mind can find ways to use them to bypass border firewalls and highly expensive intrusion prevention systems in order to attack your organization from inside. This post outlines an [example](https://chatbotkit.com/examples) of how to use QuickTime Movie files to trick the user into executing malicious JavaScript code. The technique presented here does not rely on a vulnerability bur rather on an insecure feature present in QuickTime player from version 3 up to the latest version 7.

This technique makes use of one of the very well know features in QuickTime called Text Tracks. Movie files are usually constructed of video and audio tracks. They provide the auditory and visual characteristics of the movie. On the top of them Text Tracks are responsible for subtitles, lyrics and other very interesting and highly productive accessibility features.

One layer bellow, Text Tracks can be of different types. There are many of them but the ones that are the most interesting are called `HREF Tracks`. `HREF` Tracks contain links that will be opened automatically or when the user clicks on the movie frame. These links can point to URLs from the `FTP/HTTP/HTTPS` space and also other supported protocols such as the JavaScript protocol (javascript:). Effectively, this feature can be used by attackers to hide malicious code inside a `.mov` file which will be executed automatically on preview.

HREF Tracks can be created with QuickTime Pro and probably other .mov editors and publishers. I wasn't able to find any command line tools although while researching, several good opensource QuickTime editing libraries were encountered. The following post examines the process of creating a backdoored .mov file with QuickTime Pro.

The first stage is to create a Text Track. Text Tracks are simple .txt files that contain special syntax. For the purpose of this proof of concept I composed the following track named (backdoor.txt).

```
A<javascript:alert("hello from backdoor")> T<>
```

Obviously the code above will display an alert box. The prefix A defines that the action will be automatic - no user interaction is required. There is also T flag, which specifies the target for the action. In this case it is kept null.

The next stage is to open both `backdoor.txt` and the movie that will be backdoored with QuickTime Pro. I chose [Sample.mov](/files/2006/09/sample.mov). This is standard movie file that is supplied with every default QuickTime installation.

Once opened, select the tack file and click on Edit -> Select All. This will select the entire track. Than you need to copy it by going to Edit -> Copy.

> ![Backdoor TXT MOV](/files/2006/09/backdoortxtmov.jpg "Backdoor TXT MOV")

The next stage is obviously pasting. Select Sample.mov and click on Edit -> Select All and than Edit -> Add to Selection and Scale. After performing this action you will see that part of Sample.mov frame is covered in black with text inside. This is the Text Track.

> ![Sample TXT MOV](/files/2006/09/sampletxtmov.jpg "Sample TXT MOV")

Once the Text Track is there, it has to be converted to HREF Track. Select Sample.mov window and click on Window -> Show Movie Properties. In the Movie Properties dialog select "Text Track" and untick the check box next to the label. The last stage is to change the name of "Text Track" to "HREFTrack". Figure this out yourself :).

> ![Hreftrack](/files/2006/09/hreftrack.jpg "Hreftrack")

When all this is done, Save as [Sample.mov](/files/2006/09/sample.mov) to [Sample-backdoored.mov](/files/2006/09/sample-backdoored.mov) or whatever you feel comfortable with.

*The produced file will popup an alert box when opened in the browser window. There is no need to discuss again why this is dangerous and in what ways it can be used to bring havoc and destruction. The important bit is to never trust anything from the web. Movie trailers should not be previewed unless they come from apple.com. Don't open audio files or anything that ends with .mov. This is my advice for now :).*

![pagvac](//gravatar.com/avatar/c34e06c4b96ab0fbcf661527205ec988?s=256&d=retro)pagvacGood job pdp! I like the concept of XSS through the backdooring of media files. Everyone likes media files, so it's an ideal way to exploit both human and technical weaknesses.
Imagine downloading Michael's Jackson Thriller video clip which exploits your router's web interface in order to expose internal hosts to the Internet :D
Nice one!
![Alberto](//gravatar.com/avatar/496d41d99736af7cc2104508c00ee715?s=256&d=retro)AlbertoI'm probably posting a real newbie question, but I've opened both files you provided with QuickTime Alternative codecs (with VLC and Media Player Classic) and I can't see any difference or pop-up. It is just silently failing but still vulnerable or this codec (Quicktime 7.0.4) is safer to use?![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpThe example backdoor will work only if the movie file is embedded inside a page or previewed inside the browser.
However, it is possible to make a movie that is previewed inside a standalone QuickTime player to open a remote page which in tern can contain malicious code. Of course this is not very stealthy but can be successfully used to attack the browser at a very low level.
I havenâ€™t tested opening URLs with VLC and Media Player Classic. However, if both players support HREFTracks, than they are affected by this issue.![nrg](//gravatar.com/avatar/3e0298a2854e87166f6ddcee1fe4e005?s=256&d=retro)nrg@Alberto You have to open in a program that can interpret javascript. Like a web browser. just click in the video link to see it in your browser.

Although nice find, great work.![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpI wish I have more time to play with that. But, yeh... well said.![Chris](//gravatar.com/avatar/72b4146dbe097766f0927a20dae4a2dc?s=256&d=retro)ChrisIsn't this already widely used on Gnutella? There is a lot of .mov spam, usually pr0n but also for other sites, which will open certain links in a browser window. I don't think these use JavaScript though.![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpChris,
you might be right. I am not sure. Several readers verified that some video formats are able to open links in the browser. It will be good if someone verifies all that.![smetten](//gravatar.com/avatar/4fae41220c16f84caeeb402fb242f432?s=256&d=retro)smettenHi all,
This seems to be very interesting information. I'll be having a good look at this, might come in handy some time.

Smetten![...](//gravatar.com/avatar/19432a7e08878a8eac210f9c827dcb2b?s=256&d=retro)...jesus, you made me spend like 10 minutes looking for a way to rename the text track to HREFtrack :)
anyone else who wants to do this, just single click on the text track name and you can edit it![Loucas](//gravatar.com/avatar/53261b12b1efb53d6906c238344a69e7?s=256&d=retro)LoucasHi thanks for the example. I would like to know if is possible to create the popup alter when the movie is previewed inside a standalone QuickTime player.![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpIMHO I don't think it is possible. What ever you do, it will be opened in a browser window. However, don't take my word for granted.
Have you seen any .mov files that open pop-up boxes rather than full browser windows? If yes, it will be easy to decompose that and see what is going on.![mistersquid](//gravatar.com/avatar/6d02dabfa3913cd68dc8acd4594e4859?s=256&d=retro)mistersquidI've loaded the Sample\_backdoored.mov in my web browser (Safari 2.0.4) with OS X 10.4.8 (Security Update 2006-07) and I'm not getting any pop-ups.
I'm running QuickTime 7.1.3 but not QuickTime Pro.
This proof-of-concept seems to be a non-starter.![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpHello mistersqui, unfortunately I am not running MacOS. However, here from my side it works. If somebody is willing to investigate on that matter, please you are more than welcome.
I don't think that Apple has fixed this issue and I am not sure if they will because the exploit presented in this article depends on a feature rather than a bug. Many thanks.![ohemia](//gravatar.com/avatar/7049b1d7ce3809a9705271cfb0727890?s=256&d=retro)ohemiaI agree with mistersquid - no popup here on MacOS X. Doesn't seem to work at all on the Mac.![Jeffbart](//gravatar.com/avatar/8b099ac895b300eaac27157e5962e76f?s=256&d=retro)JeffbartNot getting popup either. Also running Safari 2.0.4. Not installed latest security updates. 0S X 10.4.8.![Anton](//gravatar.com/avatar/0c69a88addcf1c84c39a619eca83ca32?s=256&d=retro)AntonThe demonstration works in FireFox 2.0 on Mac OS X 10.4.8. It does not work with Safari.
I'm not sure why. Apple's QT documentation claims only that JavaScript functions defined on the same web page as the movie can be invoked, so perhaps Safari is adhering more strictly to this specification.![BdcstTek](//gravatar.com/avatar/c5d9ffc8c870120901be4f20e228ddb5?s=256&d=retro)BdcstTekMac OSX, Version 10.4.6, without the latest security update...(probably without a few)
Safari v 2.0.3 is not affected: no popup window
Firefox v 1.5.08 IS affected, and Backdoor did indeed say hi.
Which goes along with the way Safari seems to "Think Different" with JS a bit too much.![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpI guess it is all clear now. Safari complies with Apple's specifications while Firefox and IE don't. There must be something wrong with QuickTime browser integration.![Wladimir Palant](//gravatar.com/avatar/7806629160a492b05d21fd738953a4cf?s=256&d=retro)Wladimir PalantWhat I fail to see here is the XSS part of it. It is bad of course that a movie can load web content through the browser (why did they chose to do this instead of connecting directly from the plugin???) but any JavaScript is still executed in the context of the web page. This means that it will only be able to do something the web page itself can do, so that anybody able to put a movie into a web page could do the same by directly putting the necessary JavaScript code into it. Unless of course it is used somewhere where JavaScript is filtered out but movies are allowed - is it what happened on MySpace?![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpexactly!![Brennan Young](//gravatar.com/avatar/61717cb9574d9ca13af8c10f155c6239?s=256&d=retro)Brennan YoungThis isn't a backdoor. It's a sloppily coded website. The same sh1t can happen with SWFs and DCRs.
HREF tracks have been around for about 10 years, with all this functionality. This page is worth a look, especially the last section "More on QuickTime and HREFs.":
http://www.apple.com/quicktime/tutorials/hreftracks.html
Scarcely news, but it's great if you guys see some more of what QuickTime can do, even if you all have dastardly plans. ;)
The page linked above also shows how a MOV can open any QuickTime viewable file in another window \*in QuickTime player itself\*, if you wanted to make a little grey-goo / denial of service beastie.
There's also a turing-complete bytecode interpreter built-in to QuickTime. Apple usually forgets to mention it because it doesn't help to sell iPods.
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/quicktime/RM/rmWiredIntro.htm
So, if you're feeling particularly dastardly your MOV could even construct javascript URLs on the fly.![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpHi Brennan,
yes you are completely right. However, It is the same situation with everything in the computer security field. Look at BF attacks, for example. We know about them since the 80s. Still, people find clever ways to inject instructions into remote and local processes.
I am sure that HREF tracks is nothing new to core QuickTime/Apple developers. However, the problem is that they wasn't able to spot this potential misuse of their technology. It is not their fault. At the time when this technology was designed, I don't think that anyone was familiar with XSS to that extend as we are today. This problem is so common and I am sure we will see more of it very soon.![Richard John](//gravatar.com/avatar/2ced4279a627bd560f46883f7fd461ea?s=256&d=retro)Richard JohnHmm... When I try and rename Text Track to HREFTrack, I change the name and it changes back as soon as I hit enter!![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpRichard, that's not supposed to happen. You are sure that you do it properly. The GUI is a bit bulky.![ConcernedUser](//gravatar.com/avatar/ca64f83212ec0e936bded653e2387144?s=256&d=retro)ConcernedUserHi. I was wondering is there any way to check the existing mov files that I have if they have any href tracks in them. I do not have quicktime pro. Also, how can u detect that a mov file in your browser might have a malicious href track before playing it?![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpConcernedUser, I am not aware of any tools that you can use. It will be good if someone can come up with Firefox extension, but this probably wont happen. The best thing to so is to wait for a fix from Adobe. Actually there is one that is offered to MySpace users only on Windows platform. If you happen to be on Window, go to MySpace an try to open .mov file that someone has hosted. Then you will receive the update. There are other solutions but they are all unofficial and they might work only in certain situations. Good luck.
I hope Apple understands that this is a serious security issue and it requires immediate actions.![psyc](//gravatar.com/avatar/632819dac251da66e2131ada45ea5adc?s=256&d=retro)psycHmm... When I try and rename Text Track to HREFTrack, I change the name and it changes back as soon as I hit enter!

So, to the extent that people can be made to be extra reluctant to even open a .mov file, that helps keep the evidence (and danger to the actual perpetrators) as well-suppressed as it's been.
BTW, that site (like this one) uses JS, harmlessly, but its QT videos do not contain any embedded code or scripts of any kind.

## Apple Quicktime HREFTrack Cross-Zone Scripting vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#304064

Original Release Date: 2007-01-12 | Last Revised: 2007-03-19

---

### Overview

Web browsers running the Apple QuickTime plugin may allow remote web sites to reference content on the local filesystem. This may allow an attacker to execute script within the security context of the local machine.

### Description

| Web browser plugins that allow remote web sites to reference content that resides on the local filesystem may be vulnerable to cross-domain security violations. In a typical attack scenario, an attacker must first place content in a known or predictable location on a computer. If a web browser plugin allows a remote web site to reference that content, this may allow attacker-supplied script to run within the security context of the local machine.  The Apple QuickTime plugin running in Microsoft Internet Explorer or Apple Safari fails to restrict web sites from accessing content on the local filesystem. Current proof-of-concept exploit code uses the HREFTrack attribute to exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability in a file on Windows systems. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute script within the security context of the local machine. Script that executes within this context may be able to perform privileged actions, such as reading files from the local filesystem. These actions would not be possible by using script that executes within the security context of the remote web site. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**This issue is addressed in Apple QuickTime 7.1.5 security document [305149](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305149). An update for Microsoft Windows is available on [Apple Downloads](http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/) and via Software Update. |
| --- |

| **Disable the QuickTime ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer**The vulnerable QuickTime ActiveX controls can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSIDs:{02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B}{4063BE15-3B08-470D-A0D5-B37161CFFD69}More information about how to set the kill bit is available in [Microsoft Support Document 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for these controls:Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{4063BE15-3B08-470D-A0D5-B37161CFFD69}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400**Disable file association for QuickTime files**Disable the file association for QuickTime file types to help prevent windows applications from using Apple QuickTime to open QuickTime files. This can be accomplished by deleting the following registry keys:HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\QuickTime.\*This will remove the association for approximately 32 file types that are configured to open with the QuickTime Player software. **Disable JavaScript**For instructions on how to disable JavaScript, please refer to the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/) document. This can help prevent some attack techniques that use the QuickTime plug-in or ActiveX control.**Do not access QuickTime files from untrusted sources**Attackers may host malicious QuickTime files on web sites. To convince users to visit their sites, those attackers often use a variety of techniques to create misleading links, including URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, and intentional misspellings. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. |
