{
  "Root cause": "The application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to the insecure use of the $Root_To_Script variable in include statements.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Remote File Inclusion vulnerability"
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'Root_To_Script' parameter in the URL, an attacker can specify a remote file to be included by the vulnerable PHP script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious PHP file on a publicly accessible server and to be able to send HTTP requests with the modified URL to the vulnerable application."
