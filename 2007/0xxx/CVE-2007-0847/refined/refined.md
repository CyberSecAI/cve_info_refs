Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2007-0847:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `reply.php` script in OTSCMS 2.1.5 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input being directly incorporated into a database query. The `profile` function of the `User` module in `forum.php` is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) by directly incorporating user-supplied data.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**  The `id` parameter in `reply.php` is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries. Specifically, the `extract` function is used to extract the `id` parameter, and then the `$id` variable is directly concatenated into the SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `name` parameter in `forum.php` is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary client-side script (JavaScript).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete database records, bypass authentication, or gain complete control of the database server and potentially the web server. In the provided example, an attacker could use the vulnerability to extract usernames and passwords from the accounts table.
    *  **XSS:** An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, phishing, redirection to malicious websites, or theft of sensitive information like cookies.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `priv.php` with the `command` parameter set to `reply` and a malicious `id` parameter.
    *   **XSS:** By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `forum.php` with the `module` parameter set to `User`, the `command` parameter set to `profile`, and a malicious `name` parameter.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web server. No special privileges on the server are required beyond this access.

**Technical Details:**

*   **SQL Injection Vulnerable Code:**
    ```php
    extract( $http->extract('id') );
    $pm = $db->query('SELECT [pms].`name` AS `name` [...]  ' AND [pms].`id` = ' . $id)->fetchAll();
    $pm = $pm[0];
    ```
    The vulnerable line is `AND [pms].`id` = ' . $id`. The attacker controls the `$id` variable, and this is directly inserted into the SQL query.

*   **XSS Vulnerable Code:**
    The XSS vulnerability is present in the `forum.php` script, specifically when rendering user profile information. The provided exploit shows that arbitrary HTML (JavaScript) can be injected into the `name` parameter and is executed when the profile is viewed.
*   **Example SQL Injection Attack:**
    `http://[target]/[path]/priv.php?command=reply&id=-1%20UNION%20SELECT%20accno,null,password%20FROM%20accounts`
*   **Example XSS Attack:**
    `http://[target]/[path]/forum.php?module=User&command=profile&name=<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>`
