| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=227952#c0)  Kris Van Hees    2007-02-09 01:20:09 UTC  ``` Description of problem:    Testsuite case in frysk exercises the kernel with tracing a small executable   (using strace), where the executable exec's a given command in a separate   thread.  When that non-main thread completed, a kernel bug is triggered.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):    kernel 2.6.19-1.2895.fc6  How reproducible:    About 3 out of 5 attempts.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Compile threadexec.c (attached) 2. Issue the command: strace -f -o /dev/null ./threadexec /bin/echo hi | grep hi 3. Repeat a few times if necessary    Actual results:    Program execution will print 'hi' on a single line.   Kernel BUG will be reported in kernel messages.  Expected results:    Program execution should print 'hi' on a single line.  Additional info:    The bugzilla report for frysk is:      <http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3820>    A similar earlier problem existed that prompted this test case to be written.   The original frysk bug was:      <http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2130>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=227952#c1)  Kris Van Hees    2007-02-09 01:20:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 147721](attachment.cgi?id=147721 "Executable that is to be strace'd") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=147721&action=edit "Executable that is to be strace'd") Executable that is to be strace'd   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=227952#c2)  Roland McGrath    2007-02-09 22:01:21 UTC  ``` This should already be fixed by pulling the current utrace patch (backported) into fc6.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=227952#c3)  Kris Van Hees    2007-03-07 20:36:53 UTC  ``` This is still happening with the 2.6.19-1.2911.6.5.fc6 kernel that was released a few days ago.  Caused the following kernel log entries, resulting in the machine getting stuck, requiring a power cycle.

It is a lot more reproducible on i386 than it is on x86_64, or so it seems on the tests systems, but both systems have experienced these hangs.  The hang is such that no kernel messages are written to kernel logs, making it a bit harder to capture what is going on and where exactly it is crashing.  Verbatim copy of the console state at time of the crash follows:  Stack:  ffff81000483b160 ffff810037e62500 ffff8100613820c0 000000000000000a  0000000000000001 ffffffff802ccadc 0000000000000009 ffff8100b707a2c0  ffff81000483f1a0 ffffffff80294fdb ffff81000483f2a0 0000000000000000 Call Trace:  <IRQ>  [<ffffffff802ccadc>] kmem_rcu_free+0x19/0x38  [<ffffffff80294fdb>] __rcu_process_callbacks+0x12d/0x1bc  [<ffffffff8029508d>] rcu_process_callbacks+0x23/0x43  [<ffffffff8028b742>] tasklet_action+0x53/0x9d  [<ffffffff8025a23c>] call_softirq+0x1c/0x28  [<ffffffff80211f97>] __do_softirq+0x55/0x2c  [<ffffffff8025a23c>] call_softirq+0x1c/0x28  <EOI>  [<ffffffff8028b630>] ksoftirqd+0x0/0xbf  [<ffffffff8026758d>] do_softirq+0x2c/0x85  [<ffffffff8028b68f>] ksoftirqd+0x5f/0xbf  [<ffffffff802317ea>] kthread+0xd0/0xff  [<ffffffff80259ec8>] child_rip+0xa/0x12  [<ffffffff8023171a>] kthread+0x0/0xff  [<ffffffff80259ebe>] child_rip+0x0/0x12   Code: 0f 0b eb fe 0f ba 33 07 48 83 c3 40 48 ff ca 48 83 fa ff 75 RIP  [<ffffffff802cab21>] kmem_freepages+0xef/0x132  RSP <ffff8100df623ee8>  <0>Kernel panic - not syncing: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=227952#c7)  Chuck Ebbert    2007-03-22 18:38:25 UTC  ``` 2.6.20-1.2933 has a new version of utrace. please test that.    ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=227952#c8)  Kris Van Hees    2007-05-30 17:28:24 UTC  ``` Running with 2.6.20-1.2948.fc6 we no longer see this failure take place.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=228816#c0)  Marcel Holtmann    2007-02-15 09:57:41 UTC  ``` It is possible to render a system with utrace support unusable in ~10 seconds (but not mainline kernel where Ctrl+C will kill process).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=228816#c7)  Roland McGrath    2007-03-07 11:20:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 149446](attachment.cgi?id=149446&action=diff "fix for utrace/ptrace leak and crash bugs with MT exec") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=149446&action=edit "fix for utrace/ptrace leak and crash bugs with MT exec") fix for utrace/ptrace leak and crash bugs with MT exec  This fixes both OOM and BUG_ON failure modes and another crash failure mode from the same problem.	I can't reproduce any problems in the test case after this patch, where I got all three failure modes before.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=228816#c11)  Roland McGrath    2007-03-07 19:40:38 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 149481](attachment.cgi?id=149481 "modified test program") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=149481&action=edit "modified test program") modified test program  Here is the version of the test I have been using. It prints out some more info, but not so much that it perturbed the behavior for me.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=228816#c12)  Roland McGrath    2007-03-08 02:14:02 UTC  ``` Fedora [bug 227952](show_bug.cgi?id=227952 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - Tracing execution of a threaded executable causes kernel BUG report") is the same problems as this.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=228816#c13)  Roland McGrath    2007-03-08 03:10:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 149546](attachment.cgi?id=149546&action=diff "fix for utrace/ptrace leak and crash bugs with MT exec + utrace_attach spin failure mode") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=149546&action=edit "fix for utrace/ptrace leak and crash bugs with MT exec + utrace_attach spin failure mode") fix for utrace/ptrace leak and crash bugs with MT exec + utrace_attach spin failure mode  This includes an additional fix that I think resolves a failure mode where utrace_attach spins when you try to kill the test with SIGKILL.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=228816#c23)  Don Howard    2007-03-29 21:41:51 UTC  ``` A patch for this issue has been included in zstream build 2.6.18-8.1.2.el5.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=228816#c26)  Mike Gahagan    2007-04-26 22:04:33 UTC  ``` fix verified on an x86_64 test system, I had to run 3 concurrent copies of ptrace_thrash to reproduce the problem initially.    ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=228816#c28)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-04-30 16:36:54 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below.
