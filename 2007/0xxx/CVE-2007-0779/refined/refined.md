  "CVE-2007-0779": {
    "description": "David Eckel reported that browser UI elements--such as the host name and security indicators--could be spoofed by using a large, mostly transparent, custom cursor and adjusting the CSS3 hotspot property so that the visible part of the cursor floated outside the browser content area.",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of CSS3 cursor hotspot property and custom cursors.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Spoofing of browser UI elements",
        "Lack of proper boundary checks for cursor rendering"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could trick users into believing they are visiting a different site by spoofing the address bar and other security indicators, potentially leading to phishing attacks or disclosure of sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious web page with crafted CSS and cursor properties"
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to host a malicious web page. Target user needs to visit the page in a vulnerable browser.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability is specific to Firefox 1.5 and later, and does not affect products based on Mozilla 1.7 or earlier such as Firefox 1.0.  This vulnerability exists because custom cursor images, combined with CSS hotspot properties, can be rendered outside the normal browser content area. By using a large, mostly transparent custom cursor and manipulating the hotspot, an attacker can overlay critical UI elements like the address bar, creating a spoofed appearance."
