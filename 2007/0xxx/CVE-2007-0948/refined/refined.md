  "CVE-2007-0948": {
    "Description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft Virtual PC and Microsoft Virtual Server that could allow a user with administrator permissions to the guest operating system to run code on the host operating system or other guest operating systems. An attacker with administrator permissions to the guest operating system, could exploit the vulnerability by running specially crafted code on the guest operating system. This could result in a heap overflow on the host or other guest operating systems. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by incorrect interaction and initialization of components that communicate with the host operating system in Microsoft Virtual PC and Microsoft Virtual Server.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with administrative privileges within a guest OS can execute arbitrary code on the host system or other guest VMs, leading to complete system control, potentially allowing the attacker to install programs, view, modify, or delete data.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a guest OS user with administrative rights running specially crafted code.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must have administrative privileges within the guest operating system to exploit this vulnerability."
