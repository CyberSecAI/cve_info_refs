- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Malformed disassociation packets sent to Intel 2200BG wireless cards can cause a kernel memory corruption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Kernel memory corruption due to a vulnerability in the Intel wireless mini-pci driver. The driver does not properly validate disassociation packets, leading to the vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can send a malformed disassociation packet, resulting in kernel memory corruption, ultimately causing a denial of service (BSOD).
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted 802.11 disassociation packet over the network to a vulnerable system using an Intel 2200BG wireless card.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within network range of the target machine to send the malicious disassociation packets. No authentication is needed.
