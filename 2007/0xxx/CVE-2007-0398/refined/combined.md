Forgive me for channelling Vinnie Barbarino from an old 70's US
show...

Researcher: sn0oPy
Ref: BUGTRAQ:20070119 a-forum xss
     <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/457503/100/0/threaded>

sn0oPy gives a google-dork URL that shows a number of French web sites
that apparently have the relevant program.  But the vendor site,
www.mistersp.com, doesn't say anything about "a-forum" and a
view-source of some of the google-dork'ed sites doesn't point to this,
either.

So, who developed what product?

- Steve
