  "CVE-2007-0995": {
    "description": "The Mozilla parser formerly ignored invalid trailing characters in HTML tag attribute names. This could in some cases be abused to evade web sites content filters that attempted to remove problematic attributes such as event handlers. If the content filters matched attributes using a regular expression that expected to find trailing whitespace or one of a small set of delimiters.",
    "affected_packages": [
      "www-client/mozilla-firefox",
      "www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin",
      "www-client/seamonkey",
      "www-client/seamonkey-bin"
    ],
    "vulnerability": "Improper parsing of invalid HTML characters in attribute names.",
    "impact": "An attacker could bypass content filters by injecting attributes containing invalid trailing characters, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other vulnerabilities.",
    "attack_vector": "By crafting a malicious web page with HTML attributes containing invalid trailing characters.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to create a web page with crafted HTML content that exploits the vulnerability.",
     "root_cause": "The Mozilla parser incorrectly ignored invalid trailing characters in HTML tag attribute names, allowing specially crafted attributes to bypass filters designed to prevent XSS attacks.",
    "weakness": "Improper input validation in the HTML parser."
