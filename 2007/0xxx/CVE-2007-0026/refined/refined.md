  "CVE-2007-0026": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability in the way that Microsoft Windows handles OLE objects embedded within RTF documents may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "Windows OLE Dialog components do not perform sufficient validation when parsing OLE objects embedded within RTF files. When a user interacts with a malformed embedded OLE Object within an RTF file, it may corrupt system memory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of OLE objects within RTF files.",
      "Memory corruption vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user who opened the file. This could allow the attacker to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Convincing a user to open a specially crafted RTF document containing a malformed OLE object.",
       "Opening a malicious RTF attachment in an e-mail message and then interact with an embedded OLE object."
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malformed OLE object embedded within an RTF file. They also need to convince the user to open the malicious file, which may be done through social engineering or website hosting.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is triggered upon user interaction with the malformed embedded OLE object. The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through a web based attack or through e-mail unless the user opens the file and interacts with the embedded object."
