## Microsoft Windows fails to properly handle malformed OLE objects embedded in RTF documents

#### Vulnerability Note VU#497756

Original Release Date: 2007-02-14 | Last Revised: 2007-02-23

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way that Microsoft Windows handles OLE objects embedded within RTF documents may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) is a technology that allows applications to create and edit compound documents. Compound documents are those consisting of one format, that contain embeddings of (or links to) documents of another format.  Microsoft Windows fails to properly handle a malformed OLE object embedded in a Rich Text Format (RTF) document. An attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to open a specially crafted RTF document that includes an embedded malformed OLE object. Note that on Windows, Wordpad.exe is the default handler for RTF documents. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**Microsoft has addressed this vulnerability in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-011](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-011.mspx). |
| --- |

| **Do not open untrusted RTF documents**Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected RTF (.rtf) documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip [ST04-010](http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-010.html).  **Block Embedded Object in Wordpad**For instructions on how to Enable Embedded Object blocking in Wordpad, refer to the workarounds section of Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-011](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-011.mspx).**Uninstall WordPad** According to Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-011](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-011.mspx) uninstalling WordPad will block the parsing of embedded objects within Rich Text Files. |

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves a newly discovered, privately reported, vulnerability. The vulnerability is documented in the "Vulnerability Details" section of this bulletin.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. Significant user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

We recommend that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 | Windows XP Service Pack 2 | Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OLE Dialog Memory Corruption Vulnerability - [CVE-2007-0026](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2007-0026) | Remote Code Execution | Important | Important | Important |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Note** The security updates for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, and Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition also apply to Windows Server 2003 R2.

**Note** The severity ratings for non-x86 operating system versions map to the x86 operating systems versions as follows:

* The Windows XP Professional x64 Edition severity rating is the same as the Windows XP Service Pack 2 severity rating.
* The Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 severity rating.
* The Windows Server 2003 with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 severity rating.
* The Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 severity rating.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Does this security update remove the same vulnerability as those addressed in MS07-012 and MS07-013?**

No, each individual security bulletin addresses unique security vulnerabilities in different software components; however, similarities do exist between the three security bulletins in how an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities. It should be noted that MS07-011 (*OLE*) includes a defense-in-depth improvement that helps to block known attack vectors to the vulnerability addressed in MS07-012 (*MFC*). Even with the MS07-011 defense-in-depth improvement Microsoft strongly recommends that all three security updates be deployed to address all known vulnerabilities.

**Do I need to deploy this security update before MS07-012 and MS07-013?**

No, the security update in the three security bulletins can be deployed in any order. There are no application compatibility dependencies between the security updates in the three security bulletins.

**Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 1a, Windows XP Media Center Edition 2002 Service Pack 1, Windows XP Media Center Edition 2004 Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 1a, and Windows XP Tablet PC Edition Service Pack 1 ended on October 10, 2006. I am still using one of these operating systems; what should I do?**

## Vulnerability Details

#### OLE Dialog Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0026:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the OLE Dialog component provided with Microsoft Windows. An attacker could attempt to exploit this vulnerability when a user interacts with a malformed embedded OLE object within a Rich Text Format (RTF) file or a Rich Text e-mail message.

#### Mitigating Factors for OLE Dialog Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0026:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* An attacker could only exploit this vulnerability when a user opens and then interacts with an embedded OLE object within a Rich Text Format (RTF) file or a Rich Text e-mail message.
* This vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an RTF file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince the user to open the file.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message and then interact with an embedded OLE object within a Rich Text Format (RTF) file, or interact with an embedded OLE object within a Rich Text e-mail message.

#### Workarounds for OLE Dialog Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0026:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Enable Embedded Object blocking in Wordpad.exe**

  **Note:** This workaround only applies to Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2, Microsoft Windows Server 2003, and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 systems.

  Wordpad.exe is the default application used to open Rich Text files. Users can temporarily block the parsing of embedded objects within Rich Text Files.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  We recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.

  Use the following text to create a .reg file that will automate editing of the registry to temporarily block the parsing of embedded objects with Rich Text Files when using Wordpad.exe. You can copy the following text, paste it into a text editor such as Notepad, and then save the file with the .reg file name extension. Run the .reg file on the vulnerable client.

  **Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00**

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\RtfStreamIn\ObjectBlocking\wordpad.exe]

  **Impact of Workaround:** Wordpad.exe will no longer parse embedded objects within Rich Text files.
* Do not open or save RTF files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
* **Un-install WordPad from Windows 2000 or Windows 2003**

  Wordpad.exe is the default application used to open Rich Text files. By uninstalling WordPad, users can block the parsing of embedded objects within Rich Text Files.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Control Panel**, and then click **Add or Remove Programs**.
  2. Click **Add/Remove Windows Components**, double-click **Accessories and Utilities**, and then double-click **Accessories**.
  3. Uncheck **Wordpad**, click **Okay** to let the Optional Component manager uninstall Wordpad.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Wordpad will no longer parse embedded objects within Rich Text files.

#### FAQ for OLE Dialog Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0026:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the OLE Dialog component provided with Microsoft Windows. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when a user interacts with a malformed embedded OLE object within a Rich Text Format (RTF) file, or a Rich Text e-mail message. If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative rights.

**What is Rich Text Format (RTF)?**

The Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification provides a format for text and graphics interchange that can be used with different output devices, operating environments, and operating systems.

**What is OLE?**

By using OLE technology, an application can provide embedding and linking support. OLE is the technology that applications use to create and edit compound documents. These are documents of one format, such as a Microsoft Word document, that contain embeddings of (or links to) documents of another format, such as Microsoft Excel. OLE 2.0 takes OLE even further by allowing in-place editing. Instead of launching a new application when an OLE object is activated, the user instead sees a new set of menu items inside their existing application. For more information about OLE, visit the following MSDN Web site.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Windows OLE Dialog components do not perform sufficient validation when parsing OLE objects embedded within RTF files. When a user interacts with a malformed embedded OLE Object within an RTF file, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause arbitrary code to run with the privileges of the user who opened the file.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could only exploit this vulnerability when a user opens and then interacts with an embedded OLE object within a Rich Text Format (RTF) file or a Rich Text e-mail message.

This vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an RTF file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince the user to open the file.

The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message and then interact with an embedded OLE object within the RTF file, or interact with an embedded OLE object within a Rich Text e-mail message.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Windows OLE Dialog component parses OLE streams within RTF files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB926436\Filelist

  For Windows XP Professional x64 Edition:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP Version 2003\SP2\KB926436\Filelist

  **Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 926436 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Server 2003 (all versions)

**Prerequisites**
This security update requires Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1.

**Note** The security updates for Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 also apply to Microsoft Windows Server 2003 R2.

**Inclusion in Future Service Packs**
The update for this issue will be included in future Service Pack or Update Rollup.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and forces other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Displays a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstallation. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log: path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Deployment Information**

To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows Server 2003:

**Windowsserver2003-kb926436-x86-enu /quiet**

**Note** Use of the **/quiet** switch will suppress all messages. This includes suppressing failure messages. Administrators should use one of the supported methods to verify the installation was successful when they use the **/quiet** switch. Administrators should also review the KB926436.log file for any failure messages when they use this switch.

To install the security update without forcing the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows Server 2003:

**Windowsserver2003-kb926436-x86-enu /norestart**

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

# Security Update Severity Rating System

Attacks that impact customers' systems rarely result from attackers' exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Rather, they exploit vulnerabilities for which patches are available but not applied. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that customers make patching a priority. Currently available updates are listed in the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/).

However, not all vulnerabilities are equally severe. To help customers understand the risk associated with each vulnerability we patch, we have published a severity rating system that rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome were that vulnerability to be exploited.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution ***without*** user interaction. These scenarios include self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Critical updates immediately. |
| Important | A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where client is compromised ***with***warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt's provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Important updates at the earliest opportunity. |
| Moderate | Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability only to non-default configurations.  Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update. |
| Low | Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems. |

The measure of a vulnerability’s severity is distinct from the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. To assess that likelihood, the [Microsoft Exploitability Index](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc998259) provides additional information to help customers better prioritize the deployment of Microsoft security updates. This index provides customers with guidance on the likelihood of functioning exploit code being developed for vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft security updates, within the first thirty days of that update's release.

While this severity rating system is intended to provide a broadly objective assessment of each issue, we strongly encourage customers to evaluate their own environments and make decisions about which updates are required to protect their systems.
