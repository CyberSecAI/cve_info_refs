### MOAB-10-01-2007: Apple DMG UFS ffs\_mountfs() Integer Overflow Vulnerability

> The ffs\_mountfs() function, part of the UFS filesystem handling code (shared between FreeBSD and Mac OS X XNU) is affected by an integer overflow vulnerability, leading to an exploitable denial of service condition and potential arbitrary code execution.

For further information:

* [Apple DMG UFS ffs\_mountfs() Integer Overflow Vulnerability](http://projects.info-pull.com/moab/MOAB-10-01-2007.html)
* Proof of concept: [MOAB-10-01-2007.dmg.gz](http://projects.info-pull.com/moab/bug-files/MOAB-10-01-2007.dmg.gz)

Note: Apple requested confirmation more than one month ago, when [the original FreeBSD UFS vulnerabilities](http://projects.info-pull.com/mokb/MOKB-03-11-2006.html) [got published](http://projects.info-pull.com/mokb/MOKB-08-11-2006.html) in the MoKB. This serves as confirmation that the issues obviously exist in both XNU and FreeBSD. It wasn't that difficult to verify, given that the UFS code is exactly the same in both.

We'll be releasing kernel-related issues for some time (mixed with remote user-land issues, just to keep it fun). Mostly DMG related flaws that didn't make it to the [MoKB](http://projects.info-pull.com/mokb/) schedule.

So far, this project has proven very necessary. Back in 94-98 everyone did the same with Linux and Solaris.

The fact that people are STILL writing codes containing simple buffer and integer overflows in 2006/7 is a disgrace.

So is it disregard for security vs cash flow? Or is this a continuance of failure at the universities (ie: focus on high level languages) ?

Well said. I would have to agree.

The problem we will be seeing soon is that many low-level issues will come up (such as the huge advances we need to make in parallel filesystems or [insert next device here, which will suck because the software sucks]). Its begining to look like there wont be many firefighters left to put fires out. Every student coming out of most colleges (exclude MIT, UCB, and so on) can write in C++ (some), Java, and pick your fav scripting language (whats the fanboy language these days? Python? Ruby?). You can forget C, and ASM.

I dont know where this complete abstraction mentality came from. Microsoft? Apple? Either way, I think it was taken a bit too literally. It must have come from California (BSD, LSD, and abstraction ;) ).

Am I understanding correctly?

According to secunia for MOAB-10
"NOTE: This is only remotely exploitable via the Safari web browser when the "opening safe files after downloading" option is enabled."

So in safari, if we had open safe files checked, this means that upon visiting a website, a dmg could be forced downloaded to computer and mounted.

If open safe files is unchecked, you would need to, after the download is complete, mount the dmg yourself making this a local exploit since your interaction is required to mount dmg?

These folks are establishing themselves as careless, alarmist, and
uneducated when it comes to kernel bugs.

In FreeBSD, the above mentioned flaws can, indeed, cause a kernel panic.
However, this is intended behaviour when a corrupt filesystem is
encountered.  It protects the system from serious damage that could
result from trying to work with the corrupt filesystem.

The difference, that the info-pull folks seem to be too stupid to
understand, is that FreeBSD does not allow mounting of filesystems
by anyone other than root.  If someone with root access wants to
DoS your system, then don't need any flaws, they could just rm -rf /,
or other nasty actions.

Apple made the mistake of making a function that was designed to be
usable by an administrator-only accessible to the average user.  Doing
this requires that lots and lots of code be investigated and updated.
Places where it makes sense to intentionally call panic() in FreeBSD
require less drastic and considerably more complex action in Mac OS.
Apparently, Apple didn't review this carefully enough.

The thing that amazes me is that the info-pull folks are smart enough
to uncover these issues, but too stupid to accurately report them and
their consequences.

-Bill

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
