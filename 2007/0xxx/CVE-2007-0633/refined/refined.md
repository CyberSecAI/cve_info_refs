```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `themefunc.php` file within the MyNews application. Specifically, the `myNewsConf[path][sys][index]` parameter is used in a `require` statement without sufficient validation, allowing remote file inclusion.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI).
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include a malicious remote file, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. This could result in complete compromise of the vulnerable web server, data theft, and other malicious activities.
- Attack vectors: By sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable script (`themefunc.php`) with a malicious URL in the `myNewsConf[path][sys][index]` parameter, an attacker can force the server to include the specified remote file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the target server.
