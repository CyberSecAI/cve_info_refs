{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the `shared_region_map_file_np()` function within the Apple Mac OS X 10.4.x kernel. Specifically, it's caused by a lack of bounds checking when handling the `mapping_count` parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient bounds checking",
      "Memory corruption vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a local compromise of the vulnerable system, resulting in consumption of all available operating system resources.",
    "attack_vector": "Local system call to `shared_region_map_file_np()`",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to make system calls to the vulnerable function."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability can be triggered by calling the `shared_region_map_file_np()` system call with a high `mapping_count` value. The provided proof-of-concept code demonstrates how to trigger this vulnerability."
