Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-0129

**Vulnerable Software:** LocazoList <= v2.01a beta5

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `subcatID` parameter in the `main.asp` page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:**  The application directly incorporates the user-supplied `subcatID` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords. In this case, the exploit shows how to extract data from the `admin` table.
*   **Complete Database Compromise:** It's likely that an attacker could manipulate the database and potentially gain full control.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable application.
*  **Malicious SQL Code:** The `subcatID` parameter is injected with malicious SQL code such as `union select` statements to retrieve data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft the injection payloads.

**Additional Information**
* The exploit provides specific example URLs for exploitation.
* The vulnerability affects versions of LocazoList up to and including v2.01a beta5.
* The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on 2007-01-03.
