How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft Internet Explorer VML buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#122084

Original Release Date: 2007-01-09 | Last Revised: 2007-01-18

---

### Overview

Microsoft Internet Explorer ([IE](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx)) fails to properly handle Vector Markup Language tags. This vulnerability may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft IE version 5.0 and higher supports the Vector Markup Language [(VML](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/vml/SHAPE/introduction.asp)), which is a set of XML tags for drawing vector graphics. IE fails to properly handle malformed VML tags allowing a buffer overflow to occur. If a remote attacker can persuade a user to access a specially crafted web page with IE, that attacker may be able to trigger the buffer overflow. In addition, an attacker could deliver an HTML email message or entice a user to select an HTML document in Windows Explorer.  Note that this vulnerability is actively being exploited. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment), a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could also cause Internet Explorer (or the program using the WebBrowser control) to crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply the update from Microsoft**Microsoft addresses this vulnerability with the update listed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-004](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS07-004.mspx). |
| --- |

| **Disable VML support**  Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-004](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS07-004.mspx) suggests the following techniques to disable VML support:     + Un-register Vgx.dll on Windows XP Service Pack 1; Windows XP Service Pack 2; Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 + Modify the Access Control List on Vgx.dll to be more restrictive + Configure Internet Explorer 6 for Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 to disable Binary and Script Behaviors in the Internet and Local Intranet security zone  **Do not follow unsolicited links**In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. **Disable Active Scripting**Although this vulnerability does not require Active Scripting to be enabled, known exploits targeting this issue use Active Scripting to place malicious code on a vulnerable system. To block this attack vector, it is recommended that Active Scripting be disabled. For instructions on how to disable Active Scripting in Microsoft Internet Explorer, please refer to the Internet Explorer section of the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/) document. **Read and send email in plain text format**An attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to open a specially crafted HTML email. Only reading email in plaintext will prevent exploitation of this vulnerability through email. Consider the security of fellow Internet users and send email in plain text format when possible. If you use Microsoft Outlook, we encourage you to apply the Outlook Email Security Update. The update configures Outlook to open email messages in the Restricted Sites Zone, where Active scripting is disabled by default. In addition, the update provides further protection against malicious code that attempts to propagate via Outlook. The Outlook Email Security Update is available for [Outlook 98](http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/9798/Out98sec.aspx) and [Outlook 2000](http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/Out2ksec.aspx). The functionality of the Outlook Email Security Update is included in Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6. Outlook 2003 includes these and other security enhancements. **Configure Windows Explorer to use Windows Classic Folders**When Windows Explorer is configured to use the "Show common tasks in folders" option, HTML within a file may be processed when that file is selected. If the "Show common tasks in folders" is enabled, selecting a specially crafted HTML document in Windows Explorer may trigger this vulnerability. Note that the "Show common tasks in folders" is enabled by default. To mitigate this attack vector, enable the "Use Windows classic folders" option. To enable this option in Windows Explorer:    + Open Windows Explorer + Select Folder Options from the Tools menu + Select the "Use Windows classic folders" option in the Tasks section |

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Are there any additional issues related to the workarounds provided in this Bulletin?**

If the âModify the Access Control List on vgx.dll to be more restrictiveâ workaround is applied, software that redistributes vgx.dll may fail to install. An example of this is [Windows Internet Explorer 7](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx). Before this software can be installed, the workaround must be reverted to the previous ACL configuration for vgx.dll.

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces a prior security update. The security bulletin ID and affected operating systems are listed in the following table.

| Bulletin ID | Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 | Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 with Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 Installed | Windows XP Service Pack 2 | Windows Server 2003 | Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [**MS06-055**](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms06-055) | Replaced | Replaced | Replaced | Replaced | Replaced |

**Why are the security updates for Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 labeled as Internet Explorer updates?**

While this is a security update for Windows, the files are serviced from the Internet Explorer code base on these platforms. As such, it follows Internet Explorer standards for packaging as well as detection and deployment.

**What is the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?**

Internet Explorer [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx) is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or of an administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying many security-related settings. This includes the settings on the **Security** tab and the **Advanced** tab in the **Internet Options** dialog box. Some of the important modifications include the following:

* Security level for the Internet zone is set to **High**. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), and file downloads.
* Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.
* Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.
* Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.

The Internet Explorer [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx) does not provide mitigation for applications like Microsoft Outlook which can be installed on Windows Server 2003.

**What is the** **Enterprise** **Update Scan Tool (EST)?**

As part of an ongoing commitment to provide detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft delivers a stand-alone detection tool whenever the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and the Office Detection Tool (ODT) cannot detect whether the update is required for an MSRC release cycle. This stand-alone tool is called the Enterprise Update Scan Tool (EST) and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a version of the Enterprise Update Scan Tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers can run the tool from a command line interface (CLI) and view the results of the XML output file. To help customers better utilize the tool, detailed documentation will be provided with the tool. There is also a version of the tool that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.

**Can I use a version of the** **Enterprise** **Update Scan Tool (EST) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. Microsoft has created a version of the EST that will determine if you have to apply this update. For download links and more information about the version of the EST that is being released this month, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193). SMS customers should review the "Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?" FAQ for more information about SMS and EST.

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

The following table provides the SMS detection summary for this security update.

## Vulnerability Details

#### VML Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0024:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Vector Markup Language (VML) implementation in Microsoft Windows. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page or HTML e-mail that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited the Web page or viewed the message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for VML Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0024:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* In an e-mail based attack of this exploit, customers who read e-mail in plain text are at less risk from this vulnerability. Instead users would have to either click on a link that would take them to a malicious Web site or open an attachment to be at risk from this vulnerability.
* In an e-mail based attack of this exploit, customers who read e-mail using Outlook Express on Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2, are at less risk from this vulnerability because Binary and Script Behaviors is disabled by default in the Restricted sites zone.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability in Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 because Binary and Script Behaviors is disabled by default in the Internet zone.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability in the e-mail vector for Outlook Express because reading e-mail messages in plain text is the default configuration. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for VML Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0024:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Unregister VGX.DLL**

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **"%SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe" -u "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll"**, and then click **OK**.
  2. A dialog box appears to confirm that the un-registration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Applications that render VML will no longer do so once vgx.dll has been unregistered.

  This security update does not automatically re-register vgx.dll so any applications that render VML will no longer do so until vgx.dll has been re-registered. To re-register vgx.dll follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **"%SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe" "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll"**, and then click **OK**.
  2. A dialog box appears to confirm that the registration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box.
* **Modify the Access Control List on VGX.DLL to be more restrictive**

  Applying this workaround may cause the installation of security updates provided with this security bulletin to fail:

  To modify the Access Control List (ACL) on vgx.dll to be more restrictive, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**cmd**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. Type the following command at a command prompt make a note of the current ACLâs that are on the file (including inheritance settings) for future reference to undo this modification:
     cacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll"
  3. Type the following command at a command prompt to deny the âeveryoneâ group access to this file:
     echo y| cacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll" /d everyone
  4. Close Internet Explorer, and reopen it for the changes to take effect.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Applications and Web sites that render VML may no longer display or function correctly.

  Before this security update can be installed, this workaround must be reverted to the previous ACL configuration for vgx.dll. To revert to the previous vgx.dll ACLâs follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**cmd**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. To revert to the previous ACL configuration for vgx.dll, type the following command and replace the ACL on vgx.dll with the ACLâs it previously had, which were recorded in step 2 of this workaround The command line to do so will vary depending on your environment:
     echo y| cacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll" /g *original ACLâs*
  3. Close Internet Explorer, and reopen it for the changes to take effect.

  **Note** If this workaround is applied, software that redistributes vgx.dll may fail to install. An example of this is [Internet Explorer 7 Release Candidate 1](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx) and subsequent versions of Windows Internet Explorer 7. Before this software can be installed, this workaround must be reverted to the previous ACL configuration for vgx.dll.

  **Note** Customers wishing to revert to the default installed ACL configuration for vgx.dll, type the following:
* For Windows 2000 Service Pack 4:
  echo y| cacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll" /P BUILTIN\Users:R "BUILTIN\Power Users:C" BUILTIN\Administrators:F "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:F"
* For Windows XP Service Pack 2:
  echo y| cacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll" /P BUILTIN\Users:R "BUILTIN\Power Users:C" BUILTIN\Administrators:F "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:F"
* For Windows 2003 and Windows 2003 Service Pack 1:
  echo y| cacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll" /P BUILTIN\Users:R "BUILTIN\Power Users:C" BUILTIN\Administrators:F "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:F" âNT AUTHORITY\TERMINAL SERVER USER:Câ
* **Configure Internet Explorer 6 for Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 to disable Binary and Script Behaviors in the Internet and Local Intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to disable binary and script behaviors in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Binary and Script Behaviors**, click **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Binary and Script Behaviors**, click **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Disabling binary and script behaviors in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites that rely on VML to not function correctly.
* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
* **Block VML Vulnerability Traffic with ISA Server**

  Customers with Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2004 or 2006 may also block malicious traffic intended to exploit this vulnerability. For more information about how to enable this setting in ISA Server, see [Learn How Your ISA Server Helps Block VML Vulnerability Traffic](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=74025).

In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

In an e-mail based attack of this exploit, customers who read e-mail in plain text are at less risk from this vulnerability. Instead users would have to either click on a link that would take them to a malicious Web site or open an attachment to be at risk from this vulnerability.

Customers who read e-mail in plain text would also be at less risk when using the Outlook or Outlook Express preview panes.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail messages or is visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail messages are read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**What is the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?**

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or of an administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying many security-related settings. This includes the settings on the **Security** tab and the **Advanced** tab in the **Internet Options** dialog box. Some of the important modifications include the following:

* Security level for the Internet zone is set to **High**. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), and file downloads.
* Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.
* Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.
* Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.

For more information regarding Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration, see the guide, Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration, at the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=d41b036c-e2e1-4960-99bb-9757f7e9e31b&displaylang;=en%20https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=d41b036c-e2e1-4960-99bb-9757f7e9e31b&displaylang;=en).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Windows validates the length of data before storing it in the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft *originally* received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. When the security bulletin was released, Microsoft had received information that this vulnerability was being exploited.

**Does applying this security update help protect customers from the code that has been published publicly that attempts to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. This security update addresses the vulnerability that is currently being exploited. The vulnerability that has been addressed has been assigned the Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CVE-2007-0024.

**How does this vulnerability relate to the vulnerability that is corrected by MS06-055?**

While both vulnerabilities were in VML, this update addresses a new vulnerability that was not addressed as part of MS06-055. MS06-055 helps protect against the vulnerability that is discussed in that bulletin, but does not address this new vulnerability. You must install this update to help protect your system against both vulnerabilities.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the frequently asked question, âCan I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?â in the section, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update, earlier in this bulletin.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  For Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB929969\Filelist

  For Windows XP Professional x64 Edition:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP Version 2003\SP2\KB929969\Filelist

  **Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 929969 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Internet Explorer 7 for Windows XP Service Pack 2 (all versions)

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  Windows Server 2003, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition; Windows Small Business Server 2003; Windows Server 2003, Web Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Standard x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise x64 Edition; and Windows Server 2003, Datacenter x64 Edition:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP0\KB929969\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 929969 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

**Revisions:**

* V1.0 (January 9, 2007): Bulletin published.
* V1.1 (January 10, 2007): Bulletin updated: âRestart Requirementâ updated for each update to properly reflect that restarts are not required if the affected file, vgx.dll, is not in use.
* V1.2 (May 22, 2007): Bulletin updated to reflect that Windows Internet Explorer 7 on Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 is an affected component, same as Windows Internet Explorer 7 on Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1. The vgx.dll version installed with Windows Internet Explorer 7 is a major-version higher than vgx.dll included in Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2. Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 is not-affected by this vulnerability as released. Therefore, customers who install Windows Internet Explorer 7 on Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 will also need to apply this security update.

# Security Update Severity Rating System

Attacks that impact customers' systems rarely result from attackers' exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Rather, they exploit vulnerabilities for which patches are available but not applied. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that customers make patching a priority. Currently available updates are listed in the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/).

However, not all vulnerabilities are equally severe. To help customers understand the risk associated with each vulnerability we patch, we have published a severity rating system that rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome were that vulnerability to be exploited.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution ***without*** user interaction. These scenarios include self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Critical updates immediately. |
| Important | A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where client is compromised ***with***warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt's provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Important updates at the earliest opportunity. |
| Moderate | Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability only to non-default configurations.  Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update. |
| Low | Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems. |

The measure of a vulnerability’s severity is distinct from the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. To assess that likelihood, the [Microsoft Exploitability Index](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc998259) provides additional information to help customers better prioritize the deployment of Microsoft security updates. This index provides customers with guidance on the likelihood of functioning exploit code being developed for vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft security updates, within the first thirty days of that update's release.

While this severity rating system is intended to provide a broadly objective assessment of each issue, we strongly encourage customers to evaluate their own environments and make decisions about which updates are required to protect their systems.
