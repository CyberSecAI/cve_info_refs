Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-0024:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Windows handles Vector Markup Language (VML). Specifically, the VML implementation fails to properly validate the length of data before storing it in a buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow. This occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The VML parsing logic lacks proper validation of input data, allowing an attacker to craft malicious VML that triggers the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   **Complete System Control:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability with administrative user rights could gain complete control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new user accounts.
*   **Application Crash:** The vulnerability can also cause Internet Explorer or other programs using the WebBrowser control to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Pages:** An attacker could host a malicious web page containing specially crafted VML code. If a user visits this page using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer or another vulnerable component using the WebBrowser control, the overflow can be triggered.
*   **HTML Email:**  An attacker could send a crafted HTML email message. If a user opens the email, the vulnerability can be triggered. Attackers might also entice a user to select an HTML document in Windows Explorer, leading to exploitation if the 'Show common tasks in folders' option is enabled.
*   **Compromised websites:** A compromised legitimate website or a website that accepts user provided content could be leveraged by an attacker to host the malicious VML code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote and doesn't require any prior access to the victim's machine.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any credentials or prior authentication.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to persuade a user to visit a malicious web page, open a crafted HTML email or select a malicious HTML document in Windows Explorer.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is actively exploited in the wild.
*   Microsoft has released a security update (MS07-004) to address this vulnerability.
*   Microsoft provides workarounds for mitigating the risk before applying the official patch like unregistering VGX.DLL, modifying Access Control Lists on VGX.DLL and configuring Internet Explorer to disable Binary and Script Behaviors.

This vulnerability is critical due to the potential for remote code execution without user interaction (in some attack scenarios), leading to complete system compromise. The attack vectors are relatively easy to exploit, especially with social engineering techniques to lure users to malicious websites or emails.
