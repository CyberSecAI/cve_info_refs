# [VIM] VERIFY of RFI and XSS in OpenEMR 2.8.2 (was [still bogus] V [mike at carstein.kill-9.pl: Re: Open Conference Systems = 2.8.2 Remote File Inclusion])

No, this is not the case. The report is perfectly valid as shown
through later Bugtraq discussions.

This post is for VIM accuracy and completeness, as well as
to demonstrate the problems with post-disclosure analysis.

Problem 1 (researcher):
The researcher claims that there is a RFI in import_xml.php in
Open Conference Systems (ocs). A look at the example RFI shows
that the problem is actually within OpenEMR 2.8.2:

<http://localhost/ocs/openemr-2.8.2/custom/import_xml.php?srcdir=evilcod>
e

Problem 2 (post-disclosure analyst):
Looking at custom/import_xml.php in OpenEMR 2.8.2 (lines 13-15):
> include_once("../interface/globals.php");
> include_once("$srcdir/patient.inc");
> include_once("$srcdir/acl.inc");

Now tracing back into interface/globals.php:
> $GLOBALS['srcdir'] = "$webserver_root/library";  // line 24
> ...
> $srcdir = $GLOBALS['srcdir']; // line 119

** So at this point we have an apparent dispute.**

However, continuing further into interface/globals.php (lines 240-245):
> // required for normal operation because of recent changes in PHP:
> $ps = strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'],"myadmin");
> if ($ps === false) {
>     extract($_GET);
>     extract($_POST);
> }

** WHOOPS. The vendor did do the right thing, until those two little
extract statements
were slipped in for "normal operation".**

===================================================================

Additionally, in followup Bugtraq discussions.
There is a XSS in the rootdir parameter in
interface/login/login_frame.php.
This is also confirmed and stems from the same variable overwrite issue
that
caused the above RFI.

This report came up on the weekend and had some conflicting data. The version
was wrong for the software specified, and the scipt didnt exist. This new
report points to the correct software. However, the report is still bogus
as a configruation file (globals.php) called at the beginning of the
script clearly defines the specified vulnerable parameter.

This bug has nothing to do with Open Conference System. This is a bug in
OpenEMR (<http://http://www.oemr.org/>)
