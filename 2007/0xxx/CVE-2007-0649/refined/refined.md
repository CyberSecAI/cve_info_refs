Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0649:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `extract($_GET)` and `extract($_POST)` in `interface/globals.php` within OpenEMR 2.8.2. This allows an attacker to overwrite the `$srcdir` variable, which is normally set to the web server root directory, with a value provided through the `srcdir` GET parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** By manipulating the `$srcdir` variable, an attacker can include arbitrary remote files using the `import_xml.php` script in the `custom` directory. This occurs because `import_xml.php` includes files based on the attacker-controlled `$srcdir` variable.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A similar overwrite vulnerability also exists for the `rootdir` parameter within `interface/login/login_frame.php`, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **RFI:** Successful RFI exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **XSS:** Successful XSS exploitation could allow an attacker to steal user session data, deface websites, or redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **RFI:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to `import_xml.php` with a malicious URL in the `srcdir` parameter.
*   **XSS:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to `login_frame.php` with malicious JavaScript code in the `rootdir` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **RFI:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable OpenEMR instance and have a publicly accessible malicious file hosted on a remote server.
*  **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable OpenEMR instance.

**Additional Notes**
* The initial report of the vulnerability incorrectly attributed the issue to Open Conference Systems (OCS), but it was later determined that the vulnerability exists in OpenEMR.
* The use of `extract()` with user-supplied parameters is a known unsafe practice, and this case demonstrates how it can lead to serious vulnerabilities.

**CVE-2007-0649 is associated with the RFI vulnerability in OpenEMR's `import_xml.php` and the XSS in login\_frame.php as a consequence of the same flawed logic.**
