{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in FlashFXP when handling a long PWD command.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a buffer overflow that is triggered by a long PWD command with more than 5420 '/' characters separated by at least one other character. This can lead to denial of service (DoS).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The application initially freezes for about 45 seconds consuming 100% CPU resources. If the user disconnects and reconnects to the server, the application enters an infinite loop trying to write data to the stack, leading to a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is sending a specially crafted PWD command via the FTP protocol to the FlashFXP server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP server and send commands to the FlashFXP server. No specific user privileges are required."
