{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `user` parameter of `user.asp`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive information from the database (such as usernames and passwords), and potentially gain further access to the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP by sending a crafted request to `user.asp` with malicious SQL code in the `user` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application to send HTTP requests to the `user.asp` file."
