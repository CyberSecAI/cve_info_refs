Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from improper sanitization of trackback entries when decoding them with alternate character sets. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL into WordPress database queries.
- Additionally, the vulnerability includes an information disclosure issue due to different error messages in `wp-login.php`, which reveal whether a user exists.
- There is also a cross-site scripting vulnerability related to unsanitized file information in `/wp-admin/templates.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization of trackback data leads to SQL injection vulnerability.
2.  **Information Disclosure:** Different error messages during login expose user existence.
3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Unsanitized file information in the admin panel leads to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** An attacker could inject arbitrary SQL commands into the WordPress database, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized data modification, or complete compromise of the database.
2.  **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could determine if specific users exist on the WordPress system which makes brute force password attacks easier.
3. **XSS:** An attacker could inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code, which would be executed in the browsers of users viewing the `/wp-admin/templates.php` page which could lead to session hijacking and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. **SQL Injection:** Sending specially crafted trackbacks with alternate character sets to a WordPress site.
2. **Information Disclosure:** Attempting to log in with different usernames to observe error messages from `wp-login.php`.
3. **XSS:** An attacker, authenticated to view the admin area, would edit a file with a malicious filename.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** Requires the ability to send trackbacks to the WordPress installation.
2.  **Information Disclosure:** Requires network access to the WordPress login page.
3. **XSS:** Requires administrative access to the WordPress instance.
