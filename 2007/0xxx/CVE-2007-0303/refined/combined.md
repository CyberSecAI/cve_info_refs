## Series Highlights

* **Logging and stats [DB]**
* **Podcast support**
* **Support for extra song options like lyrics, tabs, etc.**
* **Internal caching options**

**Requires at least PHP 4.1.x (recommend: magic\_quotes\_gpc OFF / register\_globals OFF).**

**NOTES:** This series adds optional features like statistics, logging and voting that require a database. It will function like the 0.11.x series without a database, i.e. the database is optional.
