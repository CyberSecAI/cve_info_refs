Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0784:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from SQL injection flaws within "RBL - ASP" scripts, specifically in the user authentication process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The code directly concatenates user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This is evident in the following code snippets:
    - `sql = "select A.* from x_User A Where A.idUser =" & uId & " AND A.sPassword = '" & Request("_pass") & "'"` (from `user_confirm.asp`)
    - `sql = "SELECT * FROM tUser WHERE sCode ='" & sUser & "' AND sPassword='" & sPass & "' "` (from `login.asp`)
- The use of `Request()` and `Request.Form()` directly without sanitization makes the application vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass authentication by injecting SQL code into the `user` and `pass` or similar parameters. For example, using `'or'='` as both username and password.
- **Data Exposure:** Successful SQL injection can allow attackers to access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests. Attackers manipulate user input fields (like username and password) that are used in the login process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameters that are used in the SQL query
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists in multiple scripts as indicated by source code snippets.
- The provided information references `aspside.com` as the site related to the vulnerable scripts.
- The dork `intitle:"RBL - ASP"` can be used to identify vulnerable applications
- The severity is medium, with a CVSS base score of 7.5/10 and an exploitability subscore of 10/10.
