Researcher: sn0oPy
Ref: BUGTRAQ RBL - ASP (scripts with db) SQL injection
     <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/458560/100/0/threaded>

The referenced vendor site was casually examined to try to infer
actual product names.  tUrl was examined, but egrep "user|pass"
yielded nothing.

tForum's user_confirm.asp has:

>uId = Request("id")
>
>sql = "select A.* from x_User A Where A.idUser =" & uId & " AND A.sPassword = '" & Request("_pass") & "'"

tpassword's login.asp has:

>		iStatus = Check_Login(Request.Form("User"),Request.Form("Password"))
>
>...
>Function Check_Login(sUser, sPass)
>	Dim rs, sql
>
>	sql = "SELECT * FROM tUser WHERE sCode ='" & sUser & "' AND sPassword='" & sPass & "' "

So looks like at least these two are legit.  I didn't look at the
other products.

- Steve
