{
  "CVE-2007-0248": {
    "Description": "Squid could end up in an endless loop when exhausted of available external ACL helpers. Remote users with access to squid could cause CPU starvation, possibly leading to a denial of service.",
    "Root cause": "Error in the external_acl queue causing an infinite looping condition.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of external ACL helper exhaustion."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service due to CPU starvation.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote users with access to the squid service."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to send requests that exhaust the external ACL helpers.",
        "Additional Information": "This does not affect a default Ubuntu installation, since external ACL helpers must be configured and used."
