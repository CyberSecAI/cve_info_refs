Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-0908:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the PHP WDDX extension's unserialization handler.
*   Specifically, the code does not properly initialize the `key_length` variable when processing a numerical key during deserialization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Uninitialized variable:** The `key_length` variable is not correctly initialized when a numerical key is encountered in the WDDX data. This causes the handler to read data from the stack.
*   **Information Leak:** This leads to an information leak by copying an arbitrary amount of stack data into session array keys.
*   **Lack of Bounds Checking:** The code doesn't correctly check buffer boundaries during unserialization.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially expose sensitive information stored on the stack, including:
    *   Offsets of variables and code
    *   Stack canaries
    *   Potentially sensitive application data
*   **Potential for further attacks:**  The leaked information, particularly offsets, can be used to prepare for more sophisticated attacks that require specific memory addresses.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote exploitation:** This vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Unserialization of untrusted data:**  The vulnerability is triggered by unserializing untrusted WDDX data.
*   **Control over data:** Attackers control the WDDX data being processed by a PHP application

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to send crafted WDDX data:** The attacker needs the ability to provide the PHP application with maliciously constructed WDDX data, which typically occurs in the context of session handling.
*   **No authentication required:**  The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
*   **Low attack complexity:** The exploit is considered to have low attack complexity.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered in the `php_set_session_var` function inside the `HASH_KEY_IS_LONG` case within the WDDX deserializer. The key is written to a 128-byte stack buffer, but `key_length` is not initialized, resulting in a leak of stack data.
*   The amount of leaked bytes can be controlled by the attacker by including a variable with a string name before the numerical index variable, allowing the attacker to set `key_length` variable to the length of variable name.
*   The provided content includes a proof-of-concept exploit and a sample of leaked stack data.

**Summary:**

CVE-2007-0908 describes an information leak vulnerability in the PHP WDDX extension stemming from an uninitialized `key_length` variable during unserialization. This enables an attacker to expose potentially sensitive data from the server's memory. This vulnerability is remotely exploitable with low attack complexity.
