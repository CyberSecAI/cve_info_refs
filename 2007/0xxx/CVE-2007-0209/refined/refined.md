  "CVE-2007-0209": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Word. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when Word parses a file and processes a malformed drawing object. Such a specially crafted file might be included as an e-mail attachment or hosted on a malicious Web site. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Word file that could allow remote code execution.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient data validation when Microsoft Word processes a malformed drawing object within a file. Parsing such a malformed object can corrupt system memory, allowing arbitrary code execution.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient data validation of drawing objects"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows remote code execution, potentially giving an attacker complete control over the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Email attachment: A specially crafted Word file can be sent to a user via email.",
      "Web-based attack: A malicious website can host a crafted Word file that exploits the vulnerability."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted Word file with a malformed drawing object and convince a user to open the file or visit a website hosting the file.",
    "Affected software": [
      "Microsoft Office Word 2000",
      "Microsoft Office XP",
       "Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac"
    ],
     "Mitigation": [
        "Users of Microsoft Word 2000 are advised to install the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool.",
        "Users are advised not to open or save Microsoft Word files received from untrusted sources.",
        "Users can use the Microsoft Word Viewer 2003 to open and view files since it is not affected by the vulnerability."
