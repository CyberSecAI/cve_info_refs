Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a security issue in w-agora, a PHP-based web application.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability allows attackers to disclose the contents of the `globals.inc` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The main weakness is the ability to read the `globals.inc` file. This file contains server paths to the main scripts of the application.
*   **Reliance on `register_globals`:** The vulnerability is exploitable only when the PHP setting `register_globals` is turned ON. This setting is considered a security risk and is disabled by default in recent PHP versions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to internal server paths to the main w-agora scripts by reading the content of the `globals.inc` file. This information can potentially be used for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct File Access:** The attacker directly requests the vulnerable `globals.inc` file via HTTP request.
*   **Web Request:** The attacker crafts a web request to the `globals.inc` file within the w-agora directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable w-agora instance.
*   **PHP `register_globals` ON:** The PHP `register_globals` setting on the server must be enabled for the attack to succeed.
*   **Knowledge of w-agora Installation Path:** The attacker needs to know or guess the path where w-agora is installed on the server to access the globals.inc file.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory mentions the vulnerability is specific to w-agora version 4.2.1
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on January 30th 2007, but the vendor did not respond.
*   Workarounds include disabling `register_globals` in PHP configuration, or using an `.htaccess` file to restrict access to `globals.inc`.
*   The advisory provides a sample HTTP request to demonstrate how the vulnerability is exploited.
