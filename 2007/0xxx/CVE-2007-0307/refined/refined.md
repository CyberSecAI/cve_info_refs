{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes a file based on a user-controlled parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The 'rootPath' variable in 'common.php' is not properly sanitized and allows an attacker to include arbitrary files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a URL with a modified 'env[rootPath]' parameter when accessing `include/common.php`, an attacker can specify a remote file to be included and executed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, and have access to a publicly accessible malicious PHP file to include."
