{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a remote file inclusion issue in the `common_foot.php` file, and also in `blogs.php` and `admin/gallery_head.php`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET requests with a crafted `config[path]` or `config[theme]` parameters."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable files with a malicious URL.",
      "additional_information": "The vulnerable files are `common_foot.php`, `blogs.php`, and `admin/gallery_head.php`. The vulnerability exists because the application includes files based on user-controlled parameters (`config['path']` and `config['theme']`) without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to include a remote file from a malicious server."
