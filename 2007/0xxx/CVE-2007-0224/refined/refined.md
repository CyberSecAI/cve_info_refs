Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-0224 (as mentioned in the exploit database entry)

**Vulnerable Software:** VP-ASP Shopping Cart 6.09

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `LoginLastname` parameter within the `shopgiftregsearch.asp` script.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Failure to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied data before using it in a SQL query.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request to `shopgiftregsearch.asp` with a malicious SQL query in the `LoginLastname` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries. This may allow the attacker to extract sensitive data from the database (e.g., email addresses, usernames, passwords, personal information). The exploit example attempts to extract `email` and `lastname` from the `registrant` table.
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `msg` parameter within the `shopcustadmin.asp` script.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Failure to properly encode or sanitize user-supplied data before displaying it in a web page.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request to `shopcustadmin.asp` with a malicious JavaScript payload in the `msg` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page. This may allow the attacker to steal user cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
