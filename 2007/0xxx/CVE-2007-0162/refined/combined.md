## [Month of Apple Bugs - Day 8](http://landonf.org/code/macosx/MOAB_Day_8.20070109002959.18582.timor.html)

08 Jan 2007, 16:29 PST

Today's [Month of Apple Bugs](http://projects.info-pull.com/moab/MOAB-08-01-2007.html) issue exploits Apple's permissions on /Library/Frameworks to implement local admin to root user privilege escalation. Their proof of concept is [Application Enhancer](http://www.unsanity.com/haxies/ape), the tool we've been using to apply run-time patches.

The proof-of-concept local exploit backdoors the aped binary by creating their own replacement framework in /Library/Frameworks. This allows a local administrative user to gain root privileges without supplying authentication credentials. It is the same sort of file system privilege problem that allowed [Apple DiskManagement BOM Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability](http://projects.info-pull.com/moab/MOAB-05-01-2007.html), and the older /Library/StartupItems admin-writability issue.

Like the previous local exploits, this could be combined with a remote exploit to gain root privileges from an administrator account without user interaction. There are also a number of alternate exploit conditions that could occur due to the admin-writability of other directories in /Library.

One work-around:

```
sudo chmod g-w /Library/Frameworks
```

Reversed by running:

```
sudo chmod g+w /Library/Frameworks
```

Running "Repair Permissions" will also reverse the changes, but [see this, first](http://landonf.bikemonkey.org/code/macosx/MOAB_Day_5.20070106032404.8860.zadder.local.html).

I'd like to state that [Unsanity](http://www.unsanity.com/), the authors of [Application Enhancer](http://www.unsanity.com/haxies/ape), have provided considerable assistance, and I have respect for their technical abilities.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
