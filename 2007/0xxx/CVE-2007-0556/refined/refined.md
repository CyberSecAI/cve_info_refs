{
  "CVE-2007-0556": {
    "Description": "PostgreSQL was found to contain a vulnerability in its processing of SQL functions. An authenticated user with permissions to add and drop database tables could potentially exploit this issue to cause the PostgreSQL server process to crash or possibly read data from arbitrary memory locations.",
    "Root cause": "PostgreSQL does not correctly check the data types of the SQL function arguments under unspecified circumstances nor the format of the provided tables in the query planner.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation of SQL function arguments",
       "Improper handling of table formats in the query planner"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote authenticated attacker could send specially crafted queries to the server that could result in a server crash and possibly the unauthorized reading of some database content or arbitrary memory.",
    "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted SQL queries",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Authenticated database user with permissions to add and drop tables."
