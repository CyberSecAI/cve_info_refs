{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input sanitization of the 'ordernum' parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries to gain access to sensitive information such as usernames and passwords or can inject malicious JavaScript to perform actions on behalf of other users, steal cookies, or redirect users to malicious websites.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `search.asp` page, using the `ordernum` parameter",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application. They may need to register and log in before exploiting the vulnerability."
