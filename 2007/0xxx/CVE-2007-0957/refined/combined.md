Debian Security Advisory DSA 1276-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                         Moritz Muehlenhoff
April 3th, 2007                         <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : krb5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-0956 CVE-2007-0957 CVE-2007-1216

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MIT reference
implementation of the Kerberos network authentication protocol suite,
which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-0956

    It was discovered that the krb5 telnet daemon performs insufficient
    validation of usernames, which might allow unauthorized logins or
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2007-0957

    iDefense discovered that a buffer overflow in the logging code of the
    KDC and the administration daemon might lead to arbitrary code
    execution.

CVE-2007-1216

    It was discovered that a double free in the RPCSEC_GSS part of the
    GSS library code might lead to arbitrary code execution.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.6-2sarge4.

For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed
in version 1.4.4-7etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your Kerberos packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hash: SHA1
MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2007-002
Original release: 2007-04-03
Last update: 2007-04-06
Topic: KDC, kadmind stack overflow in krb5\_klog\_syslog
Severity: CRITICAL
CVE: CVE-2007-0957
CERT: VU#704024
SUMMARY
=======
The library function krb5\_klog\_syslog() can write past the end of a
stack buffer. The Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind) as well as
the KDC, are vulnerable. Exploitation of this vulnerability is
probably simple.
This is a vulnerability in the the kadm5 library, which is used by the
KDC and kadmind, and possibly by some third-party applications. It is
not a bug in the MIT krb5 protocol libraries or in the Kerberos
protocol.
IMPACT
======
An authenticated user may be able to cause a host running kadmind to
execute arbitrary code.
An authenticated user may be able to cause a KDC host to execute
arbitrary code. Also, a user controlling a Kerberos realm sharing a
key with the target realm may be able to cause a KDC host to execute
arbitrary code.
Successful exploitation can compromise the Kerberos key database and
host security on the host running these programs. (kadmind and the
KDC typically run as root.) Unsuccessful exploitation attempts will
likely result in the affected program crashing.
Third-party applications which call krb5\_klog\_syslog() may also be
vulnerable.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
\* MIT krb5 releases through krb5-1.6
FIXES
=====
\* The upcoming krb5-1.6.1 release will contain a fix for this
vulnerability.
Prior to that release you may:
\* apply the patch
The patch is available at
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2007-002-patch.txt
A PGP-signed patch is available at
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2007-002-patch.txt.asc
A patch against krb5-1.5.x is at
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2007-002-patch15.txt
A PGP-signed patch against krb5-1.5.x is available at
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2007-002-patch15.txt.asc
Systems which definitely provide vsnprintf() may not need the entire
patch; see "DETAILS".
Please note that releases prior to krb5-1.5 will require additional
changes to the configure script src/lib/kadm5/configure in order to
correctly detect the presence of vsnprintf(). krb5-1.5 and later
releases already check for vsnprintf() in the top-level configure
script, and do not have a separate src/lib/kadm5/configure script.

CVE: CVE-2007-0957

CERT: VU#704024
http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/704024
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============
We thank iDefense Labs for notifying us of this vulnerability.
iDefense credits an anonymous discoverer.
DETAILS
=======
krb5\_klog\_syslog() uses vsprintf() to format text into a fixed-length
stack buffer. Format specifiers such as "%s" used in calls to
krb5\_klog\_syslog() may allow formatting of strings of sufficient
length to overwrite memory past the end of the stack buffer.
Certain strings received from the client by the kadmin daemon are not
truncated prior to logging. Among these strings is the target
principal for the kadmin operation.
The KDC truncates most client-originated strings prior to logging.
One sort of string which is not truncated is a transited-realms
string. A malicious KDC sharing a key with the target realm may issue
tickets with specially-crafted transited-realms strings to exploit
this vulnerability. There are other places where an authenticated
user may cause the KDC to log a string which triggers the
vulnerability.
On a system where vsnprintf() is confirmed to be available, the
patches to files other than src/lib/kadm5/logger.c may not be
necessary to prevent a buffer overflow; these patches are still useful
to prevent malicious users from causing vsnprintf() to obliterate
useful log information by means of truncation.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## MIT Kerberos 5 administration daemon stack overflow in krb5\_klog\_syslog()

#### Vulnerability Note VU#704024

Original Release Date: 2007-04-03 | Last Revised: 2007-05-30

---

### Overview

The Kerberos administration daemon contains a buffer overflow that may allow a remote, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

### Description

| A vulnerability exists in the way the krb5\_klog\_syslog() function used by the Kerberos administration daemon handles specially crafted strings. This vulnerability may cause a buffer overflow that could allow a remote, authenticated user to execute arbitrary code. According to MIT krb5 Security Advisory [MITKRB5-SA-2007-002](http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2007-002-syslog.txt):  *krb5\_klog\_syslog() uses vsprintf() to format text into a fixed-length stack buffer. Format specifiers such as "%s" used in calls to krb5\_klog\_syslog() may allow formatting of strings of sufficient length to overwrite memory past the end of the stack buffer**.**Certain strings received from the client by the kadmin daemon are not truncated prior to logging. Among these strings is the target principal for the kadmin operation.The KDC truncates most client-originated strings prior to logging. One sort of string which is not truncated is a transited-realms string. A malicious KDC sharing a key with the target realm may issue tickets with specially-crafted transited-realms strings to exploit this vulnerability. There are other places where an authenticated user may cause the KDC to log a string which triggers the vulnerability.*Note that this issue affects all releases of MIT krb5 up to and including krb5-1.6. Other server applications that call the krb5\_klog\_syslog()function provided with MIT krb5 may also be affected. This vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted Kerberos message to a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, authenticated user may be able to execute arbitrary code on an affected system or cause the affected program to crash, resulting in a denial of service. Secondary impacts of code execution include complete compromise of the Kerberos key database. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**A patch can be obtained from MIT krb5 Security Advisory [MITKRB5-SA-2007-002](http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2007-002-syslog.txt). MIT also states that this will be addressed in the upcoming krb5-1.6.1 release. |

# MIT Kerberos 5: Arbitrary remote code execution — GLSA **200704-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in MIT Kerberos 5 could potentially result in
unauthenticated remote root code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-crypt/mit-krb5** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.2-r1** |

### Background

MIT Kerberos 5 is a suite of applications that implement the Kerberos
network protocol.

### Description

The Kerberos telnet daemon fails to properly handle usernames allowing
unauthorized access to any account (CVE-2007-0956). The Kerberos
administration daemon, the KDC and possibly other applications using
the MIT Kerberos libraries are vulnerable to the following issues. The
krb5\_klog\_syslog function from the kadm5 library fails to properly
validate input leading to a stack overflow (CVE-2007-0957). The GSS-API
library is vulnerable to a double-free attack (CVE-2007-1216).

### Impact

By exploiting the telnet vulnerability a remote attacker may obtain
access with root privileges. The remaining vulnerabilities may allow an
authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root
privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MIT Kerberos 5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.5.2-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
