  "CVE-2007-0957": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow in the logging code of the KDC and the administration daemon might lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "root_cause": "The library function krb5_klog_syslog() uses vsprintf() to format text into a fixed-length stack buffer. Format specifiers such as \"%s\" used in calls to krb5_klog_syslog() may allow formatting of strings of sufficient length to overwrite memory past the end of the stack buffer.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the krb5_klog_syslog() function."
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user may be able to cause a host running kadmind or KDC to execute arbitrary code, potentially compromising the Kerberos key database and host security. Unsuccessful exploitation may result in a crash of the affected program.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted strings in client requests to the kadmin daemon.",
      "Specially crafted transited-realms strings in Kerberos tickets from a malicious KDC sharing a key with the target realm."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An authenticated user or a malicious KDC sharing a key with the target realm."
