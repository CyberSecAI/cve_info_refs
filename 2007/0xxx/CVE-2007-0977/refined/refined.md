The provided content is related to CVE-2007-0977.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists because Lotus Domino R5 and R6 Webmail, when configured to "Generate HTML for all fields", includes sensitive data from the names.nsf database in hidden form fields within the HTML source code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information disclosure: Sensitive data, including password hashes, are exposed in the HTML source code.
- Lack of proper access control:  The application fails to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data via HTML source.
- Predictable location of sensitive data: Hidden form fields are predictably placed and easily accessed in HTML.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can extract sensitive information by reading the HTML source, including:
  - Password hashes (`HTTPPassword` field)
  - Password change dates (`HTTPPasswordChangeDate` field)
  - Client platform (`ClntPltfrm` field)
  - Client machine name (`ClntMachine` field)
  - Client Lotus Domino release (`ClntBld` field)
- This information could be used for unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attackers can access the vulnerable webmail interface and retrieve the HTML source of pages containing hidden form fields.
- Specifically, the exploit targets the `$defaultview` view within the `names.nsf` database.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to access the webmail interface of a vulnerable Lotus Domino server remotely.
- No authentication is required to extract the information described in the exploit code.
- The server must have the “Generate HTML for all fields” setting enabled.
