RELATED: CVE-2007-0337

The provided content contains an exploit for a Local File Inclusion vulnerability in KGB 1.9, which is associated with CVE-2007-0337.

Vulnerability details:
- Vulnerability: Local File Inclusion (LFI)
- Affected component: `sesskglogadmin.php`
- Attack vector: By manipulating the `skinnn` parameter in `kgbmod/sesskglogadmin.php`, an attacker can include arbitrary files from the server. The `%00` is used for null byte injection, likely to bypass file extension checks.
- Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Root cause: Unsanitized input in the `skinnn` parameter allows inclusion of arbitrary files.
- Exploitation:
  1. Inject malicious code into a comment (e.g., `kg/wpisy.txt`).
  2. Call `sesskglogadmin.php` with `sesloga=1` and `skinnn=../../kg/wpisy.txt%00`.
  3. The injected PHP code gets executed due to the LFI.
  4. An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary PHP code by crafting a specific HTTP request with a `HAURU` header.
- Required conditions:
  - `register_globals = On` and `magic_quotes_gpc = off`
- Example exploit URL: `kgbmod/sesskglogadmin.php?sesloga=1&skinnn=../../kg/wpisy.txt%00`
