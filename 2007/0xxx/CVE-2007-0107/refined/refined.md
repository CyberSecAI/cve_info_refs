Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-0107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability arises from WordPress not properly sanitizing trackback entries with alternate character sets before including them in SQL queries.
*   **Information Disclosure:** WordPress reveals different error messages on `wp-login.php` based on whether a username exists, facilitating user enumeration.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** WordPress fails to sanitize recent file information in `/wp-admin/templates.php` before sending it to the browser, leading to potential XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization of user input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Revealing user existence through differing error messages.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Inadequate sanitization of file information before displaying it to users, allowing execution of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can manipulate database queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Allows attackers to identify valid usernames, making brute-force attacks easier.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Enables attackers to execute arbitrary HTML or JavaScript in the browsers of users viewing `/wp-admin/templates.php`, potentially leading to account hijacking or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** By crafting trackbacks with specific alternate character sets to inject SQL code when decoded by the WordPress application.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Through login attempts to `wp-login.php`, observing the different error messages to enumerate existing user accounts.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By manipulating file information in `/wp-admin/templates.php` with malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can remotely exploit the SQL injection vulnerability by crafting malicious trackbacks.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers need the ability to attempt login requests to the `wp-login.php` page.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The attacker must be authenticated to view the administrative section of the WordPress instance to exploit the XSS vulnerability in `/wp-admin/templates.php`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The security issue was responsibly reported by Stefan Esser.
*   WordPress version 2.0.6 includes fixes for these vulnerabilities.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 200701-10 also covers these vulnerabilities, referencing CVE-2007-0107 and the related CVEs.
