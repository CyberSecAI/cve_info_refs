  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The key serial number collision avoidance code was flawed, leading to potential reuse of key serial numbers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect implementation of random number generation for key serial numbers.",
      "Lack of proper collision detection and handling for key serial numbers."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could create many key requests, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation by creating multiple key requests."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local access to the system."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "vulnerability_details": "The vulnerability arose because random numbers were being used for key serial numbers which increased the likelihood of collisions. Previously, with an incrementing counter, a collision would be very unlikely. The issue leads to a spinlock CPU recursion which can cause a denial of service.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Linux kernel key management code"
