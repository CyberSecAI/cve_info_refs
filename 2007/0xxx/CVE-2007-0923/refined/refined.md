Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of input validation in the "Portal Search" product by Radical Technologies. Specifically, the application does not sanitize user-supplied input before using it in the search functionality and when displaying search results.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where malicious JavaScript code can be injected through the search query parameters. This is demonstrated with the provided example: `http://target/buscador/buscador.htm?%3CIFRAME%20SRC=%22javascript:alert('XSS');%22%3E%3C/IFRAME%3E`. This injection of an iframe with javascript:alert demonstrates XSS.
- **URL Redirection:** The application is vulnerable to URL redirection attacks. An attacker can craft a URL that redirects users to an arbitrary malicious site when clicked from the search results context. This is demonstrated with the example: `http://target/?http://www.hackersite.com`
- **Information Disclosure (Business Logic):** The description mentions the possibility of revealing business logic by searching for specific characters, which suggests that error messages or search results might expose internal workings of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS:** Exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser. This can be used to steal cookies, session tokens, credentials, redirect users to malicious pages, or deface the website.
- **URL Redirection:** Attackers can redirect users to phishing sites or other malicious websites, making it easier to steal credentials or install malware.
- **Business Logic Exposure:** Attackers may gain insights into the application's logic and data structures, which could be used to facilitate further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack vectors are primarily through crafted HTTP GET requests, where malicious code is embedded within the search query parameters. Specifically, parameters to `buscador.htm`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the web application.
- **No Special Privileges:** No specific privileges or authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of URL parameters:** The attacker needs to know the URL parameters used by the search functionality.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs containing Javascript code or URLs that redirect the victim to a malicious site.
