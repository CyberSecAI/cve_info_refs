      "details": "A local root vulnerability exists in the `expand_stack()` function. A remote vulnerability is also mentioned but is not detailed. The vulnerability is related to systems with the SEGMEXEC feature enabled (i386 architecture only). It involves the creation of an executable stack which triggers a vma mirroring bug.",
       "impact": "Local privilege escalation to root.",
       "attack_vector": "Local",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Vulnerability in `expand_stack()` due to improper handling of executable stack creation with SEGMEXEC.",

      "source": "grsecurity.net_32200d06_20250125_114606.html",
      "details": "The expand_stack() vulnerability is mentioned in the context of updated patches. The vulnerability is triggered when SEGMEXEC is enabled on i386, and the creation of an executable stack triggers a vma mirroring bug. It is noted that reliable privilege escalation may be difficult, especially with KERNEXEC/UDEREF enabled. System-wide MPROTECT could prevent the trigger by not allowing executable stacks.",
       "impact": "Potential privilege escalation or denial of service.",
       "attack_vector": "Local",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of executable stacks when SEGMEXEC is enabled.",
         "VMA mirroring bug that leads to exploitation."
       ],
