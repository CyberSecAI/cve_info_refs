Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0765:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw present in the `c_id` parameter within the `news.php` script of the dB Masters' Curium CMS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `c_id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This is a Blind SQL Injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and password hashes.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The exploit documentation suggests that after obtaining valid credentials, an attacker could potentially register on the site, manipulate cookies and gain administrative privileges, then upload files with arbitrary extensions through the upload section.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** The ability to upload arbitrary files could lead to further compromise of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `news.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs some familiarity with SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious queries.
- **No Authentication:** The exploit can be performed without prior authentication.

**Technical Details from Exploit:**
- The vulnerability is triggered using the following URL: `http://[target]/[path]//news.php?id=-1&c_id=[SQL]`
- An example SQL injection payload is provided: `//news.php?id=-1&s_id=-1%20union%20select%200,1,concat(username,char(32),password),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0%20from%20cm_users/*` This payload leverages a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract usernames and passwords from the `cm_users` table.

**Additional information:**
- The exploit is described as a "Remote Blind SQL Injection Vulnerability".
- The exploit was discovered in February 2007 by "ajann".
- The affected software is "dB Masters' Curium CMS <= 1.03".
- The Exploit-DB entry notes that after getting username and password hashes, an attacker can register and obtain admin privileges through cookie manipulation, and upload files through upload section.
