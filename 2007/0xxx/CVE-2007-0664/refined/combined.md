How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

=======================================================================

Vendor description:
-------------------
"TightGate-Pro is a ReCoB system. ReCoBS stands for Remote-Controlled Browser
System, literally translated 'remote-controlled web browser'. TightGate-Pro
physically separates the web browser execution environment from the workstation.
The system thus shields the internal network from the Internet and reliably
and preventively prevents attacks via the web browser. TightGate-Pro is the
strongest dedicated ReCoBS, because only physical outsourcing on a hardened
system permanently withstands attacks. Local virtualisations, sandboxing
systems or micro-virtualisations do not offer effective protection.
TightGate-Pro is used in public authorities, financial institutions, industrial
companies and critical infrastructures – in short, everywhere where “safe
surfing on the Internet” is indispensable at the workplace and internal
infrastructures must be reliably protected. TightGate-Pro is BSI-certified
according to EAL3+."

Source: <https://www.m-privacy.de/en/tightgate-pro-safe-surfing/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product
conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further
security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Code Execution
Execution of single commands and scripts is possible with the privileges of
the current user. Code execution is possible with any file type on the
server and no specific permissions need to be set for the utilized file.

Vendor response (translated):
"It is intended behavior to execute arbitrary bash scripts. It is not possible
to execute arbitrary programs and libraries. There is no privilege escalation
possible with this vulnerability."

We can confirm that it was not possible to escalate privileges during our test.

2) Access to all Desktops (CVE-2023-47250)
Multiple users are connecting to the same TightGate-Pro server, resulting in
one instance of the X11 window system. Due to insecure permissions of the
X11 sockets it is possible for any user to open arbitrary windows on the
desktop of other users for phishing attacks or installing a keylogger
directly.

Vendor response (translated):
"We acknowledge this issue as a important vulnerability. A fix with full
RSBAC-Jail-Separation and changed Linux-Filesystem permissions is currently
available in the "Prestable" packages:
- mprivacy-tools_2.0.406g
- tightgatevnc_4.1.2~1
- rsbac-policy-tgpro_2.0.159
These can be applied by the admin user "update". The updates will be provided
automatically as Hotfix around 2023-10-24."

3) File Transfer by Abusing the Print function (CVE-2023-47251)
TightGate-Pro allows printing PDF documents on the host system. Documents are
transferred to the host, printed and deleted afterwards. An attacker is able
to control the path of the transferred file and to prevent the automatic
deletion of the file.

Vendor response (translated):
"This is not a severe finding but we already fixed it. The fixes are available
in the packages:
- mprivacy-tools_2.0.406g
- tightgatevnc_4.1.2~1

Now the .spool directly is always scanned for malicious data and the VNC- client
does not transfer files which contain path symbols (e.g. ../)."

4) Outdated Update Server
Based on disclosed version numbers the update server is running outdated software
with known vulnerabilities. The criticality of this issue depends on the
exploitability of these issues.

Vendor response (translated):
"The old version of thttpd is already known. This is not seen as security-relevant.
The access to the updateserver requires a previous registration of a customer-
provided SSH key, which is only available to administrators on the TightGate-Pro
instance. thttpd is isolated on the updateserver and can only *read* files.

Even if an attacker can write malicious updatepackages, these are still secured
by a cryptographic signature and would not be installed on TightGate-Pro instances.
We will eventually replace thttpd with lighthttpd which is still supported."

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Code Execution
Code execution is possible using the context menu of any file in the VNC session
of TightGate-Pro. Selecting "Öffnen mit" (Open with) in the context menu of any
file and  selecting the "Benutzerdefinierte Befehlszeile" (custom commandline)
section of the menu allows to provide a custom shell command to be executed:

At this point there are two possible options:
In case the selected file is a bash script typing `/bin/bash` as custom command
will execute the script. For this PoC the following script has been used:

```
#!bin/bash
echo poc >> /home/user/testuser/Desktop/test/PoC2.txt
```

In case any other file is selected a complete command can be used as well.
A possible example is listed below:
`/bin/bash -c "echo poc >> /home/user/testuser/Desktop/test/PoC2.txt"`

According to vendor, arbitrary code execution is not possible as programs and
libraries won't be executed.

2) Access to all Desktops (CVE-2023-47250)
A normal user without special permissions has read and write access to all X11
sockets stored in the temp folder of the user TightGate-Pro, visible in the
following screenshot:

[advisory_desktop_access_x11_perms.png]

This allows any user for example to open dialogue boxes on the desktop of the
currently connected users as shown in the following screenshots. The command
used is listed below.

`/bin/bash -c 'for i in $(ls /home/tmpdir/tmp510/.X11-unix | cut -b 2-); do
DISPLAY=unix:"$i".0 zenity --password --username & done;'`

[advisory_desktop_access_gui_triggered.png]

As it can be seen in the following screenshot any input to the dialogue boxes
can be read by the attacker.

[advisory_desktop_access_result.png]

3) File Transfer by Abusing the Print function (CVE-2023-47251)
File transfers can be triggered for PDF files which are stored in the
`/home/user/.spool/<username>` directory. By setting a relative path as file
name, the file can be stored in any user directory on the host system.
In case the file name contains Unicode characters, deletion of the file is
not executed after transfer and closing of the print prompt. To store a file
on the user's desktop, the name `..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\Desktop\\Ỻeicar.pdf`
can be used. The transfer can then be triggered by sending the
signal `SIGUSR2` to the `Xtightgatevnc` process:

```
cp eicar.pdf '/home/user/.spool/<username>/..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\Desktop\\Ỻeicar.pdf'
pkill -u $USER --signal SIGUSR2 Xtightgatevnc
```

In addition, this file transfer does not check if any malicious files are
transferred to the host system. The following screenshot shows the warning of
a malware scanner after an eicar testfile was transferred. It is therefore
possible to circumvent the malware scanner of TightGate-Pro which only runs
if the intended way of transfer, namely the TightGate-Schleuse, is used.

4) Outdated Update Server
Access to the update server is possible with the ssh key stored at
`/etc/cu/id_ed25519` and ssh port forwarding. The ssh key is customized
for each customer. Root access is needed to retrieve the key.
The command used for the forwarding is listed below:

```
ssh -N -L 8000:localhost:85 tgpro13 () update m-privacy de -i id_ed25519 -v
```

Afterwards access is possible at `http:127.0.0.1:8000`.
The server headers return the version of the webserver:
`thttpd/2.25b 29dec2003`

[advisory_outdated_server.png]

This version has in sum four known vulnerabilities (high and medium) listed:
* CVE-2006-1078
* CVE-2006-1079
* CVE-2007-0664
* CVE-2009-4491

# thttpd: Unauthenticated remote file access — GLSA **200701-28**

The default configuration of the Gentoo thttpd package potentially allows
unauthenticated access to system files when used with newer versions of
baselayout.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/thttpd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.25b-r6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.25b-r6** |

### Background

thttpd is a webserver designed to be simple, small, and fast.

### Description

thttpd is vulnerable to an underlying change made to the
start-stop-daemon command in the current stable Gentoo baselayout
package (version 1.12.6). In the new version, the start-stop-daemon
command performs a "chdir /" command just before starting the thttpd
process. In the Gentoo default configuration, this causes thttpd to
start with the document root set to "/", the sytem root directory.

### Impact

When thttpd starts with the document root set to the system root
directory, all files on the system that are readable by the thttpd
process can be remotely accessed by unauthenticated users.

### Workaround

Alter the THTTPD\_OPTS variable in /etc/conf.d/thttpd to include the
"-d" option to specify the document root. Alternatively, modify the
THTTPD\_OPTS variable in /etc/conf.d/thttpd to specify a thttpd.conf
file using the "-C" option, and then configure the "dir=" directive in
that thttpd.conf file.

### Resolution

All thttpd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/thttpd-2.25b-r5"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Laurence Withers    2006-07-28 16:38:54 UTC  ``` The thttpd init script and config file fail to set the correct docroot for thttpd (thttpd's docroot is, unless explicitly given, taken to be the current working directory from where it is launched).  I have specified (e.g.) THTTPD_DOCROOT="/var/www/localhost" in /etc/conf.d/thttpd; the init script then does a chdir to this directory prior to running start-stop-daemon (and I verified this was the case with a suitably-placed "pwd").  If I run the server manually, i.e. "cd /var/www/localhost; /usr/sbin/thttpd -C /etc/conf.d/thttpd" then all works as expected, and it uses the cwd as the docroot. If, however, I use the init script (or cd manually and launch thttpd through start-stop-daemon) then the server fails to find its documents.  An strace session shows that the last thing start-stop-daemon does before executing thttpd is to change directory to / -- so this is clearly the cause of the problem.  A quick fix is to ignore the THTTPD_DOCROOT variable (as long as it's set to something that does exist) and to instead specify "dir=/var/www/localhost" in the thttpd config file (or use the equivalent commandline option). ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Laurence Withers    2006-07-28 16:40:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 92964](attachment.cgi?id=92964 "strace session") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=92964&action=edit "strace session")] strace session  On line 33, you can see a chdir("/"); on line 34, you can see start-stop-daemon execute thttpd. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Daniel Drake (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-09-06 07:17:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 96170](attachment.cgi?id=96170 "thttpd init.d patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=96170&action=edit "thttpd init.d patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=96170&action=diff "thttpd init.d patch")] thttpd init.d patch  ebuild should also be bumped ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Daniel Drake (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-09-06 07:33:05 UTC  ``` in portage ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Wolfram Schlich (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-01-25 07:21:50 UTC  ``` I just stumbled over this and have some news :)  This only seems to happen with newer baselayout versions (and thus, start-stop-daemon versions):  --chdir or dir= in config not necessary with:   =sys-apps/baselayout-1.11.14-r6  --chdir or dir= in config not necessary with:   =sys-apps/baselayout-1.12.6 ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Wolfram Schlich (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-01-25 07:25:00 UTC  ``` whoops!  (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=142047#c4)) > --chdir or dir= in config not necessary with: >   =sys-apps/baselayout-1.11.14-r6 >  > --chdir or dir= in config not necessary with: >   =sys-apps/baselayout-1.12.6  the second 'not' is misplaced :) so --chdir or dir= in config *are* necessary with newer baselayouts.  this issue just opened up a root (/) on one webserver I am taking care of! so, older versions of the thttpd package combined with newer versions of baselayout open up a f***ing big security hole! :-(  @security: please think about issuing a GLSA for older thttpd package versions. we must not leave the user alone here. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Vic Fryzel (shellsage) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-01-26 12:40:51 UTC  ``` Requesting GLSA... ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-02-10 18:59:04 UTC  ``` old GLSA 200701-28 ``` |  |

| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-12 19:01:52 UTC  ``` Hi!  Ran across some problems with the mplayer-0.60.ebuild  1. a symlink is merged from /usr/bin/gmplayer to /var/tmp/portage/mplayer-0.60/image//usr/bin/mplayer  At first, I thought this was due tosomething in the ebuild, but further investigation indicates that it is probably 'ln -s' somewhere in the Makefile.  2. sandbox violation, seems to occur when installing the fonts. I'll attach the sandbox log that blocks mkdir /usr/share/mplayer However, when merging without sandbox,  !!! /usr/share/mplayer/font -> /usr/share/mplayer/fonts/iso8559-1/arial-14/ !!! /usr/share/mplayer/font -> /usr/share/mplayer/fonts/iso8559-1/arial-14/  is seen during merging to the live filesystem indicating its related to the font install. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-12 19:02:29 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 50](attachment.cgi?id=50 "sandbox-mplayer-0.60-12413.log") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=50&action=edit "sandbox-mplayer-0.60-12413.log")] sandbox-mplayer-0.60-12413.log ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-13 20:44:35 UTC  ``` 1. Thanks, didnt see this.  2. Again, thanks.  Due to changes in the build system, the ebuild had to be    updated, but because I already had /usr/share/mplayer/fonts, it did not    try to recreate it, and I missed it.     The other problem with the symlinks is basically a portage feature/bug.    If the real /usr/share/mplayer/font exist, in sertain cases it does not    get updated with the new one if the new one is a symlink.     Unmerging the old release (or current) and remerging should fix this    problem.  You can even consider rm -rf /usr/share/mplayer before merging.  Added mplayer-0.60-r1 which should fix this problems.  ``` |  |
