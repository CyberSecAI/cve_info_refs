Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability arises from a change in the `start-stop-daemon` command within newer versions of the Gentoo `baselayout` package (specifically version 1.12.6 and later). This change introduces a `chdir /` command just before starting the `thttpd` process.
- The default configuration of the Gentoo `thttpd` package does not explicitly set the document root. Thus it uses the current working directory as the document root.
- As the `start-stop-daemon` executes `chdir /`, this leads `thttpd` to start with its document root set to the system's root directory (`/`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Document Root:** `thttpd` starts with the system's root directory (`/`) as its document root due to the `chdir /` command in `start-stop-daemon` and the lack of an explicit document root definition in the default configuration.
- **Unrestricted File Access:** With the document root set to `/`, all files on the system that are readable by the `thttpd` process become accessible via the webserver.
- **Default Configuration Issue:** The default configuration of the Gentoo `thttpd` package does not specify the document root, making it vulnerable to the `chdir /` behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized File Access:** Unauthenticated remote users can access any file on the system that is readable by the `thttpd` process. This includes sensitive configuration files, personal data, and system files.
- **Information Disclosure:** The ability to read arbitrary files can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Exposure of sensitive files and configurations could enable further attacks, such as privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network via HTTP requests.
- **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker can simply send an HTTP request to access any readable file from the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable `thttpd` instance.
- **No Credentials Required:** The attacker does not need any user credentials or prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**

- The Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 200701-28 was issued to address this vulnerability.
- The Gentoo bug tracker includes a discussion about the issue and its resolution (Bug 142047).
- A patch was provided which specifies the document root, preventing the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is classified as "low severity" but "exploitable remotely" in the Gentoo advisory.
- A workaround was to either set the `THTTPD_OPTS` variable with the `-d` option to specify the document root or use the `-C` option to specify a configuration file, using the "dir=" directive in that file.
