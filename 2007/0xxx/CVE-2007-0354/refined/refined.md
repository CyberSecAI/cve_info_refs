    "Details": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the 'id' parameter in the email.php script before using it in an SQL query.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including administrator passwords, by injecting malicious SQL code.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the email.php script, injecting SQL code via the 'id' parameter.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No prior authentication or specific user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker does not need to be local."

    "Details": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 'email.php' script in MGB versions up to 0.5.4.5 is vulnerable to SQL injection via the 'id' parameter.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "The attacker can extract sensitive information such as admin passwords from the database. Specifically the exploit retrieves the admin password hash and admin login link.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable 'email.php' script, with a malicious SQL query injected into the 'id' parameter.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request to the server, specifically to the email.php page, and therefore needs network access. No other privileges are required."
