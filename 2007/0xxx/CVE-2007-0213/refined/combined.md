## Vulnerability Details

#### Outlook Web Access Script Injection Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0220:

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Microsoft Exchange in the way that Outlook Web Access (OWA) handles script-based attachments. An attached script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take within the context of the OWA session.

#### Mitigating Factors for Outlook Web Access Script Injection Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0220:

* The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful an attacker must e-mail a specially crafted file to a user and convince the user to open the file within an authenticated OWA session.
* Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 is not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Outlook Web Access Script Injection Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0220:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Disable Outlook Web Access (OWA) on a computer running Exchange Server.**

  Disabling Outlook Web Access helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable Outlook Web Access, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft Exchange**, and then click **System Manager**.
  2. Expand **Servers,** expand **Server,** expand **Protocols,** and then expand **HTTP**.
  3. Right-click **Exchange Virtual Server**, and then click **Stop**.

  **Note** A red cross will appear over the Exchange Virtual Server icon, indicating it has been stopped. From now on, users will see a **The Page Cannot Be Displayed** error message when they try to access their e-mail through OWA.

  **Impact of workaround:** This workaround prevents users from accessing their mailboxes through Outlook Web Access (OWA), Outlook Mobile Access (OMA) and Exchange Server ActiveSync.
* **Block HTML Attachment as Level2 Type in Outlook Web Access (OWA).**

  Set Outlook Web Access to save HTML attachments locally before they are opened. This enables Internet Explorer to check for active content and warn the user before opening the attachment.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk.

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

#### FAQ for Outlook Web Access Script Injection Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0220:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A script injection vulnerability exists that could allow an attacker to run a script supplied by the attacker. If this script were run, it would run in the security context of the OWA user on the client system. The script could take any action on the user's computer that the Web site was authorized to take. These actions could include monitoring the userâs Web session and forwarding information to a third party, running other code on the user's system, and reading or writing cookies.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An incorrectly handled UTF character set label in Outlook Web Access could allow unauthorized scripts to run.

**What is Outlook Web Access?**

Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) is a service of Exchange Server. By using OWA, a server that is running Exchange Server can also function as a Web site that lets authorized users read and send e-mail, manage their calendar, and perform other e-mail functions over the Internet.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain access to the Outlook Web Access session in the security context of the exploited user. The attacker could then change, delete, forward e-mail, or perform other actions on behalf of the logged on user.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by e-mailing a specially-crafted file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file within an authenticated OWA session.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Users who are using Microsoft Exchange Outlook Web Access to read e-mail are primarily at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by changing the way that Outlook Web Access handles UTF encoded attachments.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Malformed iCal Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0039:

A denial of service vulnerability exists in Microsoft Exchange Server because of the way that it handles calendar content requests. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending an e-mail message with specially crafted iCal file to a Microsoft Exchange Server user account. An attacker successfully exploiting this vulnerability could cause the mail service to stop responding.

#### Mitigating Factors for Malformed iCal Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0039:

We have not identified any mitigations for this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Malformed iCal Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0039:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Require authentication for connections to a server that is running Microsoft Exchange Server for all client and message transport protocols**

  Requiring authentication for all connections made to the Exchange Server computer will help protect against anonymous attacks. This will not protect against an attack from a user who can successfully authenticate.

  **Impact of workaround:** Anonymous communication from clients through IMAP, POP3, HTTP, LDAP, SMTP, and NNTP will no longer be possible. Server to server anonymous communication through RPC, X.400, foreign gateway, and third-party connector protocols will also no longer be possible. In default configurations of Exchange Server, authenticated access is required for all protocols except SMTP. If all text/calendar MIME type message parts and the meeting.ics file are blocked, anonymous SMTP connections could still be accepted.
* **Block iCal on Microsoft Exchange Server to help protect against attempts to exploit this vulnerability through SMTP e-mail**

  Systems can be configured to block certain types of files from being received as e-mail attachments. Meeting requests, typically used in Outlook, contain a file attachment that stores the meeting information. This file attachment is usually named meeting.ics. Blocking this file, and blocking the calendar MIME type, could help protect Exchange Servers and other affected programs from attempts to exploit this vulnerability if customers cannot install the available security update. To help protect an Exchange Server computer from attacks through SMTP, block the .ics files and all text/calendar MIME type content before it reaches the Exchange Server computer.

  **Note** Exchange supports other messaging protocols, such as X.400, that these workarounds do not protect. We recommend that administrators require authentication on all other client and message transport protocols to help prevent attacks using these protocols.

  **Note** Filtering only for attachments that have the file name meeting.ics may not be sufficient to help protect your system. A specially crafted file attachment could be given another file name that could then be processed by the Exchange Server computer. To help protect against specially crafted e-mail messages, block all text/calendar MIME type content.

  There are many ways to block the meeting.ics file and other calendar content. Here are some suggestions:

  + You can use ISA Server 2000 SMTP Message Screener to block all file attachments or to block only the meeting.ics file. Blocking all file attachments provides the most protection for this issue if you use ISA Server 2000 because ISA Server 2000 does not support blocking content based on MIME content types. For more information, see Microsoft [Knowledge Base Article 315132](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/315132).
  + You can use ISA Server 2000 SMTP Filter to block all file attachments or to block only the meeting.ics file. Blocking all file attachments provides the most protection for this issue if you use ISA Server 2000 because ISA Server 2000 does not support blocking content based on MIME content types. For more information, see Microsoft [Knowledge Base Article 320703](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/320703).
  + You can use ISA Server 2004 SMTP Filter and Message Screener block all file attachments or just the meeting.ics file. Blocking all file attachments provides the most protection for this issue if you use ISA Server 2004 because ISA Server 2004 does not support blocking content based on MIME content types. For more information, see Microsoft [Knowledge Base Article 888709](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/888709).
  + You can use third-party e-mail filters to block all text/calendar MIME type content before it is sent to the Exchange Server computer or to a vulnerable application.

  **Impact of workaround:** If calendar attachments are blocked, meeting requests will not be received correctly. In some cases, users could receive blank e-mail messages instead of the original meeting request. In other cases, users may not receive meeting requests at all. Perform this workaround only if you cannot install the available security update or if a security update is not publicly available for your configuration.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

Microsoft disclaims all warranties, either express or implied, including the warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. In no event shall Microsoft Corporation or its suppliers be liable for any damages whatsoever including direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, loss of business profits or special damages, even if Microsoft Corporation or its suppliers have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages so the foregoing limitation may not apply.

**Revisions:**

* V1.0 (May 8, 2007): Bulletin published.
* V1.1 (May 26, 2009): Added an entry in the section, **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update**, to announce a detection change. The detection no longer offers the MS06-019 and MS06-029 updates, but instead will only offer MS07-026. There were no changes to the binaries. Customers who have already successfully installed the MS07-026 update do not need to reinstall.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft Exchange Server fails to properly decode MIME email messages

#### Vulnerability Note VU#343145

Original Release Date: 2007-05-08 | Last Revised: 2007-05-09

---

### Overview

Microsoft Exchange Server contains a remote code execution vulnerability that could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code and gain complete control of the vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft Exchange Server fails to properly process MIME messages. When an email message containing base64 encoded content is opened, Microsoft Exchange Server does not properly decode the base64 content. An attacker could send a specially crafted email that, when opened, could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code. The attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. |
