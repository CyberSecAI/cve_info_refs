**Related to CVE-2007-0760**

**Vulnerability:** Referer Spoofing

**Root Cause:** The EQdkp application versions <= 1.3.1 improperly validates the referring URL when accessing the MySQL backup/restore functionality.

**Attack Vector:** By spoofing the HTTP Referer header, an attacker can bypass the authentication check and gain access to the backup functionality.

**Impact:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The attacker can download SQL database backups, potentially containing usernames, email addresses, and MD5 hashed passwords. Other databases such as PHPBB databases are also potentially accessible.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**
    *   The attacker can modify the administrator's password hash in the downloaded `EQDKP_users.sql` file, restore the modified database, and log in as the administrator.
    *   The attacker can modify the administrator's email address in the `EQDKP_users.sql` file, request a password reset, and gain access to the administrator account.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify the SQL data.

**Attacker Capabilities:**

*   Ability to spoof the Referer header in HTTP requests using tools like `quickspoof`.
*   Basic knowledge of web application vulnerabilities and database manipulation.
*   Access to the EQdkp application URL.
