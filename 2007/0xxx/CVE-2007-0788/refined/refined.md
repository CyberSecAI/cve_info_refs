Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0788:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the JavaScript code responsible for regenerating "sortable tables" within MediaWiki.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HTML Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an HTML injection flaw. This occurs because the JavaScript code doesn't adequately sanitize user-supplied input before incorporating it into the HTML structure of the sortable tables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code into pages containing sortable tables. This could lead to:
    - **Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that could be executed in the browsers of users viewing the affected pages.
    - **Defacement:** An attacker could alter the visual appearance of the page, potentially inserting malicious or misleading content.
    - **Information theft:** If the injected script is malicious, it could potentially steal user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through user-supplied input that is used to generate sortable tables. This could be achieved by:
  - Modifying data used in sortable table generation (e.g., through a specially crafted wiki page edit).
  - Other forms of input that is used by the vulnerable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to inject malicious input that is processed by the vulnerable JavaScript code.
-  This means the attacker needs to be a user that has the ability to create/modify pages where sortable tables are used.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in the 1.9 branch of MediaWiki and was fixed in version 1.9.2.
*   The provided content from lists.wikimedia.org explicitly mentions the HTML injection vulnerability related to the sortable tables JavaScript code.
*   The content from secunia.com and svn.wikimedia.org do not provide details specific to CVE-2007-0788. The content from vupen.com is an under construction page.
