{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An unsanitized value is passed to the alloca() function when parsing certain CHM files with tables and objects stored in pages. This results in a shift of the stack pointer to arbitrary memory locations.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory corruption vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution with the permissions of the user viewing the file.",
  "Attack vectors": "Enticing a user to open a specially crafted CHM file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create a malicious CHM file and have a user open it."
