{
  "CVE-2007-0242": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper handling of truncated UTF-8 strings by the Qt library.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "The Qt library's UTF-8 decoder may fail to reject overlong sequences."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could bypass input sanitization, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or directory traversal.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious strings, especially in web applications (like Konqueror).",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious UTF-8 sequence. They need a position where they can trick a user into visiting a malicious website (for XSS), or to provide a malformed input to a vulnerable application."
  }
