Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-0053

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user input in the `iPro` parameter of the `detail.asp` page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is a SQL Injection vulnerability. The `iPro` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's database. This can lead to:
*   **Data Breaches:** Extraction of sensitive data, such as usernames, passwords, and other user details.
*   **Data Modification:**  Alteration or deletion of data within the database.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Disrupting the normal operation of the application.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Potentially gaining administrative access to the application or underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `detail.asp` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No special access or privileges are required. The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
