This flaw pre-dates the existing upstream git repo, so I've been unable to find the specific patch that addressed the flaw.  However, based on other "possible heap overflows" from that era, their CVSS looks to be appropriate.  It's possible this flaw is the same one from 2005 noted here: <https://seclists.org/vulnwatch/2005/q4/33>   ``` |  |
