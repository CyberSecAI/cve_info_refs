Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of the `INCLUDE_DIR` variable used in `require_once` statements within the Article System 0.1 application. Specifically, the application directly incorporates the value of the `INCLUDE_DIR` GET parameter into the file path used in `require_once` statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application is vulnerable to RFI due to the unsanitized use of the `INCLUDE_DIR` variable in `require_once` function calls. This allows an attacker to include a file from a remote location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can include arbitrary remote files into the application's execution context. This allows them to execute malicious code on the server, potentially leading to:
    - Complete compromise of the application
    - Data theft
    - Server takeover
    - Defacement
    - Denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable files (`forms.php`, `issue_edit.php`, `client.php`, and `classes.php` in the `/include/` directory). The attacker crafts a URL that includes a malicious URL as the value of the `INCLUDE_DIR` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- The attacker needs to have access to a server hosting a malicious file that can be included by the target application.

**Technical Details:**

- Vulnerable code snippet: `require_once ("$INCLUDE_DIR/classes/class.form_item.php");`
- Example PoC URLs:
    - `http://[target]/[script_path]/include/forms.php?INCLUDE_DIR=shell.txt?`
    - `http://[target]/[script_path]/include/issue_edit.php?INCLUDE_DIR=shell.txt?`
    - `http://[target]/[script_path]/include/client.php?INCLUDE_DIR=shell.txt?`
    - `http://[target]/[script_path]/include/classes.php?INCLUDE_DIR=shell.txt?`
