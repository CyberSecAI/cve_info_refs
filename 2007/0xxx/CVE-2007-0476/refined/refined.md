Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-0476:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `gencert.sh` script, distributed with the Gentoo ebuild for OpenLDAP, uses `/tmp` insecurely during the installation process. Specifically, it does not properly check for the existence of a directory in `/tmp` before creating files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure usage of `/tmp`: The script does not verify whether a directory already exists in `/tmp` with the same name as what it intends to create.
- Directory traversal: By creating a symbolic link in `/tmp`, an attacker can redirect the file creation process to an arbitrary location in the file system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file overwrite: A local attacker can overwrite system files by creating a symbolic link in `/tmp` that points to the desired destination.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to have local access to the system where OpenLDAP is being installed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to create a symbolic link in `/tmp` prior to the OpenLDAP installation/update by a privileged user.

**Additional notes:**
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200701-19) provides additional details not present in the CVE description, such as the specific vulnerable script and the method of exploitation.
- The Gentoo bug report #159508 is related to this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is considered low severity but exploitable locally.
- The vulnerability is fixed in openldap versions >= 2.1.30-r10, >= 2.2.28-r7 and >= 2.3.30-r2
