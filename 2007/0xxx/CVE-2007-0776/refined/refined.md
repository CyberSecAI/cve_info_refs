  "CVE-2007-0776": {
    "description": "The Mozilla SVG viewer contains an integer overflow vulnerability. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, or create a denial-of-service condition.",
    "root_cause": "The Mozilla SVG viewer fails to properly validate size parameters supplied to a memory allocation routine, leading to an integer overflow. This results in allocation of an undersized buffer, and a heap-based buffer overflow when data is copied into it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition.",
    "attack_vector": "By convincing a user to visit a website hosting a specially crafted SVG file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker."
