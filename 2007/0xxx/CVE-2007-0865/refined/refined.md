Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `comments.php` file of LushiNews version 1.01. This is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `id` parameter in the `comments.php` file, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:**  An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and email addresses of members.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** In some cases, SQL injection can be used to gain further access to the server, though this exploit specifically targets data extraction.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to `comments.php` with a crafted `id` parameter containing malicious SQL. The exploit code shows an example of a crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable LushiNews application.
*   **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft a malicious SQL query. The exploit code demonstrates a valid payload.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `id` parameter in `comments.php` is vulnerable.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server.

**Additional Details from Exploit Code:**

*   The provided exploit code is an ASP file (`exploit2.asp`) designed to automate the SQL injection process.
*   It takes the target URL and user ID as input.
*   It constructs a malicious SQL query using `UNION SELECT` to extract user data.
*   It uses `Microsoft.XMLHTTP` to send requests and retrieve data.
*   It also includes functionality to retrieve HTTP headers and perform a WHOIS lookup.
*   The exploit code includes rudimentary input validation to check for `union`, `http://` and numeric characters, which may prevent basic usage errors but not SQL injection
*   The code extracts username, password, and email from the database.
*   It performs regular expression matching on the returned data to extract desired information
*   The exploit code is designed to be used via a web browser, presenting a form that the user interacts with to execute the attack.

The provided exploit code includes an automated process for exploiting this SQLi.
