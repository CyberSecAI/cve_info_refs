{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `uri_lookup` macro in `ne_uri.c` uses an incorrect type cast when indexing the `uri_chars` array. It casts the character to `unsigned` (which is equivalent to `unsigned int`), but should cast to `unsigned char`. When a non-ASCII character (value > 128) is encountered, the `unsigned` cast results in a large positive integer which, when used as an index, leads to an out-of-bounds access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect type casting",
      "Out-of-bounds array access"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (crash) due to a segmentation fault.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "Parsing of a URI containing non-ASCII characters."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to supply a URI containing non-ASCII characters to an application that uses the vulnerable libneon26 library. This could be achieved through various means, such as embedding a malicious link in a document or on a website.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is more likely to manifest on 64-bit systems due to the size difference between `char` and `int`. On 32-bit systems, the erroneous cast might not lead to an out-of-bounds access."
