      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_ed169ba5_20250125_081503.html",
      "content": "The vulnerability exists in IP phones using the PA168 chipset, specifically in how they handle authenticated sessions. When a superuser logs into the admin web console, the session is considered active. Attackers can then perform administrative tasks by sending well-formed requests to the web server, even from a different IP address, as long as the superuser session is active. No authentication tokens or passwords are required within the HTTP requests after the initial superuser login. An exploit script was created to repeatedly send forged superuser requests until a session is active, then retrieve and email sensitive information like the superuser password, user password, SIP gateway details, SIP username, and SIP PIN. The vulnerability can be tested by logging into the admin console with a superuser account from one computer, and then sending a crafted request from a different computer to access the administrative settings page without needing credentials.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: Weak session management.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Lack of proper session management, absence of authentication tokens or password checks for subsequent requests after superuser login.\n\nImpact of exploitation: Remote attackers can gain full administrative access to the IP phone, retrieve sensitive credentials (including SIP account details, and admin/user passwords), and potentially eavesdrop on or manipulate VoIP calls. Attackers can also make unauthorized configuration changes to the device.\n\nAttack vectors: Remote, over the network using HTTP requests to the IP phone's web server. \n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable IP phone over the network, and have knowledge of the vulnerable devices and the HTTP paths required. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the superuser once the superuser has logged in, and does not need credentials beyond a well formed request after a superuser has logged in."
