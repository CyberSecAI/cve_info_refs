FreeBSD-SA-07:02.bind Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities in named(8)
Category: contrib
Module: bind
Announced: 2007-02-09
Affects: FreeBSD 5.3 and later.
Corrected: 2007-02-07 00:42:09 UTC (RELENG\_6, 6.2-STABLE)
2007-02-09 20:24:15 UTC (RELENG\_6\_2, 6.2-RELEASE-p1)
2007-02-09 20:23:29 UTC (RELENG\_6\_1, 6.1-RELEASE-p13)
2007-02-07 00:46:35 UTC (RELENG\_5, 5.5-STABLE)
2007-02-09 20:22:44 UTC (RELENG\_5\_5, 5.5-RELEASE-p11)
CVE Name: CVE-2007-0493, CVE-2007-0494
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
BIND 9 is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols.
The named(8) daemon is an Internet domain name server. DNS Security
Extensions (DNSSEC) are additional protocol options that add
authentication and integrity to the DNS protocols.
II. Problem Description
A type \* (ANY) query response containing multiple RRsets can trigger an
assertion failure.
Certain recursive queries can cause the nameserver to crash by using memory
which has already been freed.
III. Impact
A remote attacker sending a type \* (ANY) query to an authoritative DNS
server for a DNSSEC signed zone can cause the named(8) daemon to exit,
resulting in a Denial of Service.
A remote attacker sending recursive queries can cause the nameserver to
crash, resulting in a Denial of Service.
IV. Workaround
There is no workaround available, but systems which are not authoritative
servers for DNSSEC signed zones are not affected by the first issue; and
systems which do not permit untrusted users to perform recursive DNS
resolution are not affected by the second issue. Note that the default
configuration for named(8) in FreeBSD allows local access only (which on
many systems is equivalent to refusing access to untrusted users).
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 5-STABLE, or 6-STABLE, or to the
RELENG\_6\_2, RELENG\_6\_1, or RELENG\_5\_5 security branch dated after the
correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 5.5, 6.1,
and 6.2 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 5.5, FreeBSD 6.1]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-07:02/bind61.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-07:02/bind61.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 6.2]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-07:02/bind62.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-07:02/bind62.patch.asc
b) Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/lib/bind
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
# cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/named
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
c) Restart the named application:
# /etc/rc.d/named restart
VI. Correction details

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 1254-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                         Moritz Muehlenhoff
January 27th, 2007                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : bind9
Vulnerability  : insufficient input sanitising
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-0494

It was discovered that the Bind name server daemon is vulnerable to denial
of service by triggering an assertion through a crafted DNS query. This
only affects installations which use the DNSSEC extentions.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 9.2.4-1sarge2.

For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) this problem will be fixed
soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 9.3.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

			BIND 9: DNSSEC Validation
                             10 January 2007

Versions affected:

	BIND 9.0.x (all versions of BIND 9.0)	(at end-of-life)
	BIND 9.1.x (all versions of BIND 9.1)	(at end-of-life)
	BIND 9.2.0, 9.2.1, 9.2.2, 9.2.3, 9.2.4, 9.2.5, 9.2.6, 9.2.7
	BIND 9.3.0, 9.3.1, 9.3.2, 9.3.3
        BIND 9.4.0a1, 9.4.0a2, 9.4.0a3, 9.4.0a4, 9.4.0a5, 9.4.0a6, 9.4.0b1
	     9.4.0b2, 9.4.0b3, 9.4.0b4, 9.4.0rc1
	BIND 9.5.0a1 (Bind Forum only)

Severity: Low
Exploitable: Remotely

Description:

	When validating responses to type * (ANY) queries that return
	multiple RRsets in the answer section it is possible to trigger
	assertions checks.

	To be vulnerable you need to have enabled dnssec validation in
	named.conf by specifying trusted-keys.

Workaround:

	Disable / restrict recursion (to limit exposure).
	Disable DNSSEC validation (remove all trusted-keys from named.conf).

Fix:

	Upgrade to BIND 9.2.8, BIND 9.3.4 or BIND 9.4.0rc2.
	Additionally this will be fixed in the upcoming BIND 9.5.0a2.

Note:

	It is recommended that anyone using DNSSEC upgrade to BIND 9.3
	as the DNSSEC implementation in BIND 9.2 has been obsoleted.

## Synopsis

Moderate: bind security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0044)

## Topic

Updated bind packages that fix a security issue and a bug are now available.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

ISC BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an implementation of the DNS
(Domain Name System) protocols.

A flaw was found in the way BIND processed certain DNS query responses. On
servers that had enabled DNSSEC validation, this could allow an remote
attacker to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2007-0494)

For users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, the previous BIND update caused an
incompatible change to the default configuration that resulted in rndc not
sharing the key with the named daemon. This update corrects this bug and
restores the behavior prior to that update.

Updating the bind package in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 could result in
nonfunctional configuration in case the bind-libs package was not updated.
This update corrects this bug by adding the correct dependency on bind-libs.

Users of BIND are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

NetBSD Security Advisory 2007-003
=================================
Topic: BIND multiple denial of service vulnerabilities
Version: NetBSD-current: source prior to January 27, 2007
NetBSD 4.0\_BETA2: affected
NetBSD 3.1: affected
NetBSD 3.0.\*: affected
NetBSD 3.0: affected
NetBSD 2.1: not affected
NetBSD 2.0.\*: not affected
NetBSD 2.0: not affected
pkgsrc: bind-9.3.2 and earlier
Severity: Denial of service
Fixed: NetBSD-current: January 27, 2007
NetBSD-4 branch: March 04, 2007
NetBSD-3-1 branch: March 04, 2007
NetBSD-3-0 branch: March 04, 2007
NetBSD-3 branch: March 04, 2007
pkgsrc: bind-9.3.4 corrects the issue
Abstract
========
Two denial of service vulnerabilities have been reported in bind which
can cause the name server daemon to crash. The vulnerabilities relate
to the processing of type \* (ANY) queries and recursive queries.
The ANY query processing issue has been assigned CVE reference CVE-2007-0493.
The recursive query issue has been assigned CVE reference CVE-2007-0494.
Technical Details
=================
Issue #1: \* (ANY) query processing
This issue is relating to the way in which the server processes
a type \* (ANY) query. In order for this attack to be successful
the query must return multiple RRsets in the answer section. In
addition to this the server must be configured with dnssec
validation enabled.
Issue #2: Recursive query handling
This issue is relating to the way in which the server processes
recursive queries. The request, in this case, can cause named to
read a freed fetch context. The server needs to be enabled to
receive recursive queries in order for this attack to be successful.
Solutions and Workarounds
=========================
If you have not enabled dnssec validation in your name server then you
are not vulnerable to the \* (ANY) denial of service attack. Both
vulnerabilities can be mitigated by limiting who can perform specific
queries against the name server.
In particular, it is recommended practice, regardless of this
vulnerability, to accept recursive queries only from local clients who
would be expected to query this nameserver directly, not from unknown
Internet sources. The 'allow-recursion' directive in the options
section of named.conf should be configured with an appropriate address
list, as in the following simple example:
options {
directory "/etc/namedb";
allow-recursion { 1.2.3.4/24; 127.0.0.1/32; ::1; };
};
It is recommended that NetBSD users of vulnerable versions update
their binaries.
The following instructions describe how to upgrade your bind
binaries by updating your source tree and rebuilding and
installing a new version of bind.
\* NetBSD-current:
Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2007-01-27
should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2007-01-28 or later.
Due to the amount of changes introduced in the BIND upgrade
in CVS HEAD it is recommended that users of NetBSD-current
perform a full system upgrade to sources dated after 2007-01-28.
For more information on how to do this, see:
http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/current/
\* NetBSD 3.\*:
Systems running NetBSD 3.\* sources dated from before
2007-03-04 should be upgraded from NetBSD 3.\* sources dated
2007-03-05 or later.
The following files need to be updated from the
netbsd-3 or netbsd-3-1 branch:
dist/bind/lib/dns/resolver.c
dist/bind/lib/dns/validator.c
dist/bind/lib/dns/include/dns/validator.h
dist/bind/version
To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install bind:
# cd src
# cvs update -r  dist/bind/lib/dns/resolver.c
# cvs update -r  dist/bind/lib/dns/validator.c
# cvs update -r  \
dist/bind/lib/dns/include/dns/validator.h
# cvs update -r  dist/bind/version
# cd usr.sbin/bind
# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
# make USETOOLS=no install
The following directories need to be updated from the
netbsd-3-0 branch:
dist/bind
usr.sbin/bind
To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install bind:
# cd src
# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-3-0 dist/bind
# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-3-0 usr.sbin/bind
# cd usr.sbin/bind
# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
# make USETOOLS=no install
Thanks To
=========
The Internet Software Consortium is credited with the discovery and
correction of both issues.
Revision History
================
2007-03-08 Initial release
2007-03-18 Updated netbsd-3-0 branch instructions

More details about the issues may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0493   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0494  Here are the details from the Slackware 11.0 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/bind-9.3.4-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:   Upgraded to bind-9.3.4.

bind security update (RHSA-2007-0044)

Original Release Date: March 27, 2007

Last Revised: July 1, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-125

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) provides tools and a server for
the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocols.

BIND was found to contain a bug in the way it handled specific types
of
DNS query responses. A remote attacker could possibly cause a remote
Denial of
Service (DoS) condition on servers using DNSSEC validation.
A flaw was found in the way BIND processed certain DNS query responses.
On
servers that had enabled DNSSEC validation, this could allow a remote
attacker to cause a denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures
Project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2007-0494](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0494) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0044.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with bind installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity LX | 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 | Low | This will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.0, 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MSS 4.0 or later. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of bind, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and
network
access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the
use of
physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and
can be
installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly
but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers
should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and
then follow that vendor's guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux or remove the affected
package.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# BIND: Denial of service — GLSA **200702-06**

ISC BIND contains two vulnerabilities allowing a Denial of Service under
certain conditions.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-dns/bind** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **9.3.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **9.3.4**revision >= **9.2.8** |

### Background

ISC BIND is the Internet Systems Consortium implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocol.

### Description

An unspecified improper usage of an already freed context has been
reported. Additionally, an assertion error could be triggered in the
DNSSEC validation of some responses to type ANY queries with multiple
RRsets.

### Impact

A remote attacker could crash the server through unspecified vectors
or, if DNSSEC validation is enabled, by sending certain crafted ANY
queries.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time for the first issue. The
DNSSEC validation Denial of Service can be prevented by disabling
DNSSEC validation until the upgrade to a fixed version. Note that
DNSSEC validation is disabled on a default configuration.

### Resolution

All ISC BIND 9.3 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/bind-9.3.4"
```

All ISC BIND 9.2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/bind-9.2.8"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
