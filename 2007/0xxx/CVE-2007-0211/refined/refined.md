Root cause of vulnerability: A function parameter in the hardware initialization and detection capabilities of Microsoft Windows Shell was not properly validated.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Privilege escalation vulnerability in the Windows Shell Hardware Detection service.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, potentially leading to the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

Attack vectors:
    - Local, authenticated attacker executing a specially crafted application
    - Exploitation of the vulnerability by forcing a hardware detection and initialization event
    - Can be triggered locally or through a terminal services session

Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Valid logon credentials to the target system.
    - Ability to execute a specially crafted application on the target system.
    -  (For remote exploitation in some cases) Administrator privileges on the target machine running Windows XP Service Pack 2 or Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1.
