How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Related Check-ins:

| 2006-Aug-16 23:02 |  | Check-in [[852]](chngview?cn=852): ([#645](tktview?tn=645 "/rlog trying to display contents of file?")) merge [[850]](chngview?cn=850) and [[851]](chngview?cn=851) into HEAD. (By cpb) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2006-Aug-16 13:48 |  | Check-in [[850]](chngview?cn=850) on branch css-patches: ([#645](tktview?tn=645 "/rlog trying to display contents of file?")) tighten up the check in `is_repository_file()` so it actually uses the %q formatter rather than relying on %s. (By cpb) |
| 2006-May-22 21:27 |  | Check-in [[782]](chngview?cn=782): ([#551](tktview?tn=551 "vxprintf() misbehaving when truncating strings?")) Avoid the use of "%.\*q". We can safely get away with it here because we already filter the strings in other places (`is_wiki_name()`, `isalpha()`, `is_eow()`). (By cpb) |

SECURITY ADVISORY
=================
Application: CVSTrac
Version: 2.0.0
Vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Identification: CVE-2007-0347
Date: 2007-01-29 12:00 UTC
DESCRIPTION
-----------
A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in CVSTrac
(http://www.cvstrac.org/) version 2.0.0, a web-based bug and patch-set
tracking system for the version control systems CVS, Subversion and Git.
The vulnerability is in the Wiki-style text output formatter and is
triggered by special text constructs in commit messages, tickets and
Wiki pages. Only users with check-in permissions and Wiki or ticket edit
permissions can perform an attack. But as the anonymous user usually
is granted Wiki edit and ticket creation permissions, an attacker
remotely and anonymously can cause a partial DoS (depending on the pages
requested) on a CVSTrac installation by opening a new ticket or editing
a Wiki page with an arbitrary text containing for instance the string
"/foo/bar'quux".
The result of an attack is an error of the underlying SQLite RDBMS:
| Database Error
| db\_exists: Database exists query failed
| SELECT filename FROM filechng WHERE filename='foo/bar'quux'
| Reason: near "quux": syntax error
ANALYSIS
--------
The DoS vulnerability exists because the is\_eow() function in "format.c"
does NOT just check the first(!) character of the supplied string
for an End-Of-Word terminating character, but instead iterates over
string and this way can skip a single embedded quotation mark. The
is\_repository\_file() function then in turn assumes that the filename
string can never contain a single quotation mark and traps into an SQL
escaping problem.
An SQL injection via this technique is somewhat limited as is\_eow()
bails on whitespace. So while one \_can\_ do an SQL injection, one is
limited to SQL queries containing only characters which get past the
function isspace(3). This effectively limits attacks to SQL commands
like "VACUUM".
WORKAROUND
----------
Administrators can quickly workaround by revoking permissions on the
users. Restoring those permissions, obviously, would require keeping
vulnerable permissions on at least one infrequently used account like
"setup" or using the CLI sqlite3(1) to manually add them back later.
One can resurrect an attacked CVSTrac 2.0.0 by fixing the texts in the
underlying SQLite database with the following small Perl script.
