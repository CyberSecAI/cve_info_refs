Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-0347:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `is_eow()` function within the `format.c` file of CVSTrac. This function is intended to identify the end of a word by checking for whitespace or specific characters. However, the function incorrectly iterates over the string, potentially skipping single embedded quotation marks within a word.
*   The `is_repository_file()` function then assumes that filenames will not contain single quotes and uses an unsafe SQL escaping mechanism, leading to an SQL syntax error when such characters are present, which can lead to a Denial of Service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The `is_eow()` function fails to correctly handle single quotes within a string, leading to an exploitable state.
*   **SQL Injection (Limited):** Due to the flawed input validation in `is_eow()`, an SQL injection vulnerability exists. Although the exploitability is limited as is\_eow() bails on whitespace, it can still be used to trigger specific SQL commands, leading to a denial-of-service.
*   **Denial of Service:** By crafting specific text containing single quotes within file paths (e.g., `/foo/bar'quux`), an attacker can trigger an SQL error, causing a partial Denial of Service (DoS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The primary impact is a **Denial of Service (DoS)**. The application becomes partially or fully unresponsive due to the errors in the underlying database.
*   While SQL injection is possible, it is limited due to restrictions on whitespace and only allows SQL commands containing characters that pass the `isspace(3)` check.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by inserting a crafted string containing a single quote in a file path within user-contributed content.
*   This can occur via commit messages, tickets, or Wiki pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker requires the ability to create or edit tickets or Wiki pages or check-in code, which usually means having an account with the necessary permissions on the CVSTrac system. However, often anonymous users are allowed to create tickets or edit wikis.
*   The attack can be performed remotely.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in CVSTrac version 2.0.1
*   A patch was released by the vendor (check-in 852), and is detailed within the security advisory.
*   A Perl script was also provided to fix a database that was already attacked.
*   The issue was initially reported on January 17, 2007, and fixed by January 29, 2007
