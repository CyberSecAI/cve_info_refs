This product can SEARCH and INDEX the contents of a entire web site,additionally this product doesn't validate user input. So these types of attacks are possible.
-URL redirection (So Phising attacks can be easy)
-Cross Site Scripting
-Business Logic can be revealed trough Searching some type of characters
-Some Others
-URL redirection
http://target/?http://www.hackersite.com
and the hacker site is displayed in the main FRAME of www.somesite.com
-Cross Site Scripting
http://target/buscador/buscador.htm?%3CIFRAME%20SRC=%22javascript:alert(
