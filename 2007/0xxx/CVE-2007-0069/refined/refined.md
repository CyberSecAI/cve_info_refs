If exploited, this vulnerability may result in arbitrary code execution or a denial-of-service condition.\n\n### Description\n\n| Internet Group Management Protoco (IGMP) is the protocol used by IPv4 hosts to report their multicast group memberships to multicast routers. Version 3 (IGMPv3) adds support for source filtering. IGMP, IGMPv2 and IGMPv3 are specified in RFC [1112](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1112), RFC [2236](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2236), and RFC [3376](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3376).  Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) is a protocol used by IPv6 routers to discover the presence of nodes who can receive multicast packets. MLD version 2 (MLDv2) adds source address filtering capabilities. MLD and MLDv2 are specified in RFC [2710](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2710) and RFC [3810](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3810).Per Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS08-001](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-001.mspx):*A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows kernel due to the way that the Windows kernel handles TCP/IP structures storing the state of IGMPv3 and MLDv2 queries. Supported editions of Microsoft Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista all support IGMPv3. In addition to IGMPv3, Windows Vista supports MDLv2, which adds multicast support for IPv6 networks. An anonymous attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted IGMPv3 and MLDv2 packets to a computer over the network. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.*Note that Windows 2000 is not affected by this vulnerability. |\n| --- |\n\n### Impact\n\n| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition. If a vulnerable system is being used as a network firewall or router, clients relying on that system may also be affected. |\n| --- |\n\n### Solution\n\n| **Update**Microsoft has released an update to address this issue. See [MS08-001](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-001.mspx) for more information. |\n| --- |\n\n| **Disable IGMP and MLD**Until updates can be applied disabling IGMP and MLD support may mitigate this vulnerability. See the workarounds section of [MS08-001](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-001.mspx) for more information on disabling IGMP and MLD support in Windows.**Block IGMP and MLD**Using network or host based firewalls to block IGMP and MLD network traffic may prevent this vulnerability from being remotely exploited.     + The workarounds section of [MS08-001](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-001.mspx) contains instructions on how to configure the Windows Vista host firewall to block IGMP and MLD. *Note that per the Microsoft TechNet article* [*How Windows Firewall Works*](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/3ccb6af5-d960-4a8d-b12b-70692dc47bf41033.mspx?mfr=true) *Windows XP and Server 2003 allow IGMP traffic to pass through the built-in Windows Firewall.* + Linux system administrators may use the iptables -p parameter to block the IGMP and MLD protocols. + Administrators who use PF can set the proto keyword to block the IGMP and MLD protocols. + Cisco ASA administrators can disable IGMP support by using the no igmp command as specified in section 11-14 of the Cisco Security Appliance Command Line [Configuration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/asa/asa72/configuration/guide/conf_gd.html). |\n| --- |\n\n### Vendor Information\n\n115083\nFilter by status:\nAll\nAffected\nNot Affected\nUnknown\n\nFilter by content:\n Additional information available\n\n Sort by:\nStatus\nAlphabetical\n\nExpand all\n\n**Javascript is disabled.

Therefore, while Windows Server 2003 is rated as having a severity rating of Important, Windows Small Business Server 2003 and Windows Home Server merit a severity rating of Critical.\n\n## Windows Kernel TCP/IP/IGMPv3 and MLDv2 Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0069\n\nA remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows kernel due to the way that the Windows kernel handles TCP/IP structures storing the state of IGMPv3 and MLDv2 queries. Supported editions of Microsoft Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista all support IGMPv3. In addition to IGMPv3, Windows Vista supports MDLv2, which adds multicast support for IPv6 networks. An anonymous attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted IGMPv3 and MLDv2 packets to a computer over the network. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n\nTo view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-0069](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0069).\n\n#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Kernel TCP/IP/IGMPv3 and MLDv2 Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0069\n\nMitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:\n\n*   Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. Perimeter firewalls that block multicast traffic (IGMPv3 and MLDv2 specifically) help protect internal network assets from this attack that originate outside of the enterprise perimeter.\n*   Microsoft Windows 2000 is not affected by this vulnerability.\n*   Windows Server 2003 by default does not have any multicast addresses active and would not be affected by this vulnerability. However, installing applications that use multicasting could cause the operating system to become vulnerable.\n*   Attacks attempting to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in a denial of service condition. However remote code execution could be possible.\n\n#### Workarounds for Windows Kernel TCP/IP/IGMPv3 and MLDv2 Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0069\n\nWorkaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality.\n\n*   **Disable IGMP and MLD processing**\n\n    You can help prevent attempts to exploit the IGMP vulnerability by modifying the IGMPLevel control in the registry.\n\n    **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the \"Changing Keys And Values\" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the \"Add and Delete Information in the Registry\" and \"Edit Registry Data\" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.\n\n    **Note** We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.\n\n    To disable IGMP and MLD processing, following these steps:\n\n    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedit** and then click **OK**.\n    2.  Expand **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE**.\n    3.  Expand **SYSTEM**, expand **CurrentControlSe**t, and then expand **Services**.\n    4.  Expand **TCPIP**, expand **Parameters**, and then expand **IGMPLevel**.\n    5.  Change the **DWORD** value to 0.\n\n    **Note** You must restart the system for your changes to take effect.\n\n    **Impact of workaround:** IGMPv3 and MLDv2 will be disabled. Applications that depend on this service will no longer function as designed.\n\n    **How to undo the workaround:** Use the steps above to set the registry key setting to its original value or delete this registry key setting. By default this registry key setting is not present.\n*   **Block IGMP and MLD on perimeter firewalls**\n\n    Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from IGMP and MLD attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter.\n\n    **Impact of workaround:** IGMPv3 and MLDv2 will be blocked from outside the enterprise perimeter, and applications that depend on IGMPv3 and MLDv2 from outside the enterprise perimeter will no longer function as designed.\n*   **Block IGMP and MLD inbound on Vista Firewall**\n\n    Click **Control Panel**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then double-click **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security**.\n\n    To Block IGMP:\n\n    1.  Select **inbound rules**.\n    2.  Select **Core Networking - Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP-In).**\n    3.  Right-click **select properties.**\n    4.  Select **Block the connections**.\n\n    To Block MLD:\n\n    1.  Select **inbound rules**.\n    2.  Select **Core Networking - Multicast Listener Query (ICMPv6-In)**.\n    3.  Right-click **select properties**.\n    4.  Select **Block the connections**.\n*   **Impact of workaround:** IGMP/MLD will be blocked and applications or services that rely on multicast will no longer function.\n\n    **How to undo the workaround:** Use the first three steps above and select **Allow the connections**.\n\n#### FAQ for Windows Kernel TCP/IP/IGMPv3 and MLDv2 Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0069\n\n**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**\n\nThis is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated privileges on vulnerable systems. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n\n**What causes the vulnerability?**\n\nThe Windows kernel performs insufficient validation when storing the state of IGMP requests processed by TCP/IP.\n\n**What is TCP/IP?**\n\nTCP/IP is the suite of communications protocols used for transmitting data over networks.\n\n**Why is the vulnerability rating different for Windows Small Business Server and Windows Home Server than Windows Server 2003?**\n\nWindows Server 2003 by default does not have IGMP active and therefore is less exposed to this vulnerability. However, Windows Small Business Server 2003 and Windows Home Server have IGMP active by default, resulting in an increased risk to this vulnerability. The increased risk merits a severity rating of Critical for Windows Small Business Server 2003 and Windows Home Server. We recommend that customers with these products install this update immediately.\n\n**What is IGMP?**\n\nInternet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is used for IPv4 multicast. A multicast is communication between a single sender and multiple receivers on a network. IGMP is used to exchange membership status data between IPv4 routers that support multicasting and members of multicast groups. See the MSDN site for more information on IGMP.\n\n**What is MLD?**\n\nMulticast Listener Discovery (MLD) enables you to manage subnet multicast membership for IPv6. MLD is a series of three Internet Control Message Protocols for IPv6 (ICMPv6) messages that replaces the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) that is used for IPv4. See the MSDN site for more information on [MLD](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms882958.aspx).\n\n**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**\n\nAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n\n**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**\n\nAn attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating specially crafted network packets and sending the packets to an affected system.\n\n**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**\n\nClient systems are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. However, any systems that use multicasting could be affected by this vulnerability.\n\n**What does the update do?**\n\nThe update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Windows kernel processes TCP/IP structures that contain IGMP requests.\n\n**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**\n\nNo. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued. This security bulletin addresses the privately disclosed vulnerability as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations.\n\n**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**\n\nNo. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.\n",
