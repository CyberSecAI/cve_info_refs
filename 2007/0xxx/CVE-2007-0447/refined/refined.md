Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0447:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Symantec AntiVirus Engine's CAB archive parsing routine. The parsing process implicitly trusts user-supplied values within the CAB archive, which leads to an exploitable heap corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap Overflow: A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the improper handling of user-supplied data when parsing CAB archive files.
- Implicit Trust of User-Supplied Values: The parsing routine does not adequately validate user-provided values, resulting in memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems running affected versions of the Symantec AntiVirus Engine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously Formatted CAB Archives: The vulnerability is triggered when the AntiVirus Engine scans multiple maliciously crafted CAB archive files.
- Remote Exploitation: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without requiring user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to deliver malicious CAB archive files: An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted CAB archive that will be processed by the vulnerable Symantec AntiVirus Engine.
- No user interaction required: The attack doesn't require any actions from the user other than their system processing a malicious CAB file, often through the automatic scanning process of the antivirus software.
