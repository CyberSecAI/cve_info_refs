      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-0581",
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_9fa8bdf3_20250125_192911.html",
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to the insecure use of the 'phpbb_root_path' variable in the `require` statement.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include a remote file, potentially executing arbitrary code on the server.",
      "attack_vector": "By manipulating the `phpbb_root_path` parameter in the URL, an attacker can specify a malicious remote file to be included.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a modified `phpbb_root_path` parameter to the vulnerable application. They need access to a server to host the malicious file.",
      "details": "The vulnerable code is `require($phpbb_root_path . 'includes/bbcode.'.$phpEx);`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject code by controlling the `phpbb_root_path` variable through the query string. The provided exploit code demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability by providing a URL to a malicious php file which gets executed by the webserver."
