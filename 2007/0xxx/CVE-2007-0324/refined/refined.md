**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-0324

**Vulnerability:** Multiple buffer overflows in LizardTech DjVu Browser Plug-in before 6.1.1.

**Root Cause:**  The LizardTech DjVu Browser Plug-in, used for viewing DjVu documents within web browsers, contains multiple buffer overflows in various functions. One specific example is the `ExportImageAs` method.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Buffer Overflow:**  The primary weakness is the presence of multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities. These occur when the software writes data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the user. This could allow the attacker to take control of the system.
*   **Browser Crash:** The vulnerability can also be exploited to cause the web browser to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.
*   **Crafted HTML Document:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by convincing users to view specially crafted HTML documents, such as web pages, HTML email messages or attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is considered low.
*  **Remote network access:** The attacker needs to be able to get the user to view a malicious HTML document.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Windows DjVu Browser Plug-in versions prior to 6.1.1.
*   The issue was reported by both CERT/CC and Brett Moore of Security-Assessment.com around the same time.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Update:** Upgrade to the DjVu Browser Plug-in version 6.1.1 or later.
*   **Disable ActiveX:** Disable the DjVu ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for CLSID `{0e8d0700-75df-11d3-8b4a-0008c7450c4a}`
*   **Disable ActiveX:** Disable ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone to prevent exploitation.
