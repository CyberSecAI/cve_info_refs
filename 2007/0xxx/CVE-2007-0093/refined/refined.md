CVE-2007-0093:

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the 'id' parameter of the 'page.php' script, allowing for SQL injection.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- SQL Injection vulnerability.
- The application does not sanitize or validate user input for the 'id' parameter.

Impact of exploitation:
- Attackers can bypass authentication.
- Attackers can read sensitive data, such as the username and password for the admin section, which are stored in the configuration file (`config.php`).
- Arbitrary file reading can occur using `load_file()`.

Attack vectors:
-  The vulnerability is triggered through HTTP GET requests.
- The vulnerable parameter is 'id' in the `page.php` script.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
-  The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
-  No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
