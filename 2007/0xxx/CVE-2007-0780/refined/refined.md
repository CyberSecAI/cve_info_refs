Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2007-0780:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from how SeaMonkey and Firefox handle blocked popups, specifically when a user chooses to open them. The browser does not properly validate the origin of the script within the opened popup if the source is a `data:` URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** If an attacker can convince a user to open a blocked popup that has a `javascript:` URL within a frame sourced from a `data:` URL, a cross-site scripting attack can be performed against any site that contains that frame
*   **Local file access:** Normally, web pages cannot open windows containing local files. This restriction is bypassed if a user can be convinced to open a blocked popup
*   **Insecure Handling of Data URLs:** The browser's popup blocker did not properly validate the origin of popups with data URLs and `javascript:` URLs when being unblocked

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **XSS attacks:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into a site, potentially modifying content or stealing sensitive data like passwords
*   **Local file theft:** Attackers can bypass security restrictions and steal data from the local file system by opening a popup that loads a local HTML file with a malicious payload

**Attack vectors:**
*   **User-initiated action:** The attack requires the user to click on a link or perform some action that causes a popup to be generated. Then, the user needs to explicitly allow the blocked popup.
*   **Malicious Website:** A website controlled by an attacker frames a target website, and then generates a popup with a malicious javascript: URL from a `data:` URL iframe
*   **Data URL:** The vulnerability is triggered by a `data:` URL being improperly validated as the source of the frame within a blocked popup

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must have the ability to host a malicious website
*   The attacker needs the capability to entice the user to open the blocked popup
* The attacker must be able to determine a predictable temporary file path if they are attempting to load local files

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is described as moderate severity because of the user interaction required to trigger it.
*   The fix involves ensuring that popups use the actual requesting window rather than relying on the requesting URI to find the child window.
*   The fix also adds a check to verify if the document in the requesting window is still the same to prevent security vulnerabilities.
*   The fix was implemented to pass the actual window object used to open the blocked popup instead of a requesting URI. This was done to ensure that the correct window context was used when showing a blocked popup.
*   The vulnerability affects SeaMonkey and Firefox and was addressed in versions 1.0.8 and 1.5.0.10/2.0.0.2, respectively.
