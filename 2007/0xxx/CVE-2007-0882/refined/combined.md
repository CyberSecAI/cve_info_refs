## Sun Solaris telnet authentication bypass vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#881872

Original Release Date: 2007-02-12 | Last Revised: 2008-07-21

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the Sun Solaris telnet daemon (in.telnetd) could allow a remote attacker to log on to the system with elevated privileges.

### Description

| The Sun Solaris telnet daemon may accept authentication information via the USER environment variable. However, the daemon does not properly sanitize this information before passing it to the login program, and login makes unsafe assumptions about the information. This may allow a remote attacker to trivially bypass the telnet and login authentication mechanisms. In some default configurations of Solaris this vulnerability cannot be exploited to gain access to the root account, but it can be used to gain privileges of other accounts, such as adm and lp.  According to Sun, Solaris 10 (SunOS 5.10) and Solaris "Nevada" (SunOS 5.11) are affected by this issue. More information is available in Sun Alert Notification [102802](http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-102802-1) and in Alan Hargreaves' blog, [here](http://blogs.sun.com/tpenta/entry/the_in_telnetd_vulnerability_exploit) and [here](http://blogs.sun.com/tpenta/entry/more_on_the_in_telnetd).This vulnerability is being exploited by a worm, for more information see the [Security Sun Alert Feed](http://blogs.sun.com/security/entry/solaris_in_telnetd_worm_seen) and Technical Alert [TA07-059A](http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/techalerts/TA07-059A.html). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could log on to a vulnerable system via telnet and gain elevated privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**Apply the patches referenced in Sun Alert Notification [102802](http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-102802-1). |
| --- |

| **Disable telnet**Disable telnet if it's not needed. Telnet can be disabled by issuing the following command:   # svcadm disable telnet **Restrict access**You may wish to block access to the vulnerable software from outside your network perimeter, specifically by blocking access to the ports used by Sun Solaris telnet (typically 23/tcp). This will limit your exposure to attacks.**Prefer SSH over telnet**SSH provides a comparatively more secure method for remotely logging into a system than telnet. As general advice, we recommend using SSH rather than telnet. |

### Trivial remote Solaris 0day, disable telnet now.

NOTE: Following link may not we work safe due to cartoon...
<http://www.com-winner.com/0day_was_the_case_that_they_gave_me.pdf>

Oh jeez, that’s not good. This was [posted to Full-Disclosure](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Feb/0217.html). Remote root exploit in the Solaris 10/11 telnet daemon. It doesn’t require any skill, any exploit knowledge, and can be scripted for mass attacks. Basically if you pass a “-fusername” as an argument to the –l option you get full access to the OS as the user specified. In my example I do it as bin but it worked for regular users, just not for root. This combined with a reliable local privilege escalation exploit would be devastating. Expect mass scanning and possibly the widespread exploitation of this vulnerability.

And example of the command line is

telnet -l "-fbin" target\_address

Please disable telnet on Solaris at this time. The [HEV](http://www.erratasec.com/products.html) for this will be shipping to ErrataSec customers within the hour.

UPDATE: There seems to be some conflicting reports about this vulnerability working with the root account. This does not work on a default install of Solaris 10. By default a variable is set in /etc/default/login called CONSOLE. If this variable is set then root is not allowed to login from anywhere but the console. Commenting this variable out allows root to login from anywhere and allows this vulnerability to take advantage of the telnet exploit. Below is a pic of my trying it with console set then with console commented out. ![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-ZiXF84_5g-AhNLZzB5E22cM9YyT7nbabTdB8R0o5PcYXV7zWDXhvJiCvkPpZ0-Cg4YDq40bYx5JkZDQ-miAg_y5o9FpNWNYfVEpiSuoohGra2Dd0JB00zyhyon-7fNd5ywMN3Q/s400/Solaris_root_3.png)

Isn't this nearly identical to the aix/linux rlogin -froot bug from years past (apart from not working for root)? Amazing.

It is pretty much the same. It amazes me this bug went unseen for this long.

my gosh, such humility! thank you kingcope for this wonderful 0-day exploit!!@#!

it's not the disclosure that is important here, however. it's the message. kcope was definitely trying to say something when he made the subject line **"0day was the case that they gave me"** on the full-disclosure mailing-list. this is one of those **classically good times for full-disclosure** without notifying the vendor beforehand.

in my opinion, kcope was trying to tell the vulnerability research community that he thinks the samy indictment was too harsh. in other words, "the charges were incorrectly filed by the prosecution because of cultural differences". it's something akin to **the punishment does not fit the crime**, but suggests more of a .

if you didn't catch the reference, Snoop Dogg has a song/video/short-film/soundtrack called **Murder Was the Case** [that they gave me]. assuming that i understand [this article](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/imdb/reviews/article_display.jsp?rid=607858) correctly, it appears that Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre made the movie in response to what was acceptable by the media circa 1994. if you're black and carry a gun - that makes you evil and a murderer - according to the moral majority. Snoop was being charged with murder (IRL) at the time, and pleaded self-defense. His movie-short tried to convey that everyone is a victim when gunplay is a part of everyday life.

it also appears that kcope and samy released their 0days in response to what is acceptable by the security incident response community. if you're a hacker and release a 0day - that makes you evil and a computer-criminal - according to today's moral majority. kcope's vulnerability disclosure is trying to convey that everyone is a victim when **mickey-mouse security-bypasses** are so prevalent.

You're not a criminal, but don't be a dick -- throw the vendor a frickin' bone over here. No attempt was made to make contact and keep this secret before blowing it out there? Criminal? No. Irresponsible? Yes.

We didn't disclose it. It was posted by another person to the full-disclosure mailing list. We were warning people this information is public and to disable telnet.

The person who released that exploit was right to do so.
It's such a simple exploit that it shouldn't have been there in the first place.

If was given to Sun first and they released a patch then it would have the same impact.

Sun already had their chance to fix them problem when they developed the software, releasing the exploit to the wild gets the users of the software to put more pressure on developers to develop secure code.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
