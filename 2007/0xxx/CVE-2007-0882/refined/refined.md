```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The Sun Solaris telnet daemon (in.telnetd) accepts authentication information via the USER environment variable without properly sanitizing it before passing it to the login program. The login program makes unsafe assumptions about this information.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied input (USER environment variable)
- Unsafe assumptions about the input by the login program

Impact of exploitation:
A remote attacker can bypass telnet and login authentication mechanisms, gain elevated privileges and potentially log on to the system. In some default configurations of Solaris, it can be used to gain privileges of other accounts, such as adm and lp, but not root unless CONSOLE variable is disabled.

Attack vectors:
- Sending a crafted USER environment variable via the telnet protocol. Specifically, by using the "-fusername" argument with the telnet "-l" option.
  Example: telnet -l "-fbin" target_address

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Remote network access to a vulnerable Solaris system running the telnet service.
- Ability to initiate a telnet connection to the target machine.
