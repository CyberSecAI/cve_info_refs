How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Concurrency strikes MSIE (potentially exploitable msxml3 flaws)

A while ago, apparently angry with Larry Seltzer, I penned a quick
write-up on the possible issues with race conditions triggered by
asynchronous browser events (such as JavaScript timers) colliding with
synchronous content rendering:

  <http://seclists.org/vulnwatch/2006/q3/0023.html>

This is in principle similar to signal handling bugs. I gave an example of
a seemingly exploitable flaw in Firefox (see MFSA2006-59 report for more
details), but did mention that other browsers are unlikely to be immune.

Today, inspired by Brian Krebs' report on MSIE's stellar track of security
response that we all owe to responsible disclosure, I thought it would be
a brilliant idea to test MSIE for the same class of problems (they had
half a year to take notice of my original rant).

Hey, and - no peeking! - guess what happened?

A quick demonstration of how MSIE succumbs to such problems would be to
prepare an XML file that contains a bunch of nested tags (10-1000 is
fine), then display it in IFRAME, repeatedly disrupting the rendering
process with a Javascript timer that forces the frame to be reloaded every
50-100 miliseconds or so.

After just a couple reloads, MSIE will freeze, then crash in a random
manner in the vicinity of msxml3 module. I observed seemingly harmless
NULL pointer dereferences, writes to bogus addresses, reads from
unallocated memory, and various other signs of memory corruption typical
of such race conditions. The exact mode of crash depends on precise timing
and the contents of browser memory (previously / concurrently displayed
pages, contents of the rest of the document), but this is obviously well
within the control of a determined attacker.

As such, it is my guess that although (as with all race conditions) this
would be fairly hard to exploit remotely in a reliable way, it is within
the realm of possibility.

A quick "vanilla" but reasonably reliable demo that will probably freeze
then crash your browser on a NULL pointer dereference (or sometimes a
mangled target pointer on REP MOVSW or something along these lines, if you
came there from some other website) can be found at:

  <http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/iediex/iediex.html>

...try using the 'genie.sh' utility provided in the same directory to
generate more elaborate test cases that, combined with additional contents
of the pages will likely trigger more interesting memory corruption
scenarios.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-069 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft XML Core Services Could Allow Remote Code Execution (955218)

Published: November 11, 2008 | Updated: July 12, 2011

**Version:** 4.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves several vulnerabilities in Microsoft XML Core Services. The most severe vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft XML Core Services 3.0 and Important for Microsoft XML Core Services 4.0, Microsoft XML Core Services 5.0, and Microsoft XML Core Services 6.0. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft XML Core Services parses XML content, handles external document type definitions (DTD), and sets HTTP request fields. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 955218](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/955218) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Where are the file information details?**

The file information details can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 955218](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/955218).

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

The security updates offered in this bulletin contain changes to functionality no longer allowing MSXML the ability to control transfer encoding.

In addition to the changes that are listed in the **Vulnerability Information** section of this bulletin, this update includes a defense-in-depth change to XMLHTTP to prevent HTTP-only cookies from being accessed through a client-side script.

**Does this update contain any non-security related changes to functionality?**

The updates that are offered by this security bulletin will also include additional updates that are in the current Service Pack offerings for the respective versions of MSXML.

**What is Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML)?**

Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) allows customers who use JScript, Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript), and Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 to develop XML-based applications that provide interoperability with other applications that adhere to the XML 1.0 standard. For more information, see the MSDN site, [MSXML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms763742.aspx).

**What version of Microsoft XML Core Services is installed on my system?**

Microsoft XML Core Services is included in additional non-operating system software from Microsoft and is also available as separate downloads. For information about the different Microsoft XML Core Services versions that are available and the products that install them, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 269238](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/269238).

**Note** Depending on which versions of Microsoft XML Core Services you have installed on your system, you may be offered more than one security update from this security bulletin.

**2007 Microsoft Office System installs Microsoft XML Core Services 5.0 and Microsoft XML Core Services 6.0, but the update for 2007 Microsoft Office System only contains Microsoft XML Core Services 5.0. Am I still vulnerable if I only apply the 2007 Microsoft Office System update?**

Customers should apply the Microsoft XML Core Services 6.0 update when Microsoft XML Core Services 6.0 is installed on their system. Customers who have already applied the Microsoft XML Core Services 6.0 update and then later install 2007 Microsoft Office System will not need to reapply the Microsoft XML Core Services 6.0 update to remain protected.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these software versions or editions, visit [Microsoft Product Support Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33328).

## MSXML DTD Cross-Domain Scripting Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4029

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft XML Core Services handles error checks for external document type definitions (DTDs). The vulnerability could allow information disclosure if a user browses a Web site that contains specially crafted content or opens specially crafted HTML e-mail. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read data from a Web page in another domain in Internet Explorer. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-4029](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4029).

#### Mitigating Factors for MSXML DTD Cross-Domain Scripting Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4029

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability In addition, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content, or compromised Web sites and advertisement servers could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce the number of successful attacks that exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail, they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/security/szone/overview/esc_changes.asp). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that have not been added to Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for MSXML DTD Cross-Domain Scripting Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4029

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK.**
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in the heading "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.**

MSXML allows certain HTTP request fields to be set by clients, enabling session state corruption, leading to the possibility of information disclosure.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read data from another domain in Internet Explorer.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by hosting a specially crafted Web site that is designed to invoke MSXML through Internet Explorer. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and visits a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by no longer allowing clients to set certain HTTP request fields.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. **Note** Not applicable for Microsoft XML Core Services 4.0 or Microsoft XML Core Services 6.0 when installed on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, or Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Removing the Update**

* **Removing MSXML 4.0**

  This version of Microsoft XML Core Services is installed in a side-by-side mode with pervious versions of MSXML4. Follow these steps to remove the security update:

  1. Remove the security update by using the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.
  2. Delete the Msxml4.dll file from the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder.
  3. Repair previous Msxml4.dll by using the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

**Note** The previous versions of the Msxml4.dll and Msxml4r.dll files are restored to both the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder and the side-by-side folder %SystemRoot%\WinSxS.

The security updates for MSXML 3.0 and MSXML 6.0 support the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |

| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.

This security update requires that Windows Installer 3.1 or later be installed on the system.

To install the 3.1 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:

* [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang;=en)
* [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang;=en)

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

Supported Security Update Installation Switches

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?** or **/help** | Displays usage dialog. |
| **/passive** | Specifies passive mode. Requires no user interaction; users see basic progress dialogs but cannot cancel. |
| **/quiet** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/norestart** | Suppresses restarting the system if the update requires a restart. |
| **/quiet /forcerestart** | Automatically restarts the system after applying the update, regardless of whether the update requires the restart. |
| **/extract** | Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/extract:<path>** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |
| **/lang:<LCID>** | Forces the use of a specific language, when the update package supports that language. |
| **/log:<log file>** | Enables logging, by both Vnox and Installer, during the update installation. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
