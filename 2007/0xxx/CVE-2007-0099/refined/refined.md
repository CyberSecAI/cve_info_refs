I gave an example of\na seemingly exploitable flaw in Firefox (see MFSA2006-59 report for more\ndetails), but did mention that other browsers are unlikely to be immune.\n\nToday, inspired by Brian Krebs' report on MSIE's stellar track of security\nresponse that we all owe to responsible disclosure, I thought it would be\na brilliant idea to test MSIE for the same class of problems (they had\nhalf a year to take notice of my original rant).\n\nHey, and - no peeking! - guess what happened?\n\nA quick demonstration of how MSIE succumbs to such problems would be to\nprepare an XML file that contains a bunch of nested tags (10-1000 is\nfine), then display it in IFRAME, repeatedly disrupting the rendering\nprocess with a Javascript timer that forces the frame to be reloaded every\n50-100 miliseconds or so.\n\nAfter just a couple reloads, MSIE will freeze, then crash in a random\nmanner in the vicinity of msxml3 module. I observed seemingly harmless\nNULL pointer dereferences, writes to bogus addresses, reads from\nunallocated memory, and various other signs of memory corruption typical\nof such race conditions. The exact mode of crash depends on precise timing\nand the contents of browser memory (previously / concurrently displayed\npages, contents of the rest of the document), but this is obviously well\nwithin the control of a determined attacker.\n\nAs such, it is my guess that although (as with all race conditions) this\nwould be fairly hard to exploit remotely in a reliable way, it is within\nthe realm of possibility.\n\nA quick \"vanilla\" but reasonably reliable demo that will probably freeze\nthen crash your browser on a NULL pointer dereference (or sometimes a\nmangled target pointer on REP MOVSW or something along these lines, if you\ncame there from some other website) can be found at:\n\n  <http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/iediex/iediex.html>\n\n...try using the 'genie.sh' utility provided in the same directory to\ngenerate more elaborate test cases that, combined with additional contents\nof the pages will likely trigger more interesting memory corruption\nscenarios.\n\n/mz\n```",

The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user browses a Web site that contains specially crafted content or opens specially crafted HTML e-mail. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n```\n\n```\n#### FAQ for MSXML Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0099\n\n**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**\n\nThis is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n\n**What causes the vulnerability?**\n\nWhen XML content is parsed, MSXML may corrupt the system state in such a way that an attacker could run arbitrary code.\n\n**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**\n\nAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n\n**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**\n\nAn attacker could exploit the vulnerability by hosting a specially crafted Web site that is designed to invoke MSXML through Internet Explorer. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.\n\n**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**\n\nThis vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and visits a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.\n\n**What does the update do?**\n\nThe update removes the vulnerability by ensuring that XML content is parsed correctly.\n\n**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**\n\nYes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2007-0099](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0099).\n\n**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**\n\nNo. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.\n```",
