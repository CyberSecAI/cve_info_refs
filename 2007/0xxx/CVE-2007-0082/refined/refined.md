{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of uploaded file names and types. The script uses the current time combined with the original file name to generate a new file name, and it only checks the mime type for image files. However, it does not properly filter the file extension, allowing an attacker to upload PHP files with double extensions (e.g., `hauru.jpg.png.php`).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Inadequate file name validation",
    "Insufficient mime type checking",
    "Double extension bypass",
    "Arbitrary file upload"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to complete system compromise. This can allow for defacement, data theft, or further attacks on other systems connected to the vulnerable host.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a web-based file upload form that allows users to upload image files. By crafting a file with a double extension (e.g., `hauru.jpg.png.php`), an attacker can bypass the file type checks and upload a malicious PHP script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application's file upload form and have the ability to upload a crafted file. An attacker must also know the session ID of an authenticated user, or be logged in as an authenticated user."
