Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2007-0936:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability exists because Microsoft Visio incorrectly handles the parsing of packed objects within the Visio file format. This leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper handling of packed objects in Visio files.
- Memory corruption due to incorrect parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to take complete control of the affected system.
- An attacker can then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
- Users with fewer user rights may be less impacted but are still vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Email:** An attacker can send a specially crafted Visio file as an email attachment and convince the user to open it.
- **Web-based:** An attacker can host a website containing a malicious Visio file or embed it into a compromised website.  The attacker would need to persuade the user to visit the site (e.g., by clicking a link).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Ability to create a specially crafted Visio file (.VSD, .VSS, or .VST).
- Ability to deliver the crafted file to the target user via email or host it on a website.
- Successful exploitation requires user interaction to open the malicious file.
