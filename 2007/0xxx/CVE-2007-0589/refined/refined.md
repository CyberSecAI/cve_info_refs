Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user input passed through the `user` parameter in `info_user.asp`.
    *   **Weakness:**  Lack of input validation and sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords (as seen in the provided example), or modify data.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  A specially crafted URL with malicious SQL code injected into the `user` parameter of `info_user.asp`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and manipulate URL parameters.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The `busca2.asp` script does not sanitize user-controlled input before reflecting it back in the HTML output. The input is received via the `palavra` parameter via a POST request.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding of user-controlled input enables the injection of client-side scripts.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the webpage, leading to various attacks like session hijacking, cookie theft, and redirection to malicious sites.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `busca2.asp` with malicious JavaScript code in the `palavra` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server and manipulate form parameters.

**Additional Details:**

*   The content explicitly states that the vulnerabilities exist in "Forum Livre 1.0".
*   The identified vulnerabilities are remote, meaning that the attacker doesn't require access to the server machine.
*   The content also provides specific examples of vulnerable URLs and how to trigger both SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.

**CVE Relationship:**

The provided content references both CVE-2007-0590 and CVE-2007-0589. This analysis specifically addresses the vulnerabilities described in the exploit content which aligns with the description of CVE-2007-0589 and it is possible that CVE-2007-0590 relates to another vulnerability within the same application.

**Summary of Vulnerability Information:**

The content describes two distinct vulnerabilities, SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), in the Forum Livre 1.0 application, both resulting from a lack of proper input sanitization. This aligns with the typical description of CVE-2007-0589.
