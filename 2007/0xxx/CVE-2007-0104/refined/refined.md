        "vulnerability": "A vulnerability in poppler which can be exploited by processing a special PDF file has been discovered. The bug can lead to a denial-of-service condition, memory corruption or arbitrary code execution. The issue is tracked by CVE-2007-0104."

        "vulnerability": "The poppler PDF loader library did not limit the recursion depth of the page model tree. By tricking a user into opening a specially crafter PDF file, this could be exploited to trigger an infinite loop and eventually crash an application that uses this library.",

        "vulnerability": "kpdf, the KDE pdf viewer, shares code with xpdf. xpdf contains a vulnerability that can cause denial of service (infinite loop) via a PDF file that contains a crafted catalog dictionary or a crafted Pages attribute that references an invalid page tree node.",

    ],
    "summary": "The vulnerability exists due to a lack of limitation on recursion depth when processing PDF files, which can lead to a denial of service by causing an infinite loop, memory corruption or arbitrary code execution. An attacker can exploit this by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted PDF file.",

      "root_cause": "Insufficient limitation on the recursion depth during the processing of PDF page model trees.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Uncontrolled recursion depth leading to infinite loops.",
        "Lack of proper input validation for crafted PDF files."

      "impact": "Denial of service, memory corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Specially crafted PDF file.",
        "Tricking users to open the malicious PDF file."
