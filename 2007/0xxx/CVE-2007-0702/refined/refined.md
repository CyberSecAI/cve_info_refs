  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes files using a variable ($level) in the include path, without sanitizing this variable, leading to Remote File Inclusion.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The application includes files based on the value of the '$level' variable without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, potentially leading to full system compromise or other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request with a manipulated 'level' parameter in the URL.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and host a malicious file on a server reachable by the vulnerable application."
