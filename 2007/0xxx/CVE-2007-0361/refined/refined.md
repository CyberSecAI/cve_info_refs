{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to an insecure include statement in the `frame.php` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a remote file, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The `chem` parameter in the `frame.php` script is vulnerable, allowing an attacker to specify a URL from which to include a file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server with a crafted `chem` parameter pointing to a malicious remote file."
