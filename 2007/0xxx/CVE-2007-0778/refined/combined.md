Packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 have been updated to correct an
issue which prevented Evolution and other applications linked against the
NSS library from functioning.

[Updated 12 March 2007]
Packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3 have been updated to
correct an issue which prevented Evolution and other applications linked
against the NSS library from functioning.

## Description

SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup
client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

Several flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey processed certain malformed
JavaScript code. A malicious web page could execute JavaScript code in such
a way that may result in SeaMonkey crashing or executing arbitrary code as
the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2007-0775, CVE-2007-0777)

Several cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey
processed certain malformed web pages. A malicious web page could display
misleading information which may result in a user unknowingly divulging
sensitive information such as a password. (CVE-2006-6077, CVE-2007-0995,
CVE-2007-0996)

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey cached web pages on the local disk. A
malicious web page may be able to inject arbitrary HTML into a browsing
session if the user reloads a targeted site. (CVE-2007-0778)

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey displayed certain web content. A
malicious web page could generate content which could overlay user
interface elements such as the hostname and security indicators, tricking a
user into thinking they are visiting a different site. (CVE-2007-0779)

Two flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey displayed blocked popup windows.
If a user can be convinced to open a blocked popup, it is possible to read
arbitrary local files, or conduct an XSS attack against the user.
(CVE-2007-0780, CVE-2007-0800)

Two buffer overflow flaws were found in the Network Security Services (NSS)
code for processing the SSLv2 protocol. Connecting to a malicious secure
web server could cause the execution of arbitrary code as the user running
SeaMonkey. (CVE-2007-0008, CVE-2007-0009)

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled the "location.hostname" value
during certain browser domain checks. This flaw could allow a malicious web
site to set domain cookies for an arbitrary site, or possibly perform an
XSS attack. (CVE-2007-0981)

Users of SeaMonkey are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
contain SeaMonkey version 1.0.8 that corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200703-04**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox, some of
which may allow user-assisted arbitrary remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.0.2** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **1.5.0.10**>= **2.0.0.2** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.0.2** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **1.5.0.10**>= **2.0.0.2** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

### Description

Tom Ferris reported a heap-based buffer overflow involving wide SVG
stroke widths that affects Mozilla Firefox 2 only. Various researchers
reported some errors in the JavaScript engine potentially leading to
memory corruption. Mozilla Firefox also contains minor vulnerabilities
involving cache collision and unsafe pop-up restrictions, filtering or
CSS rendering under certain conditions.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page
that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly leading to the
execution of arbitrary code. It is also possible for an attacker to
spoof the address bar, steal information through cache collision,
bypass the local files protection mechanism with pop-ups, or perform
cross-site scripting attacks, leading to the exposure of sensitive
information, like user credentials.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time for all of these issues, but
most of them can be avoided by disabling JavaScript.

### Resolution

Users upgrading to the following releases of Mozilla Firefox should
note that this upgrade has been found to lose the saved passwords file
in some cases. The saved passwords are encrypted and stored in the
'signons.txt' file of ~/.mozilla/ and we advise our users to save that
file before performing the upgrade.

All Mozilla Firefox 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.10"
```

All Mozilla Firefox 1.5 binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5.0.10"
```

All Mozilla Firefox 2.0 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.2"
```

All Mozilla Firefox 2.0 binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-2.0.0.2"
```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=229805#c0)  Josh Bressers    2007-02-23 16:25:05 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #229802](show_bug.cgi?id=229802 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2007-0775 Multiple Firefox flaws (CVE-2007-0777, CVE-2007-0995, CVE-2007-0996, CVE-2006-6077, CVE-2007-0778, CVE-2007-0779, CVE-2007-0780, CVE-2007-0800, CVE-2007-0008, CVE-2007-0009, CVE-2007-0981)") +++  The Mozilla project is releasing Seamonkey 1.0.8 to fix several flaws:  mfsa2007-01 impact=critical,source=mozilla,reported=20070222,public=20070223      [CVE-2007-0775](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0775)     Jesse Ruderman, Martijn Wargers and Olli Pettay reported crashes in the     layout engine      [CVE-2007-0777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0777)     Brian Crowder, Igor Bukanov, Johnny Stenback, moz_bug_r_a4 and shutdown      reported potential memory corruption in the JavaScript engine  mfsa2007-02 impact=moderate,source=mozilla,reported=20070222,public=20070223      [CVE-2007-0995](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0995)     The Mozilla parser formerly ignored invalid trailing characters in HTML tag      attribute names. This could in some cases be abused to evade web sites      content filters that attempted to remove problematic attributes, such as      event handlers, by matching against a regular expression that expected to      find trailing whitespace or one of a small set of delimiters.      [CVE-2007-0996](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0996)     Stefan Esser demonstrated that this could be used for XSS attacks against     sites that accept user content and do not specify the character set or      encoding used.      [CVE-2006-6077](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-6077)     MySpace users recently suffered a phishing attack where user-created content      included a login form that appeared to be a normal MySpace login, but was      altered to submit the data to an alternate site. Because the password form      appeared on a MySpace page the Firefox password manager filled in the saved      password, lending an air of legitimacy to the form.  mfsa2007-03 impact=moderate,source=mozilla,reported=20070222,public=20070223      [CVE-2007-0778](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0778)     Aad reported that two web pages can collide in the disk cache with the      result that depending on order loaded the end of the longer document can be      appended to the shorter when the shorter is reloaded from the cache. It is      possible a determined hacker could construct a targeted attack to steal some      sensitive data from a particular web page (for example, transaction history      from a financial account). The potential victim would have to be already      logged into the targetted service (or be fooled into doing so) and then      visit the malicious site.  mfsa2007-04 impact=moderate,source=mozilla,reported=20070222,public=20070223      [CVE-2007-0779](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0779)     David Eckel reported that browser UI elements--such as the host name and      security indicators--could be spoofed by using a large, mostly transparent,      custom cursor and adjusting the CSS3 hotspot property so that the visible      part of the cursor floated outside the browser content area.  mfsa2007-05 impact=moderate,source=mozilla,reported=20070222,public=20070223      [CVE-2007-0780](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0780)     shutdown reported that if you could convince a user to open a blocked popup      you could perform a cross-site scripting attack against any site that      contains a frame whose source is a data: URL.      [CVE-2007-0800](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0800)     Michal Zalewski reported that although pages loaded from the web normally      cannot open windows containing local files, if you could convince a user to      open a blocked popup then this restriction could be bypassed.  mfsa2007-06 impact=critical,source=mozilla,reported=20070222,public=20070223      [CVE-2007-0008](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0008) [CVE-2007-0009](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0009)     iDefense has informed Mozilla about two potential buffer overflow      vulnerabilities found by researcher regenrecht in the Network Security      Services (NSS) code for processing the SSLv2 protocol.  mfsa2007-07 impact=moderate,source=mozilla,reported=20070222,public=20070223      [CVE-2007-0981](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0981)     Michal Zalewski demonstrated that setting location.hostname to a value with      embedded null characters can confuse the browsers domain checks. Setting the      value triggers a load, but the networking software reads the hostname only      up to the null character while other checks for "parent domain" start at the      right and so can have a completely different idea of what the current host      is.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=229805#c1)  Josh Bressers    2007-02-23 21:25:27 UTC  ``` These flaws are now public: <http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/known-vulnerabilities.html#firefox1.5.0.10>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=229805#c4)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-02-24 02:59:59 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6
On certain pages, when pressing F5, Firefox adds text from another page (from the cache?) to the end of the current page. Pressing Ctrl-F5 then shows the page as it should be.
This problem does not occur in IE, or when the Firefox cache has been disabled.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to <http://www.oldwings.nl/content/c47_yic/c47x.htm>
2.Then go to <http://www.oldwings.nl/content/c82_yic/c82x.htm>
3.Go to the end of the page, everything is ok.
4.Now press F5 and voila, there is the garbage at the end of the page.
5.Press Ctrl-F5 and the garbage is gone.
Actual Results:
Showed garbage from the previous page after the end of the current page.
Expected Results:
It should not have shown the extra garbage at the end.
I don't know why it is only this particular combination of pages that produces this. It appears to be related to the file name. The problem does NOT occur if you do this:
1.Go to <http://www.oldwings.nl/content/c47_yic/xc47.htm>
2.Then go to <http://www.oldwings.nl/content/c82_yic/xc82.htm>
Pages are identical to the ones mentioned above, only the filename differs.
Trying to disable the browser cache through meta tags does not help, I have yet to try adding HTTP headers.
Also happens in Firefox 1.0.4 and can be reproduced as above. The garbage has also be seen by a friend using the Mozilla suite (version unknown), but it could not be reproduced using the above method.

Correction: I wrote that it also happened in Firefox 1.0.4, this
should have read 1.5.0.4.
Also, I can confirm it is somehow related to the filename.
The problem DOES occur for these name combinations:
c47.htm and c82.htm
c47x.htm and c82x.htm
But it does NOT occur for these combinations:
xc47.htm and xc82.htm
c47.htm and c82a.htm
I have not tried any other combinations.

OK, the pages are back. Just checked using Firefox 1.5.0.7, and the problem still occurs as described. Hopefully someone will pick this up this time.

Martijn, I have no problem keeping these pages available, at least not as long as someone is working on this bug.
One additional bit of info. In [Comment #3](/show_bug.cgi?id=347852#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - reload leaks data from cache to end of page after hash collision in cache") I wrote:
---
The problem DOES occur for these name combinations:
c47.htm and c82.htm
c47x.htm and c82x.htm
But it does NOT occur for these combinations:
xc47.htm and xc82.htm
c47.htm and c82a.htm
---
To avoid any confusion I would like to add that the pages c47, c47x and xc47 are identical, except for their filenames. The same applies to the pages c82, c82x, xc82 and c82a. Therefore this problem appears to be related to the filename, and not to the contents of the page.

Heheh, I'm not sure what's going on down in Necko-cache-land, but I can tell you that both pages are writing to the same file on disk, and it always stays the size of the first page (~24KB) even it's had the second page's contents written to it (which is only the first ~16KB).
NSPR log of cache:5 was utterly useless, as it neglects to mention anything sane.

But we seem to handle those OK in nsDiskCacheDevice::FindEntry and in the nsCacheEntryHashTable ops....
I can't seem to reproduce the garbage; I'll try the assert when I get home, I guess.

OK, I can certainly confirm the assert. The two URLs do in fact hash to the same thing, so we use the same cache entry, which we looks like blow away... but do we never reset the size in the block file or something? I tried tracing the cache code, and I can't see where we actually write out the entry size...
Alfred, biesi, darin do you have time to look at this? You all know this code better than I, I think.
In any case, this looks like a major issue to me, since it allows one site to try to steal another site's data by coming up with URIs that hash to the same thing and having smaller pages. So I think we really want to get this fixed.Severity: normal → criticalStatus: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: trueFlags: blocking1.9?Flags: blocking1.8.1.2?OS: Windows XP → AllHardware: PC → All

Our hash is probably not robust against collision-guessing since it's not intended for anything cryptographic.
Severity possibly "high" assuming collisions are easy to calculate and given that it's easy to refresh a frame. There might be some difference depending on whether one or both of the pages in question get cached to a separate file or to the lumped \_\_CACHE\_00x\_\_ files. In this case they both cache in the file "6EDEB24Ed01". That may limit the minimum size of the attack stub and thus only work against somewhat larger targets. Still, something like an account transaction history page would have a lot of data on it.
Worst-case scenario says "high", but in practice might only be "moderate".Group: securityFlags: blocking1.8.1.1?Keywords: [privacy](/buglist.cgi?keywords=privacy&resolution=---)Summary: On reload/refresh, Firefox adds garbage from cache to the end of page. → reload leaks data from cache to end of page after hash collision in cacheWhiteboard: [sg:high?]

This, of course, a complex problem.
In essence, what happens is that when there is a hash collision there are two objects active within the diskcache system with the same hash key.
Options are:
a. extend hashkey (but still collisions can occur).
b. make cache system collision proof, by allowing multiple entries per hash key (in the 'DiskCacheMap' area)
c. don't store multiple objects in the cache, so when a collision occurs prevent the second entry to be cached (in the disk) at all. (so treat it as 'non-cacheable' because of the collision).
What currently happens is that in FindEntry, the collision is sort of detected because a record for that hash exists, but the matching of the key fails. So FindEntry then just reports not found (by returning null), and then ActiveEntry still creates a new entry (but then that one will end up re-using an diskmap record of another entry). So there we could intervene and refuse to diskcache these kinds of hash collisions...
So, option c is probably "easiest" for a quickfix.
Option b would be better, allowing to also cache hash collisions...Status: NEW → ASSIGNED

Darin, a quick stop to prevent collision issues in the disk cache.
Could take a look and verify if this is a safe way of preventing collisions?

maybe return NS\_ERROR\_CACHE\_IN\_USE instead? or perhaps invent a new error code for this?
also, would be good to file a new bug about implementing a better solution and reference that bug number in this patch.

V2: Use NS\_ERROR\_CACHE\_IN\_USE and diff -u8Np
This is a pretty straightforward merge to branch (just s/strcmp/nsCRT::strcmp/ in a context line in one spot), and should be reasonably safe, I think (though I'd like to let it bake on trunk for a few days).

V2: Use NS\_ERROR\_CACHE\_IN\_USE and diff -u8Np
Moving approvals to the next release. We need more bake time on the Trunk, and with code freeze for 1.8.0.9/1.8.1.1 today, we won't get enough to feel comfortable on the branches.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c0)  Johnny Hughes    2007-02-25 15:49:24 UTC  ``` The seamonkey-1.0.8-x (critical) update prevents evolution from starting.  The following error occurs:  (evolution:32071): evolution-smime-WARNING **: Failed all methods for initializing NSS  Trying to build evolution from the SRPM also does not work as the path for nspr (mozilla 37:1.8) is not the same as the path for nspr (seamonkey 1.0.8).  Using the patch attached to this bug:   <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=202453>  I was able to start Evolution building ... whether it fixes this bug, I will report when it finishes.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c1)  Johnny Hughes    2007-02-25 16:14:17 UTC  ``` rebuilding evolution did not help, the RPM produced built against seamonkey 1.0.8 is identical to the one produced against mozilla   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c2)  Johnny Hughes    2007-02-25 19:50:57 UTC  ``` There is a fix that works as a work around until another solution is done, which list to create this symbolic link:  cd /usr/lib  ln -s firefox-1.5.0.10/libfreeb13.so .  Having libfreeb13.so in /usr/lib allows evolution to start ... removing it prevents it from starting.  This fix is from the centos bugs tracker and mailing list:  <http://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=1694>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c3)  Homayoun Shahri    2007-02-25 21:12:16 UTC  ``` I have exactly the same issue. After the latest rhn update evolution failed to start. I did as suggested by Johnny (thanks), and got evolution to start.  This is very urgent, as I am sure many other people are running into the same issue, and are completely lost as I!     ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c5)  Johnny Hughes    2007-02-26 07:25:08 UTC  ``` OK ... that file name should have a "lowercase L" (l) not a one (1) ...  cd /usr/lib ln -s firefox-1.5.0.10/libfreebl3.so      ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c6)  Mark J. Cox    2007-02-26 11:17:36 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 230048](show_bug.cgi?id=230048 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Latest seamonkey update breaks evolution") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c7)  Mark J. Cox    2007-02-26 11:49:39 UTC  ``` libfreebl3.so is new to NSS3.11 and it is dlopened by libsoftokn3.so.  Therefore the seamonkey-nss library should be shipping libfreebl3.so in /usr/lib (and not in the seamonkey main rpm).  We are therefore respinning seamonkey packages to replace the current erratum packages and will expidite them through QE and release engineering.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c8)  Rik Theys    2007-02-26 13:05:26 UTC  ``` FYI: This bug also breaks gaim   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c10)  RHEL Program Management    2007-02-26 16:24:22 UTC  ``` This bugzilla has Keywords: Regression.    Since no regressions are allowed between releases,  it is also being proposed as a blocker for this release.    Please resolve ASAP.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c14)  Matthew Barnes    2007-02-26 19:39:07 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 230111](show_bug.cgi?id=230111 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - evolution fails initializing NSS") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c16)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-02-26 21:47:22 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0077.html>    ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c19)  Matěj Cepl    2007-03-09 15:27:34 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 230070](show_bug.cgi?id=230070 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Broke NSS ABI - seamonkey security errata") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ``` |  |

# SeaMonkey: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200703-08**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in SeaMonkey, some of which may
allow user-assisted arbitrary remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/seamonkey** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.1** |

| Package | **www-client/seamonkey-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.1** |

### Background

The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver
production-quality releases of code derived from the application
formerly known as the 'Mozilla Application Suite'.

### Description

Tom Ferris reported a heap-based buffer overflow involving wide SVG
stroke widths that affects SeaMonkey. Various researchers reported some
errors in the JavaScript engine potentially leading to memory
corruption. SeaMonkey also contains minor vulnerabilities involving
cache collision and unsafe pop-up restrictions, filtering or CSS
rendering under certain conditions. All those vulnerabilities are the
same as in GLSA 200703-04 affecting Mozilla Firefox.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page or
to read a specially crafted email that will trigger one of the
vulnerabilities, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code.
It is also possible for an attacker to spoof the address bar, steal
information through cache collision, bypass the local file protection
mechanism with pop-ups, or perform cross-site scripting attacks,
leading to the exposure of sensitive information, such as user
credentials.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time for all of these issues, but
most of them can be avoided by disabling JavaScript. Note that the
execution of JavaScript is disabled by default in the SeaMonkey email
client, and enabling it is strongly discouraged.

### Resolution

Users upgrading to the following release of SeaMonkey should note that
the corresponding Mozilla Firefox upgrade has been found to lose the
saved passwords file in some cases. The saved passwords are encrypted
and stored in the 'signons.txt' file of ~/.mozilla/ and we advise our
users to save that file before performing the upgrade.

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-1.1.1"
```

All SeaMonkey binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-bin-1.1.1"
```

Package        : mozilla-firefox
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-1282 CVE-2007-0994 CVE-2007-0995 CVE-2007-0996 CVE-2007-0981 CVE-2007-0008 CVE-2007-0009 CVE-2007-0775 CVE-2007-0778 CVE-2007-0045 CVE-2006-6077

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox.

This will be the last security update of Mozilla-based products for
the oldstable (sarge) distribution of Debian. We recommend to upgrade
to stable (etch) as soon as possible.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:

CVE-2007-1282

    It was discovered that an integer overflow in text/enhanced message
    parsing allows the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0994

    It was discovered that a regression in the Javascript engine allows
    the execution of Javascript with elevated privileges.

CVE-2007-0995

    It was discovered that incorrect parsing of invalid HTML characters
    allows the bypass of content filters.

CVE-2007-0996

    It was discovered that insecure child frame handling allows cross-site
    scripting.

CVE-2007-0981

    It was discovered that Firefox handles URI withs a null byte in the
    hostname insecurely.

CVE-2007-0008

    It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the NSS code allows the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0009

    It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the NSS code allows the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0775

    It was discovered that multiple programming errors in the layout engine
    allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0778

    It was discovered that the page cache calculates hashes in an insecure
    manner.

CVE-2006-6077

    It was discovered that the password manager allows the disclosure of
    passwords.

For the oldstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-2sarge17. You should upgrade to etch as soon as possible.

The stable distribution (etch) isn't affected. These vulnerabilities have
been fixed prior to the release of Debian etch.

The unstable distribution (sid) no longer contains mozilla-firefox. Iceweasel
is already fixed.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2007-03

## Information disclosure through cache collisions

Announced
February 23, 2007
Reporter
Aad
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.5.0.10
* Firefox 2.0.0.2
* SeaMonkey 1.0.8

### Description

**Aad** reported that two web pages can collide in the disk cache
with the result that depending on order loaded the end of the longer
document can be appended to the shorter when the shorter is reloaded from
the cache. It is possible a determined hacker could construct a targeted
attack to steal some sensitive data from a particular web page (for example,
transaction history from a financial account). The potential victim would
have to be already logged into the targeted service (or be fooled into doing
so) and then visit the malicious site.

We have not calculated how much effort would be required to compute a colliding
URL on a different host from the target page.

### Workaround

Temporarily set the disk cache size to zero (0) in the preferences until you can
upgrade to a fixed version.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)

## Details

Several flaws have been found that could be used to perform Cross-site

scripting attacks. A malicious web site could exploit these to modify

the contents or steal confidential data (such as passwords) from other

opened web pages. ([CVE-2006-6077](/security/CVE-2006-6077), [CVE-2007-0780](/security/CVE-2007-0780), [CVE-2007-0800](/security/CVE-2007-0800),

[CVE-2007-0981](/security/CVE-2007-0981), [CVE-2007-0995](/security/CVE-2007-0995), [CVE-2007-0996](/security/CVE-2007-0996))

The SSLv2 protocol support in the NSS library did not sufficiently

check the validity of public keys presented with a SSL certificate. A

malicious SSL web site using SSLv2 could potentially exploit this to

execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. ([CVE-2007-0008](/security/CVE-2007-0008))

The SSLv2 protocol support in the NSS library did not sufficiently

verify the validity of client master keys presented in an SSL client

certificate. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary

code in a server application that uses the NSS library.

([CVE-2007-0009](/security/CVE-2007-0009))

Various flaws have been reported that could allow an attacker to

execute arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into

opening a malicious web page. ([CVE-2007-0775](/security/CVE-2007-0775), [CVE-2007-0776](/security/CVE-2007-0776),

[CVE-2007-0777](/security/CVE-2007-0777), [CVE-2007-1092](/security/CVE-2007-1092))

Two web pages could collide in the disk cache with the result that

depending on order loaded the end of the longer document could be

appended to the shorter when the shorter one was reloaded from the

cache. It is possible a determined hacker could construct a targeted

attack to steal some sensitive data from a particular web page. The

potential victim would have to be already logged into the targeted

service (or be fooled into doing so) and then visit the malicious

site. ([CVE-2007-0778](/security/CVE-2007-0778))

David Eckel reported that browser UI elements--such as the host name

and security indicators--could be spoofed by using custom cursor

images and a specially crafted style sheet. ([CVE-2007-0779](/security/CVE-2007-0779))

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
