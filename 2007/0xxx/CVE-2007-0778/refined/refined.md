  "CVE-2007-0778": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey cached web pages on the local disk. A malicious web page may be able to inject arbitrary HTML into a browsing session if the user reloads a targeted site.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a hash collision in the disk cache where two web pages can be mapped to the same location in the cache. When the browser reloads the second page, the end of the first page, if longer, can get appended to the second page.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient hashing of URLs for caching",
       "Lack of collision resistance in cache implementation"
     ],
    "impact": "A malicious web page could inject arbitrary HTML into a browsing session if the user reloads a targeted site, potentially allowing for sensitive data to be stolen from a legitimate webpage that happens to be loaded after the malicious webpage",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious webpage that triggers a cache collision with a target webpage.",
      "User must visit a malicious site and then reload the targetted site"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a specific web page that collides in the cache with a target site, and then lure the victim into visiting that site, and then later reloading the targetted webpage",
