Hello!
Miniwebsvr 0.0.6 suffers from a directory traversal flaw.
"Exploit" :
http://yoursite/..%00
Attack vector seems limited as you're only able to list one level down.
Cheers,

```
Research: bl4ck
BUGTRAQ:20070211 Miniwebsvr 0.0.6 - Directory traversal

In src/server.c (lines 221-229):

    // Check for sub-root hacking, If found send a forbidden.
    if (strstr(filename,"../")!=NULL)
    {
        strlcat(inst->logbuffer," ;",SERVER_BUFFER_SIZE);
        setHeader_respval(inst,403);  // Forbidden
        printHeader(inst,headeronly,Buffer,SEND_BUFFER_SIZE); // No
need to read

        goto serverquit;
    }

So only a directory traversal of .. will work.
