Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0826:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an SQL injection flaw in the "Ki.isel Site 2007 (tr)" application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `forumid` parameter in the `forum.asp` script is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Disclosure:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code to extract sensitive information from the database. In the provided exploit, the attacker retrieves the username and password of the administrator.
*   **Potential for further exploitation:** Depending on database permissions, the attacker could potentially modify or delete data, or gain deeper access to the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with an SQL injection payload in the `forumid` parameter.
*   **Specific Vulnerable Parameter:** The `forumid` parameter in the `forum.asp` script is the vulnerable entry point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network by sending a malicious HTTP request to the target server.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of HTTP requests and SQL syntax to craft the injection payload.

**Technical Details:**
*  The provided exploit URL is `http://[SITE]/forum.asp?sayfa=konular&forumid=-1%20union+all+select+0,kullaniciadi,2,3,sifre,5,6,7+from+admin`
*   The exploit uses a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to append the admin's username and password from the `admin` table to the query results.
*   The attacker uses `-1` to make the original query return no data and force the application to return results from the injected query only.
