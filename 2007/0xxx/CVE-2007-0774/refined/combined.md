How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  initialization failed. Instead requesting isapi\_redirect.dll
  500 will be returned to the user. This is as closest as it
  can get to Apache Httpd where we refuse to start the server
  in case of fatal initialization errors. (mturk)

  Use initial zero timeout for jk\_is\_socket\_connected. The resulting
  detection is the same but offers a huge performance increase
  with mod\_jk. In most cases the Operating System does not favor
  the 1 microsecond timeout, but it rather rounds that up to much
  higher value (frequency of interrupt timer which on most systems
  defaults to 100Hz).

  Replace APR precompiler directive by httpd mpm\_query to detect MPM threading.
  Add a debug log message about auto-detected pool size. (rjung)
* ![Fix: ](../images/fix.gif)
  Make MMN check easier to understand and a little more precise
  (for new ap\_get\_server\_banner()/ap\_get\_server\_description()).
  We use the new API only for Apache httpd 2.3. This way our binaries are not
  tightly coupled to a minor 2.0 version, and we don't use ap\_get\_server\_banner()
  any way. (rjung)
* ![Fix: ](../images/fix.gif)
  Use the full description string ap\_get\_server\_description() instead of
  the truncated info from ap\_get\_server\_banner(), because this info gets used internally
  (status worker display and ajp14 backend communication) and is not send back to the
  normal user. (rjung)

  [41770](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=41770): Fix the second part of the bug: local\_worker and local\_worker\_only
  is missing from the list of deprecated attributes (and not supported either), so prevents
  the web server from startup. (rjung)

* ![Fix: ](../images/fix.gif)
  Changed the load balancer algorithm.
  The idea behind this new scheduler is the following:
  lbfactor is *how much we expect this worker to work*,
  or *the worker's work quota*.
  lbstatus is *how urgent this worker has to work to fulfill its quota
  of work*. We distribute each worker's work quota to the worker, and then look
  which of them needs to work most urgently (biggest lbstatus). This
  worker is then selected for work, and its lbstatus reduced by the
  total work quota we distributed to all workers. Thus the sum of all
  lbstatus does not change.(\*)
  If some workers are disabled, the others will
  still be scheduled correctly. (mturk)

### JK 2

JK2 has been put in maintainer mode and no further development will take place.
The reason for shutting down JK2 development was the lack of developers interest.
Other reason was lack of users interest in adopting JK2, caused by configuration
complexity when compared to JK.

# Apache JK Tomcat Connector: Remote execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200703-16**

The Apache Tomcat Connector (mod\_jk) contains a buffer overflow
vulnerability that could result in the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apache/mod\_jk** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.21-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.21-r1** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP server is a very widely used web server. mod\_jk
provides the JK module for connecting Tomcat and Apache using the ajp13
protocol.

### Description

ZDI reported an unsafe memory copy in mod\_jk that was discovered by an
anonymous researcher in the map\_uri\_to\_worker function of
native/common/jk\_uri\_worker\_map.c .

### Impact

A remote attacker can send a long URL request to an Apache server using
Tomcat. That can trigger the vulnerability and lead to a stack-based
buffer overflow, which could result in the execution of arbitrary code
with the permissions of the Apache user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache Tomcat users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apache/mod_jk-1.2.21-r1"
```

### Apache Tomcat JK Connectors vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions
of Apache Tomcat Jk Connectors. Each vulnerability is given a
[security impact rating](security-impact.html) by the Apache
Tomcat® security team — please note that this rating may vary from
platform to platform. We also list the versions of Apache Tomcat JK
Connectors the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been
verified list the version with a question mark.

This page has been created from a review of the Apache Tomcat archives
and the CVE list. Please send comments or corrections for these
vulnerabilities to the [Tomcat
Security Team](security.html).

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.50

**Moderate: Information disclosure / Denial of service**
[CVE-2024-46544](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-46544)

Incorrect default permissions for the memory mapped file configured by
the `JkShmFile` directive on Unix like systems allows local
users to view and/or modify the contents of the shared memory containing
mod\_jk configuration and status information. This could result in
information disclosure and/or denial of service.

This was fixed with commit
[d55706e9](https://github.com/apache/tomcat-connectors/commit/d55706e92b65018c2e4c7ab14014a996b0174966).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat Security Team on 6 August 2024.
The issue was made public on 23 September 2024.

Affects: JK 1.2.9-1.2.49 (mod\_jk on Unix like platforms only)

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.49

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2023-41081](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-41081)

In some circumstances, such as when a configuration included
`JkOptions +ForwardDirectories` but the configuration did not
provide explicit mounts for all possible proxied requests, mod\_jk would
use an implicit mapping and map the request to the first defined worker.
Such an implicit mapping could result in the unintended exposure of the
status worker and/or bypass security constraints configured in httpd. As
of JK 1.2.49, the implicit mapping functionality has been removed and all
mappings must now be via explicit configuration. Only mod\_jk is affected
by this issue. The ISAPI redirector is not affected.

This was fixed with commit
[0095b6cb](https://github.com/apache/tomcat-connectors/commit/0095b6cb84f41313ee4c0364b49c766168790792).

This issue was reported to the Tomcat Security Team on 7 July 2023. The
issue was made public on 13 September 2023.

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.48 (mod\_jk only)

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.46

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.45
but the release vote for the 1.2.45 release candidate did not pass.
Therefore, although users must download 1.2.46 to obtain a version that
includes the fix for this issue, version 1.2.45 is not included in the
list of affected versions.*

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2018-11759](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11759)

The Apache Web Server (httpd) specific code that normalised the requested
path before matching it to the URI-worker map did not handle some edge
cases correctly. If only a sub-set of the URLs supported by Tomcat were
exposed via httpd, then it was possible for a specially constructed
request to expose application functionality through the reverse proxy
that was not intended for clients accessing the application via the
reverse proxy. It was also possible in some configurations for a
specially constructed request to bypass the access controls configured in
httpd. While there is some overlap between this issue and CVE-2018-1323,
they are not identical.

This was fixed in revisions [1838836](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1838836),
[1838857](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1838857),

[1841463](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1841463).

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.44

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.43

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2018-1323](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1323)

The IIS/ISAPI specific code that normalised the requested path before
matching it to the URI-worker map did not handle some edge cases
correctly. If only a sub-set of the URLs supported by Tomcat were exposed
via IIS, then it was possible for a specially constructed request to
expose application functionality through the reverse proxy that was not
intended for clients accessing the application via the reverse proxy.

This was fixed in [revision 1825658](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1825658).

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.42

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.42

**Moderate: Buffer Overflow**
[CVE-2016-6808](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6808)

The IIS/ISAPI specific code implements special handling when a virtual
host is present. The virtual host name and the URI are concatenated to
create a virtual host mapping rule. The length checks prior to writing
to the target buffer for this rule did not take account of the length of
the virtual host name, creating the potential for a buffer overflow.

It is not known if this overflow is exploitable.

This was fixed in [revision 1762057](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1762057).

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.41

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.41

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2014-8111](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8111)

Multiple adjacent slashes in a request URI were not collapsed to a single
slash before comparing the request URI to the configured mount and
unmount patterns. It is therefore possible for an attacker to use a
request URI containing multiple adjacent slashes to bypass the
restrictions of a `JkUnmount` directive. This may expose
application functionality through the reverse proxy that is not intended
for clients accessing the application via the reverse proxy.

As of mod\_jk 1.2.41, slashes are collapsed by default. The behaviour is
now configurable via a new `JkOption` for httpd (values
`CollapseSlashesAll`, `CollapseSlashesNone` or
`CollapseSlashesUnmount`) and via a new property
`collapse_slashes` for IIS (values `all`,
`none`, `unmount`).

This was fixed in [revision 1647017](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1647017).

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.40

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.27

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2008-5519](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5519)

Situations where faulty clients set Content-Length without providing
data, or where a user submits repeated requests very quickly, may permit
one user to view the response associated with a different user's request.

This was fixed in [revision 702540](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=702540).

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.26

Source shipped with Tomcat 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.36, 5.0.0-5.0.30,
5.5.0-5.5.27

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.23

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2007-1860](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1860)

The issue is related to
[CVE-2007-0450](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0450), the patch for which was insufficient.

When multiple components (firewalls, caches, proxies and Tomcat)
process a request, the request URL should not get decoded multiple times
in an iterative way by these components. Otherwise it might be possible
to pass access control rules implemented on front of the last component
by applying multiple URL encoding to the request.

mod\_jk before version 1.2.23 by default decoded request URLs inside Apache
httpd and forwarded the encoded URL to Tomcat, which itself did a second
decoding. This made it possible to pass a prefix JkMount for /someapp,
but actually access /otherapp on Tomcat. Starting with version 1.2.23
by default mod\_jk forwards the original unchanged request URL to Tomcat.
You can achieve the same level of security for older versions by setting
the forwarding option "JkOption ForwardURICompatUnparsed".

Please note, that your configuration might contain a different forwarding
JkOption. In this case, please consult the
[forwarding documentation](http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/reference/apache.html#Forwarding) concerning the security implications.
The new default setting is more secure than before, but it breaks
interoperability with mod\_rewrite.

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.22 (httpd mod\_jk module only)

Source shipped with Tomcat 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.36, 5.0.0-5.0.30,
5.5.0-5.5.23

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.21

**Critical: Arbitrary code execution and denial of service**
[CVE-2007-0774](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0774)

An unsafe memory copy in the URI handler for the native JK connector
could result in a stack overflow condition which could be leveraged to
execute arbitrary code or crash the web server.

Affects: JK 1.2.19-1.2.20

Source shipped with: Tomcat 4.1.34, 5.5.20

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.16

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2006-7197](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-7197)

The Tomcat AJP connector contained a bug that sometimes set a too long
length for the chunks delivered by send\_body\_chunks AJP messages. Bugs of
this type can cause mod\_jk to read beyond buffer boundaries and thus
reveal sensitive memory information to a client.

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.15

Source shipped with: Tomcat 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.32, 5.0.0-5.0.30,
5.5.0-5.5.16

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Advisory Details

March 2nd, 2007
## Apache Tomcat JK Web Server Connector Long URL Stack Overflow Vulnerability

### ZDI-07-008ZDI-CAN-152

| CVE ID | [CVE-2007-0774](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0774) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE |  |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Apache |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Tomcat |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['5152']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apache Tomcat JK Web Server Connector. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists in the URI handler for the mod\_jk.so library, map\_uri\_to\_worker(), defined in native/common/jk\_uri\_worker\_map.c. When parsing a long URL request, the URI worker map routine performs an unsafe memory copy. This results in a stack overflow condition which can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Apache has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/miscellaneous/changelog.html> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2007-02-16 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2007-03-02 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
