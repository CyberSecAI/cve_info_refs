- Insufficient input validation for file uploads and parameters.
- Lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution on the server.
- Full compromise of the server running F3Site.
- Ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to data theft, modification, or complete server takeover.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to upload a malicious PHP file named "hauru.php" through the adm.php interface.
- HTTP GET request to execute the uploaded malicious PHP file, providing a command via the "HAURU" header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
