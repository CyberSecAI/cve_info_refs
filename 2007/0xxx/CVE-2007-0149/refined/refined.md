Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0149:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the direct access to the `users.mdb` database file. This file likely contains user credentials (usernames and passwords).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Storage of Credentials:**  Passwords (and possibly other sensitive information) are stored in a database file (`users.mdb`) that is directly accessible via a predictable URL. This is a major security flaw because it bypasses any access control mechanisms.
*   **Direct Access to Database File:** The application fails to protect its data store, allowing unauthorized direct downloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Password Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to user passwords.
*   **Partial Confidentiality Impact:** Sensitive information such as user passwords can be exposed.
*   **Partial Integrity Impact:** With stolen passwords, attackers may be able to modify user data within the system.
*  **Partial Availability Impact**: Compromising user accounts can lead to disruption of service by malicious actors.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** By crafting a specific URL (`http://[target]/[EMembersPro_Path]/users.mdb`), an attacker can download the database file containing user data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any form of authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Target Path:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the installation path of EMembersPro on the target server to construct the vulnerable URL.
