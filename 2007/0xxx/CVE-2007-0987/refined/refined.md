Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-0987

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization of the 'n' parameter in the `index.php` script of Jupiter CMS 1.1.5. The script uses the `n` parameter to include files, and doesn't properly check or sanitize the value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The script's `include()` function is vulnerable to LFI because it includes the provided value of 'n' as file path without proper validation.
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `file_exists()` function in the vulnerable code can be used with URL wrappers allowing for RFI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local File Inclusion:** Allows an attacker to include local files from the server which can lead to sensitive information disclosure, potentially including configuration files, credentials, and even arbitrary code execution if the included file contains PHP code or can lead to code execution via other means.
- **Remote File Inclusion:** Allows an attacker to include remote files from external servers, enabling execution of arbitrary code hosted on the attacker's server, thereby allowing remote takeover of the vulnerable server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `n` parameter in the URL of the `index.php` script.
- LFI is achievable by providing a file path like `/etc/passwd%00`
- RFI is achievable by providing a URL such as `ftp://user:password@example.com/backdoor`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target web server.
- For LFI exploitation: magic_quotes_gpc needs to be off.
- For RFI exploitation: PHP version needs to be >= 5.0.0 and allow_url_fopen needs to be on.

**Additional Details:**
- The `strpos()` function is used but it is insufficient to stop LFI and it doesn't protect from RFI.
- The null byte `%00` is required for LFI if magic_quotes_gpc is off
- `file_exists()` can be used with some URL wrappers, such as ftp://, which enables remote file inclusion.
