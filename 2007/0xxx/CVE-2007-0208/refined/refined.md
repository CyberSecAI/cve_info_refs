    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-0208",
      "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Word. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability results because Word incorrectly checks properties in a modified document, causing it to not prompt the user with a macro security warning when macros are present in the document.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect macro security checks, which bypasses the security warning when a document with macros is opened."

        "Email: Sending a specially crafted Word document with a malicious macro to a user, and persuading the user to open the document.",
