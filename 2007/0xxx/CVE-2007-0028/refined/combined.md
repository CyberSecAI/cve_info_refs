### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves several newly discovered, privately reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in its own subsection in the "Vulnerability Details" section of this bulletin.

An attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Microsoft Excel 2000 | Microsoft Excel 2002 | Microsoft Office Excel 2003 | Microsoft Excel Viewer 2003 | Microsoft Excel 2004 for Mac and Excel v.X for Mac |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Excel Malformed IMDATA Record Vulnerability - [CVE-2007-0027](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0027) | Remote Code Execution | Critical | Important | None | None | Important |
| Excel Malformed Record Vulnerability - [CVE-2007-0028](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0028) | Remote Code Execution | Critical | Important | Important | Important | Important |
| Excel Malformed String Vulnerability - [CVE 2007-0029](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0029) | Remote Code Execution | Critical | Important | Important | Important | Important |
| Excel Malformed Column Record Vulnerability - [CVE-2007-0030](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0029) | Remote Code Execution | Critical | Important | Important | Important | Important |
| Excel Malformed Palette Record Vulnerability - [CVE-2007-0031](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0031) | Remote Code Execution | Critical | Important | Important | None | Important |
| **Aggregate Severity of All Vulnerabilities** |  | **Critical** | **Important** | **Important** | **Important** | **Important** |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Note** The severity ratings for Microsoft Works Suite maps to the Microsoft Excel versions as follows:

The Microsoft Works Suite 2004 and 2005 severity rating is the same as the Microsoft Excel 2002 severity rating.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why did Microsoft reissue this bulletin on January 18, 2007?**

This bulletin has been re-released to re-offer the security update to customers with Microsoft Excel 2000. The security update previously did not correctly process the phonetic information that is embedded in files that are created by using Excel in the Korean, Chinese, or Japanese executable mode. For additional information see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 931183](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/931183).

**What are the known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update?**

[Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 927198](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/927198) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 927198](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/927198).

* [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 931183](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/931183) : Excel 2000 does not open some files after you install security update 925524 that is documented in Microsoft security bulletin MS07-002.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers can install only this update.

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces a prior security update. The security bulletin ID and affected applications are listed in the following table.

| Bulletin ID | Microsoft Excel 2000 | Microsoft Excel 2002 | Microsoft Excel 2003 and Excel Viewer 2003 | Microsoft Excel 2004 for Mac and Excel X for Mac |

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?**

The following table provides the MBSA detection summary for this security update.

| Product | MBSA 1.2.1 | MBSA 2.0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Excel 2000 Service Pack 3 | Yes | No |
| Microsoft Excel 2002 Service Pack 3 | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Excel 2003 Service Pack 2 | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Excel 2004 for Mac | No | No |

## Vulnerability Details

#### Excel Malformed IMDATA Record Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0027:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Excel. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when Excel parses a file and processes a malformed IMDATA record.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for Excel Malformed IMDATA Record Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0027:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Excel file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and Office 2003.

#### Workarounds for Excel Malformed IMDATA Record Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0027:

* Do not open or save Microsoft Excel files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

**Administrative Deployment Information**

To update your administrative installation, follow these steps:

1. [Download the security update for Excel 2003](https://download.microsoft.com/download/f/d/4/fd440961-620a-4e16-a997-190dcf4e0376/office2003-kb925257-fullfile-enu.exe) and/or the [security update for Excel 2003 Viewer](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/9/e/19e98c21-86a6-4fa2-8228-f58de5c229a0/office2003-kb925525-fullfile-enu.exe).
2. Click **Save this program to disk**, and then click **OK**.
3. Click **Save**.
4. Using Windows Explorer, locate the folder that contains the saved file. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type the following command, and then click **OK** to extract the .msp file:
   **[path\name of EXE file] /c /t:C:\AdminUpdate**

   **Note** Double-clicking the .exe file does not extract the .msp file; it applies the update to the local computer. In order to update an administrative image, you must first extract the .msp file.
5. Click **Yes** to accept the License Agreement.
6. Click **Yes** if you are prompted to create the folder.
7. If you are familiar with the procedure for updating **your** administrative installation,click **Start**, click **Run**, type the following command, and then click **OK**:
   **msiexec /a** *Admin Path*\*\*\\*\*MSI File \*\*/p C:\adminUpdate\\*\**MSP File* **SHORTFILENAMES=TRUE**

   **Note** *Admin Path* is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\Office2003), *MSI File* is the .msi database package for the application (for example, Data1.msi), and *MSP File* is the name of the administrative update (for example, SHAREDff.msp).

   **Note** You can append /**qb+** to the command line so that the **Administrative Installation** dialog box and the **End User License Agreement** dialog box do not appear.
8. Click **Next** in the provided dialog box. Do not change your CD key, installation location, or company name in the provided dialog box.
9. Click **I accept the terms in the License Agreement**, and then click **Install**.

At this point, your administrative installation point is updated. Next, you must update the workstations configurations that were originally installed from this administrative installation. To do this, please review the âWorkstation Deployment Informationâ section. Any new installations that you run from this administrative installation point will include the update.

**Warning** Any workstation configuration that was originally installed from this administrative installation before you installed the update cannot use this administrative installation for actions such as repairing Office or adding new features until you complete the steps in the âWorkstation Deployment Informationâ section.

**Workstation Deployment Information**

To deploy the update to the client workstations, click **Start**, click **Run**, type the following command, and then click **OK**:

**Msiexec /I** *Admin Path*\*\*\\*\*MSI File \*\*/qb REINSTALL=\*\*Feature List **REINSTALLMODE=vomu**

**Note** *Admin Path* is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\Office2003), *MSI File* is the .msi database package for the application (for example, Data1.msi), and *Feature List* is the list of feature names (case sensitive) that must be reinstalled for the update.

To install all features, you can use **REINSTALL=ALL** or you can install the following features:

| Product | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| STD11, BASIC11, PERS11, PROI11, PRO11, STDP11, EXCEL11, PRO11SB | ALL |
| XLVIEW | ExcelViewer |

**Note** Administrators working in managed environments can find complete resources for deploying Office updates in an organization on the [Office Admin Update Center](https://office.microsoft.com/fx011511561033.aspx). On the home page of that site, look under the **Update Strategies** section for the software version you are updating. The [Windows Installer Documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21685) also provides more information about the parameters supported by the Windows Installer.

## Microsoft Excel vulnerable to arbitrary code execution via malformed record

#### Vulnerability Note VU#493185

Original Release Date: 2007-01-09 | Last Revised: 2007-01-26

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in Microsoft Excel may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| A vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Excel handles malformed records.  Per Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-002](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS07-002.mspx):*A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Excel. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when Excel parses a file and processes a malformed record.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**Microsoft has issued an update to address this issue. See Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-002](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS07-002.mspx) for more details.Note that Microsoft has re-released the updates in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-002](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS07-002.mspx) for Excel 2000. See the Microsoft Security Response Center [blog](http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2007/01/18/re-release-of-ms07-002-for-excel-2000.aspx) for more information. |
| --- |

| **Do not open untrusted Excel documents**Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected Excel or other Office documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip [ST04-010](http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-010.html).**Do not rely on file name extension filtering**In most cases, Windows will call Excel to open a document even if the document has an unknown file extension. For example, if spreadsheet.qwer contains the correct file header information, Windows will open spreadsheet.qwer with Excel. Filtering for common extensions (e.g., .xls, .xlt, .csv) will not detect all Excel documents. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
