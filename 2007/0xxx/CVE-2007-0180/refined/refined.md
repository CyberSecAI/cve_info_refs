{
  "CVE-2007-0180": {
    "Description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in EF Commander when constructing the full pathname of a file within an ISO image. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow and allows execution of arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a stack-based buffer overflow when EF Commander constructs the full pathname of a file within an ISO image.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code on the target system.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting a malicious ISO image with a deeply nested directory structure. The user must then be convinced to open this ISO file with EF Commander.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious ISO file and convince the victim to open it in EF Commander."
