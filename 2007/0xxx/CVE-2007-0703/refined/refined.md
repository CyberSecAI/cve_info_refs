```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `StageLoader.php` script in WebBuilder <= 2.0 includes a file based on a user-controlled variable, specifically the `GLOBALS[core][module_path]` parameter.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The vulnerability stems from the use of `require_once()` with a path derived from user-supplied input.
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution on the server by including a malicious file from a remote location.
- Attack vectors: Sending a crafted HTTP request to `StageLoader.php` with a modified `GLOBALS[core][module_path]` parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WebBuilder application, specifically the `StageLoader.php` file.
