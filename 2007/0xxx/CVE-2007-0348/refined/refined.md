{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Stack buffer overflows in the ApplicationType property of multiple ActiveX controls provided by InterActual Player.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities in multiple ActiveX controls.",
        "Lack of proper input validation when handling the ApplicationType property in the ActiveX controls."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the user, or cause the web browser to crash.",
  "Attack vectors": [
        "Viewing a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., web page, HTML email, HTML email attachment).",
        "The attack vector is through Internet Explorer due to the ActiveX controls being exploited."

  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create and deliver a malicious HTML document and convince the victim to view it using a vulnerable version of InterActual Player. No special privileges are needed, just user interaction."
