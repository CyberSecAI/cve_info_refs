  "CVE-2007-0066": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Windows kernel performs insufficient validation when processing fragmented router advertisement ICMP packets.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A denial of service vulnerability exists in TCP/IP due to the way that Windows Kernel processes fragmented router advertisement ICMP queries.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could exploit the vulnerability to cause the affected system to stop responding and require the system to restart, resulting in denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "An anonymous attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted ICMP packets to a computer over the network.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted ICMP packets over the network. Router Discovery Protocol (RDP) must be enabled on the target system for the vulnerability to be exploitable."
