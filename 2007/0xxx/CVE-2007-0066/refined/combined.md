How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Windows Kernel TCP/IP/IGMPv3 and MLDv2 Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0069

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows kernel due to the way that the Windows kernel handles TCP/IP structures storing the state of IGMPv3 and MLDv2 queries. Supported editions of Microsoft Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista all support IGMPv3. In addition to IGMPv3, Windows Vista supports MDLv2, which adds multicast support for IPv6 networks. An anonymous attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted IGMPv3 and MLDv2 packets to a computer over the network. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-0069](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0069).

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Kernel TCP/IP/IGMPv3 and MLDv2 Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0069

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. Perimeter firewalls that block multicast traffic (IGMPv3 and MLDv2 specifically) help protect internal network assets from this attack that originate outside of the enterprise perimeter.
* Microsoft Windows 2000 is not affected by this vulnerability.
* Windows Server 2003 by default does not have any multicast addresses active and would not be affected by this vulnerability. However, installing applications that use multicasting could cause the operating system to become vulnerable.
* Attacks attempting to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in a denial of service condition. However remote code execution could be possible.

#### Workarounds for Windows Kernel TCP/IP/IGMPv3 and MLDv2 Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0069

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality.

* **Disable IGMP and MLD processing**

  You can help prevent attempts to exploit the IGMP vulnerability by modifying the IGMPLevel control in the registry.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  **Note** We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.

  To disable IGMP and MLD processing, following these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedit** and then click **OK**.
  2. Expand **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE**.
  3. Expand **SYSTEM**, expand **CurrentControlSe**t, and then expand **Services**.
  4. Expand **TCPIP**, expand **Parameters**, and then expand **IGMPLevel**.
  5. Change the **DWORD** value to 0.

  **Note** You must restart the system for your changes to take effect.

  **Impact of workaround:** IGMPv3 and MLDv2 will be disabled. Applications that depend on this service will no longer function as designed.

  **How to undo the workaround:** Use the steps above to set the registry key setting to its original value or delete this registry key setting. By default this registry key setting is not present.
* **Block IGMP and MLD on perimeter firewalls**

  Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from IGMP and MLD attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter.

  **Impact of workaround:** IGMPv3 and MLDv2 will be blocked from outside the enterprise perimeter, and applications that depend on IGMPv3 and MLDv2 from outside the enterprise perimeter will no longer function as designed.
* **Block IGMP and MLD inbound on Vista Firewall**

  Click **Control Panel**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then double-click **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security**.

  To Block IGMP:

  1. Select **inbound rules**.
  2. Select **Core Networking - Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP-In).**
  3. Right-click **select properties.**
  4. Select **Block the connections**.

  To Block MLD:

  1. Select **inbound rules**.
  2. Select **Core Networking - Multicast Listener Query (ICMPv6-In)**.
  3. Right-click **select properties**.
  4. Select **Block the connections**.
* **Impact of workaround:** IGMP/MLD will be blocked and applications or services that rely on multicast will no longer function.

  **How to undo the workaround:** Use the first three steps above and select **Allow the connections**.

#### FAQ for Windows Kernel TCP/IP/IGMPv3 and MLDv2 Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0069

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated privileges on vulnerable systems. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Windows kernel performs insufficient validation when storing the state of IGMP requests processed by TCP/IP.

**What is TCP/IP?**

TCP/IP is the suite of communications protocols used for transmitting data over networks.

**Why is the vulnerability rating different for Windows Small Business Server and Windows Home Server than Windows Server 2003?**

Windows Server 2003 by default does not have IGMP active and therefore is less exposed to this vulnerability. However, Windows Small Business Server 2003 and Windows Home Server have IGMP active by default, resulting in an increased risk to this vulnerability. The increased risk merits a severity rating of Critical for Windows Small Business Server 2003 and Windows Home Server. We recommend that customers with these products install this update immediately.

**What is IGMP?**

Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is used for IPv4 multicast. A multicast is communication between a single sender and multiple receivers on a network. IGMP is used to exchange membership status data between IPv4 routers that support multicasting and members of multicast groups. See the MSDN site for more information on IGMP.

**What is MLD?**

Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) enables you to manage subnet multicast membership for IPv6. MLD is a series of three Internet Control Message Protocols for IPv6 (ICMPv6) messages that replaces the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) that is used for IPv4. See the MSDN site for more information on [MLD](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms882958.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating specially crafted network packets and sending the packets to an affected system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Client systems are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. However, any systems that use multicasting could be affected by this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Windows kernel processes TCP/IP structures that contain IGMP requests.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued. This security bulletin addresses the privately disclosed vulnerability as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations.

## Windows Kernel TCP/IP/ICMP Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0066

A denial of service vulnerability exists in TCP/IP due to the way that Windows Kernel processes fragmented router advertisement ICMP queries. ICMP Router Discovery Protocol (RDP) is not enabled by default and is required in order to exploit this vulnerability. However, on Windows 2003 Server and on Windows XP, RDP can be turned on by a setting in DHCP or by a setting in the registry. On Windows 2000, RDP can be turned on by a setting in the registry. An anonymous attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted ICMP packets to a computer over the network. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the computer to stop responding and automatically restart.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-0066](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0066).

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

  **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the Search Results pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?, /h, /help** | Displays help on supported switches. |
| **/quiet** | Suppresses the display of status or error messages. |
| **/norestart** | When combined with /quiet, the system will not be restarted after installation even if a restart is required to complete installation. |

**Note** For more information about the wusa.exe installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 934307](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/934307).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the Search Results pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
