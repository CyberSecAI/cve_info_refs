How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : openoffice.org
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2007-0002 CVE-2007-0238 CVE-2007-0239

Several security related problems have been discovered in
OpenOffice.org, the free office suite.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-0002

    iDefense reported several integer overflow bugs in libwpd, a
    library for handling WordPerfect documents that is included in
    OpenOffice.org.  Attackers are able to exploit these with
    carefully crafted WordPerfect files that could cause an
    application linked with libwpd to crash or possibly execute
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0238

    Next Generation Security discovered that the StarCalc parser in
    OpenOffice.org contains an easily exploitable stack overflow that
    could be used exploited by a specially crafted document to execute
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0239

    It has been reported that OpenOffice.org does not escape shell
    meta characters and is hence vulnerable to execute arbitrary shell
    commands via a specially crafted document after the user clicked
    to a prepared link.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.3-9sarge6.

For the testing distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.4.dfsg.2-6.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.4.dfsg.2-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your OpenOffice.org packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# OpenOffice.org: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200704-12**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenOffice.org, allowing
for remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-office/openoffice** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.1.0-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.1.0-r1** |

| Package | **app-office/openoffice-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.2.0** |

### Background

OpenOffice.org is an open source office productivity suite, including
word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, drawing, data charting,
formula editing, and file conversion facilities.

### Description

John Heasman of NGSSoftware has discovered a stack-based buffer
overflow in the StarCalc parser and an input validation error when
processing metacharacters in a link. Also OpenOffice.Org includes code
from libwpd making it vulnerable to heap-based overflows when
converting WordPerfect document tables (GLSA 200704-07).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
document, possibly leading to execution of arbitrary code with the
rights of the user running OpenOffice.org.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenOffice.org users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-2.1.0-r1"
```

All OpenOffice.org binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-2.2.0"
```

# libwpd: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200704-07**

libwpd is vulnerable to several heap overflows and an integer overflow.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/libwpd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.8.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.8.9** |

### Background

libwpd is a library used to convert Wordperfect documents into other
formats.

### Description

libwpd contains heap-based overflows in two functions that convert
WordPerfect document tables. In addition, it contains an integer
overflow in a text-conversion function.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to convert a specially crafted
WordPerfect file, resulting in a crash or possibly the execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running libwpd.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libwpd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/libwpd-0.8.9"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
