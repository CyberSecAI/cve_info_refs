  "CVE-2007-0812": [
    {
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_550b6f15_20250124_115125.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is in pms.php, specifically within the handling of the 'pmid' parameter in the 'delmark' action. The application uses `addslashes()` on the `pmid` parameter before inserting it into an SQL query, but it does not enclose the parameter in quotes. This allows for SQL injection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL injection vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization and lack of proper quoting."
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to: Disclosure of sensitive data, such as admin credentials (username/MD5 hash); Modification or deletion of private messages; Possible full database compromise if the application user has sufficient privileges.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP POST request to `pms.php` with the `action` parameter set to `delmark` and crafted `pmid` parameters."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to have valid user credentials in the vulnerable application and knowledge of the vulnerable parameter. The attacker also needs to send a specially crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker can be on the same network, or a remote attacker if the application is exposed to the internet."
