**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Heap-based buffer overflow in SVG rendering (specifically related to stroke widths).
*   Memory corruption issues within the JavaScript engine.
*   Cache collision vulnerabilities.
*   Unsafe pop-up restrictions.
*   Issues in filtering.
*   Issues in CSS rendering under certain conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By enticing a user to visit a specially crafted webpage or view a crafted email, attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code on the user's system.
*   **Spoofing:** Attackers could spoof the browser's address bar.
*   **Information Stealing:** Sensitive information, including user credentials, could be stolen through cache collisions.
*   **Local File Bypass:** Attackers could bypass local file protection mechanisms via pop-up vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Pages:** Maliciously crafted web pages could trigger the vulnerabilities when viewed by a victim.
*   **Emails:** Specially crafted emails could trigger the vulnerabilities, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution when viewed by the victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver the specially crafted content to the user, such as by hosting a malicious web page or sending a malicious email.
*   No special user privileges or access to the victim's system is necessary other than the ability to make the user view the malicious content with the vulnerable browser.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided content from Gentoo indicates that the same set of vulnerabilities affects both Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey.
