How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200703-04**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox, some of
which may allow user-assisted arbitrary remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.0.2** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **1.5.0.10**>= **2.0.0.2** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.0.2** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **1.5.0.10**>= **2.0.0.2** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

### Description

Tom Ferris reported a heap-based buffer overflow involving wide SVG
stroke widths that affects Mozilla Firefox 2 only. Various researchers
reported some errors in the JavaScript engine potentially leading to
memory corruption. Mozilla Firefox also contains minor vulnerabilities
involving cache collision and unsafe pop-up restrictions, filtering or
CSS rendering under certain conditions.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page
that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly leading to the
execution of arbitrary code. It is also possible for an attacker to
spoof the address bar, steal information through cache collision,
bypass the local files protection mechanism with pop-ups, or perform
cross-site scripting attacks, leading to the exposure of sensitive
information, like user credentials.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time for all of these issues, but
most of them can be avoided by disabling JavaScript.

### Resolution

Users upgrading to the following releases of Mozilla Firefox should
note that this upgrade has been found to lose the saved passwords file
in some cases. The saved passwords are encrypted and stored in the
'signons.txt' file of ~/.mozilla/ and we advise our users to save that
file before performing the upgrade.

All Mozilla Firefox 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.10"
```

All Mozilla Firefox 1.5 binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5.0.10"
```

All Mozilla Firefox 2.0 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.2"
```

All Mozilla Firefox 2.0 binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-2.0.0.2"
```

# SeaMonkey: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200703-08**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in SeaMonkey, some of which may
allow user-assisted arbitrary remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/seamonkey** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.1** |

| Package | **www-client/seamonkey-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.1** |

### Background

The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver
production-quality releases of code derived from the application
formerly known as the 'Mozilla Application Suite'.

### Description

Tom Ferris reported a heap-based buffer overflow involving wide SVG
stroke widths that affects SeaMonkey. Various researchers reported some
errors in the JavaScript engine potentially leading to memory
corruption. SeaMonkey also contains minor vulnerabilities involving
cache collision and unsafe pop-up restrictions, filtering or CSS
rendering under certain conditions. All those vulnerabilities are the
same as in GLSA 200703-04 affecting Mozilla Firefox.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page or
to read a specially crafted email that will trigger one of the
vulnerabilities, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code.
It is also possible for an attacker to spoof the address bar, steal
information through cache collision, bypass the local file protection
mechanism with pop-ups, or perform cross-site scripting attacks,
leading to the exposure of sensitive information, such as user
credentials.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time for all of these issues, but
most of them can be avoided by disabling JavaScript. Note that the
execution of JavaScript is disabled by default in the SeaMonkey email
client, and enabling it is strongly discouraged.

### Resolution

Users upgrading to the following release of SeaMonkey should note that
the corresponding Mozilla Firefox upgrade has been found to lose the
saved passwords file in some cases. The saved passwords are encrypted
and stored in the 'signons.txt' file of ~/.mozilla/ and we advise our
users to save that file before performing the upgrade.

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-1.1.1"
```

All SeaMonkey binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-bin-1.1.1"
```
