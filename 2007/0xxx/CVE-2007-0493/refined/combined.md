		   BIND 9: dereferencing freed fetch context
                             12 January 2007

Versions affected:

	BIND 9.3.0, 9.3.1, 9.3.2, 9.3.3
        BIND 9.4.0a1, 9.4.0a2, 9.4.0a3, 9.4.0a4, 9.4.0a5, 9.4.0a6, 9.4.0b1
	     9.4.0b2, 9.4.0b3, 9.4.0b4, 9.4.0rc1
	BIND 9.5.0a1 (Bind Forum only)

Severity: Low
Exploitable: Remotely

Description:

	It is possible for the named to dereference (read) a freed
	fetch context.  This can cause named to exit unintentionally.

Workaround:

	Disable / restrict recursion (to limit exposure).

Fix:

	Upgrade to BIND 9.2.8, BIND 9.3.4 or BIND 9.4.0rc2.
	Additionally this will be fixed in the upcoming BIND 9.5.0a2.

Versions of bind-9.2.x older than bind-9.2.8, and versions of bind-9.3.x older than 9.3.4 can be made to crash with malformed local or remote data.  More details about the issues may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0493   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0494  Here are the details from the Slackware 11.0 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/bind-9.3.4-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:   Upgraded to bind-9.3.4.

FreeBSD-SA-07:02.bind Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities in named(8)
Category: contrib
Module: bind
Announced: 2007-02-09
Affects: FreeBSD 5.3 and later.
Corrected: 2007-02-07 00:42:09 UTC (RELENG\_6, 6.2-STABLE)
2007-02-09 20:24:15 UTC (RELENG\_6\_2, 6.2-RELEASE-p1)
2007-02-09 20:23:29 UTC (RELENG\_6\_1, 6.1-RELEASE-p13)
2007-02-07 00:46:35 UTC (RELENG\_5, 5.5-STABLE)
2007-02-09 20:22:44 UTC (RELENG\_5\_5, 5.5-RELEASE-p11)
CVE Name: CVE-2007-0493, CVE-2007-0494
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
BIND 9 is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols.
The named(8) daemon is an Internet domain name server. DNS Security
Extensions (DNSSEC) are additional protocol options that add
authentication and integrity to the DNS protocols.
II. Problem Description
A type \* (ANY) query response containing multiple RRsets can trigger an
assertion failure.
Certain recursive queries can cause the nameserver to crash by using memory
which has already been freed.
III. Impact
A remote attacker sending a type \* (ANY) query to an authoritative DNS
server for a DNSSEC signed zone can cause the named(8) daemon to exit,
resulting in a Denial of Service.
A remote attacker sending recursive queries can cause the nameserver to
crash, resulting in a Denial of Service.
IV. Workaround
There is no workaround available, but systems which are not authoritative
servers for DNSSEC signed zones are not affected by the first issue; and
systems which do not permit untrusted users to perform recursive DNS
resolution are not affected by the second issue. Note that the default
configuration for named(8) in FreeBSD allows local access only (which on
many systems is equivalent to refusing access to untrusted users).
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 5-STABLE, or 6-STABLE, or to the
RELENG\_6\_2, RELENG\_6\_1, or RELENG\_5\_5 security branch dated after the
correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 5.5, 6.1,
and 6.2 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

Abstract
========
Two denial of service vulnerabilities have been reported in bind which
can cause the name server daemon to crash. The vulnerabilities relate
to the processing of type \* (ANY) queries and recursive queries.
The ANY query processing issue has been assigned CVE reference CVE-2007-0493.
The recursive query issue has been assigned CVE reference CVE-2007-0494.
Technical Details
=================
Issue #1: \* (ANY) query processing
This issue is relating to the way in which the server processes
a type \* (ANY) query. In order for this attack to be successful
the query must return multiple RRsets in the answer section. In
addition to this the server must be configured with dnssec
validation enabled.
Issue #2: Recursive query handling
This issue is relating to the way in which the server processes
recursive queries. The request, in this case, can cause named to
read a freed fetch context. The server needs to be enabled to
receive recursive queries in order for this attack to be successful.
Solutions and Workarounds
=========================
If you have not enabled dnssec validation in your name server then you
are not vulnerable to the \* (ANY) denial of service attack. Both
vulnerabilities can be mitigated by limiting who can perform specific
queries against the name server.
In particular, it is recommended practice, regardless of this
vulnerability, to accept recursive queries only from local clients who
would be expected to query this nameserver directly, not from unknown
Internet sources. The 'allow-recursion' directive in the options
section of named.conf should be configured with an appropriate address
list, as in the following simple example:
options {
directory "/etc/namedb";
allow-recursion { 1.2.3.4/24; 127.0.0.1/32; ::1; };
};
It is recommended that NetBSD users of vulnerable versions update
their binaries.
The following instructions describe how to upgrade your bind
binaries by updating your source tree and rebuilding and
installing a new version of bind.
\* NetBSD-current:
Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2007-01-27
should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2007-01-28 or later.
Due to the amount of changes introduced in the BIND upgrade
in CVS HEAD it is recommended that users of NetBSD-current
perform a full system upgrade to sources dated after 2007-01-28.
For more information on how to do this, see:
http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/current/
\* NetBSD 3.\*:
Systems running NetBSD 3.\* sources dated from before
2007-03-04 should be upgraded from NetBSD 3.\* sources dated
2007-03-05 or later.
The following files need to be updated from the
netbsd-3 or netbsd-3-1 branch:
dist/bind/lib/dns/resolver.c
dist/bind/lib/dns/validator.c
dist/bind/lib/dns/include/dns/validator.h
dist/bind/version
To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install bind:
# cd src
# cvs update -r  dist/bind/lib/dns/resolver.c
# cvs update -r  dist/bind/lib/dns/validator.c
# cvs update -r  \
dist/bind/lib/dns/include/dns/validator.h
# cvs update -r  dist/bind/version
# cd usr.sbin/bind
# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
# make USETOOLS=no install
The following directories need to be updated from the
netbsd-3-0 branch:
dist/bind
usr.sbin/bind
To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install bind:
# cd src
# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-3-0 dist/bind
# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-3-0 usr.sbin/bind
# cd usr.sbin/bind
# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
# make USETOOLS=no install
Thanks To
=========
The Internet Software Consortium is credited with the discovery and
correction of both issues.

# BIND: Denial of service — GLSA **200702-06**

ISC BIND contains two vulnerabilities allowing a Denial of Service under
certain conditions.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-dns/bind** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **9.3.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **9.3.4**revision >= **9.2.8** |

### Background

ISC BIND is the Internet Systems Consortium implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocol.

### Description

An unspecified improper usage of an already freed context has been
reported. Additionally, an assertion error could be triggered in the
DNSSEC validation of some responses to type ANY queries with multiple
RRsets.

### Impact

A remote attacker could crash the server through unspecified vectors
or, if DNSSEC validation is enabled, by sending certain crafted ANY
queries.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time for the first issue. The
DNSSEC validation Denial of Service can be prevented by disabling
DNSSEC validation until the upgrade to a fixed version. Note that
DNSSEC validation is disabled on a default configuration.

### Resolution

All ISC BIND 9.3 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/bind-9.3.4"
```

All ISC BIND 9.2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/bind-9.2.8"
```
