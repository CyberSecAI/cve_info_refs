{
  "CVE-2007-0493": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue in ISC BIND. The named daemon can dereference a freed fetch context, leading to a crash. Additionally, a separate vulnerability exists in the DNSSEC validation logic. When processing type ANY queries with multiple RRsets, an assertion failure can be triggered.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of freed memory during fetch operations and a flaw in DNSSEC validation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Assertion failure"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the named daemon. In the DNSSEC validation issue, a crafted ANY query can trigger a crash if DNSSEC validation is enabled.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending crafted recursive DNS queries",
      "Sending crafted type ANY queries with multiple RRsets (if DNSSEC is enabled)"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable name server."
  }
