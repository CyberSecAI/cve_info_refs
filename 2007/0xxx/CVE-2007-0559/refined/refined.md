Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0559:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `config.php` file of RPW version 1.0.2. The code uses `require($sql_language);` where `$sql_language` is taken from user input via the `sql_language` parameter in the URL. This allows an attacker to include a remote file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI due to the unsanitized inclusion of a file specified through user-supplied input (`sql_language` parameter).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Complete compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `config.php` file, providing a malicious URL to include in the `sql_language` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable path:** The attacker must know the path to `config.php` and the existence of the `sql_language` parameter.
- **Ability to host a malicious file:** The attacker needs to host a file containing malicious code which will be included by the vulnerable server.
