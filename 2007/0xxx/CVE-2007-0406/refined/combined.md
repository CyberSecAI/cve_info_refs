Download it from [our download page](/index.php/download). |  | 10.04.2007 | xine-lib 1.1.5 | | --- | --- | | A new xine-lib version is now available. This release contains a security fix ([CVE-2007-1246](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1246)); it also contains XCB support, and has portability fixes for Mac OS X and OpenBSD.

Download it from [our download page](/index.php/download). |  | 03.04.2007 | Mad as a hatter | | --- | --- | | We've switched over from CVS to [Mercurial](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/) for xine-lib and gxine. You can find the new repositories at <http://hg.debian.org/hg/>; their names all begin with xine-lib/.  If you want to access these repositories and are unfamiliar with Mercurial, you should visit [Mercurial's Getting Started section](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/#head-fa3b1ac44fb16c1886b6a5e46254b3874a399a14).  Everything else is still being maintained via CVS. |  | 03.02.2007 | xine-plugin 1.0 | | --- | --- | | This is a media player plugin for Mozilla browsers and other browsers which provide the same plugin interface.  xine-plugin is available from [our download page](/index.php/download) or [directly from Sourceforge](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/xine/xine-plugin-1.0.tar.bz2?download). |  | 01.02.2007 | gxine 0.5.11 | | --- | --- | | This is a bugfix release, fixing some configuration problems which only show up if you use gxine 0.5.10 with GTK+ 2.10 and xine-lib 1.1.4. If you do, you are advised to upgrade.  gxine 0.5.11 is available from [our download page](/index.php/download) or [directly from Sourceforge](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/xine/gxine-0.5.11.tar.bz2?download). |  | 29.01.2007 | xine-lib 1.1.4 | | --- | --- | | A new xine-lib version is now available. This release fixes some important issues that have "bugged" us for quite some time.  Please check the [release notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=482174) for details.  Download it from [our download page](/index.php/download). |  | 08.01.2007 | gxine 0.5.10 | | --- | --- | | **This release fixes a security bug (possible local exploit). If you are using any older version, you are advised to upgrade to this version or a suitably-patched version supplied by your chosen distribution.**  Other than that, just a few miscellaneous fixes...  gxine 0.5.10 is available from [our download page](/index.php/download) or [directly from Sourceforge](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/xine/gxine-0.5.10.tar.bz2?download). |  | 17.12.2006 | gxine 0.5.9 | | --- | --- | | New features: prevent screen blanking in windowed mode; show time remaining; include a JPEG version of the logo for when distributors are scared to include MPEG codecs in xine-lib. gxine also now knows about xscreensaver.  And some minor fixes. Nothing significant :-)  gxine 0.5.9 is available from [our download page](/index.php/download) or [directly from Sourceforge](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/xine/gxine-0.5.9.tar.bz2?download). |  | 03.12.2006 | xine-lib 1.1.3 | | --- | --- | | xine-lib version 1.1.3 is now available for download. This release contains several bug and security fixes.  Please take a minute to read the [release notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=468432).  Download it from [our download page](/index.php/download). |  | 07.10.2006 | gxine 0.5.8 | | --- | --- | | Another maintenance release - the usual collection of fixes and minor new stuff (in particular, an eject() command).  gxine 0.5.8 is available from [our download page](/index.php/download) or [directly from Sourceforge](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/xine/gxine-0.5.8.tar.bz2?download). | |
