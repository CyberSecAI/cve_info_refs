  "CVE-2007-0577": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes files based on a user-supplied 'path' parameter without proper sanitization.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI).",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to complete system compromise, code execution, data theft, etc.",
      "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'path' parameter in the URL, the attacker can point to a malicious file hosted on a remote server.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application with the manipulated 'path' parameter. The attacker also needs to host a malicious file on a server accessible to the vulnerable application."
