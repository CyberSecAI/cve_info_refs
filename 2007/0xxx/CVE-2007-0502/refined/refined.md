Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-0502

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection in the `gallery.php` file of webSPELL version 4.01.02.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The `gallery.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection. The vulnerability is "blind" because the attacker doesn't directly see the results of the query, but they can infer them based on the response. This specific vulnerability uses the `MID` function to extract single characters of the user's password, comparing it to each character in a bruteforce manner.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, specifically the MD5 hash of the password for a given user ID.
- **Potential Account Compromise:** By obtaining the password hash, an attacker could attempt to crack it and gain unauthorized access to the user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `gallery.php` file. The attacker manipulates the `picID` parameter by injecting a SQL query.
- **URL Parameters:** The vulnerability is triggered using URL parameters `action`, `galleryID`, and `picID`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques and the structure of the database to properly construct the malicious queries.
- **Target System Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know a valid `galleryID`, `picID` and `userID` to exploit the vulnerability

**Additional Details (from exploit code):**
- The exploit code uses a custom PHP class named `phpsploit` to send the crafted HTTP requests.
- The exploit uses a brute-force technique to extract the password hash character by character by modifying the `picID` url parameter with sql injection.
- The script iterates through characters from 0-9 and a-z to find the correct character for every position of the password's MD5 hash.
- The exploit works regardless of PHP security settings such as `magic_quotes` and `register_globals`.
- The code provides usage examples, including the option to use a proxy server.
- It includes a Google dork to find potentially vulnerable webspell sites.
