Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the SQL Injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the SQL queries. Specifically, the application directly concatenates user-provided parameters from HTTP requests (Request("id"), Request("_pass"), Request.Form("User"), Request.Form("Password")) into SQL query strings without any form of escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the `uId`, `_pass`, `User`, and `Password` parameters within the HTTP requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** By injecting SQL code, an attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other user-related data.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data from the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database user's permissions, an attacker might be able to gain access to system-level privileges on the database server.
- **Denial of Service:** It might be possible to cause a denial of service by injecting queries that crash the database or use excessive resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET or POST requests to the vulnerable ASP pages (`user_confirm.asp`, `login.asp`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the application.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker requires a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft malicious injection payloads.

**Vulnerable Code Snippets:**
*   `user_confirm.asp`:
    ```asp
    uId = Request("id")
    sql = "select A.* from x_User A Where A.idUser =" & uId & " AND A.sPassword = '" & Request("_pass") & "'"
    ```
*   `login.asp`:
    ```asp
    sql = "SELECT * FROM tUser WHERE sCode ='" & sUser & "' AND sPassword='" & sPass & "' "
    ```
