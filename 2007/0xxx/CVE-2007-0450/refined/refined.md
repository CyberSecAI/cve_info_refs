  "CVE-2007-0450": {
    "description": "Tomcat permits '\\', '%2F' and '%5C' as path delimiters. When Tomcat is used behind a proxy (including, but not limited to, Apache HTTP server with mod_proxy and mod_jk) configured to only proxy some contexts, a HTTP request containing strings like \"/../\" may allow attackers to work around the context restriction of the proxy, and access the non-proxied contexts.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Tomcat allows '\\', '%2F' and '%5C' as path delimiters in URLs, while some proxies do not, leading to inconsistent interpretation of URLs.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Directory traversal vulnerability",
        "Inconsistent URL handling between Tomcat and proxies"
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers can bypass context restrictions imposed by a proxy server and potentially access restricted content on the Tomcat server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted HTTP request with directory traversal sequences like \"/../\" and/or URL encoded backslashes (%5C)"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to send HTTP requests to a Tomcat server behind a proxy.",
        "Knowledge of the proxy configuration"
      ],
        "additional_notes": "The vulnerability occurs when Tomcat is behind a proxy (such as Apache HTTP server with mod_proxy and mod_jk) and the proxy is configured to only proxy some contexts. Exploitation involves crafting a request containing directory traversal sequences that Tomcat interprets as valid path delimiters while the proxy does not, allowing access to non-proxied contexts."
