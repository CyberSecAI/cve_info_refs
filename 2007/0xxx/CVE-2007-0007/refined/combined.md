| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=223233#c0)  Sami Farin    2007-01-18 16:09:15 UTC  ``` Description of problem: gnucash ignores env vars TMP TMPDIR TEMP TEMPDIR and happily opens with modes O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC (forgets O_EXCL), allowing easy overwrite of gnucash user's files in case of many users on the same system or some evil program having access to /tmp.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 2.0.4-1  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. start gnucash 2. 3.    Actual results: 19621 17:56:45.850053 open("/tmp/gnucash.trace", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_LARGEFILE, 0666) = -1 EISDIR (Is a directory) <0.000034> 19621 17:56:45.850143 open("/tmp/qof.trace", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_LARGEFILE, 0666) = -1 EISDIR (Is a directory) <0.000028> 19621 17:56:45.850271 open("/tmp/qof.trace.19621", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_LARGEFILE, 0666) = 19 <0.000200>   Expected results: using my temp dirs or flag O_EXCL to open().  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=223233#c1)  Josh Bressers    2007-01-18 18:45:18 UTC  ``` I'm giving this [CVE-2007-0007](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-0007).  Sami, do you mind if I share this information with the Vendor Security mailing list?  It is a group of trusted vendors who would appreciate a notification of this flaw.  Additionally do you have a date in mind to make this flaw public?  If you don't care, I'd be happy to work one out with the other affected vendors.  Thanks for the report.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=223233#c2)  Sami Farin    2007-01-18 20:58:13 UTC  ``` You can do the CVE dance and share the info.  You can work out the publication if you want to... but if you forget to do it, I do it on Feb 19 2007.  If you need to use my email, safari-fedora.fi is for that purpose, let's use this bugzilla email for bugzilla.    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=223233#c4)  Josh Bressers    2007-02-19 17:30:11 UTC  ``` This flaw is now public: <http://secunia.com/advisories/24225/>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=223233#c5)  Fedora Update System    2007-02-19 18:41:50 UTC  ``` gnucash-2.0.5-1.fc6 has been pushed for fc6, which should resolve this issue.  If these problems are still present in this version, then please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=223233#c6)  Fedora Update System    2007-02-27 16:49:19 UTC  ``` gnucash-2.0.5-1.fc6 has been pushed for fc6, which should resolve this issue.  If these problems are still present in this version, then please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |
