> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

# USN-473-1: libgd2 vulnerabilities

12 June 2007

libgd2 vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

A buffer overflow was discovered in libgd2's font renderer. By tricking

an application using libgd2 into rendering a specially crafted string

with a JIS encoded font, a remote attacker could read heap memory or

crash the application, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-0455](/security/CVE-2007-0455))

Xavier Roche discovered that libgd2 did not correctly validate PNG

callback results. If an application were tricked into processing a

specially crafted PNG image, it would monopolize CPU resources. Since

libgd2 is often used in PHP and Perl web applications, this could lead

to a remote denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2756](/security/CVE-2007-2756))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 7.04

* libgd2-xpm
  -
  2.0.34~rc1-2ubuntu1.1
* libgd2-noxpm
  -
  2.0.34~rc1-2ubuntu1.1

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* libgd2-xpm
  -
  2.0.33-4ubuntu2.1
* libgd2-noxpm
  -
  2.0.33-4ubuntu2.1

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* libgd2-xpm
  -
  2.0.33-2ubuntu5.2
* libgd2-noxpm
  -
  2.0.33-2ubuntu5.2

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=224607#c0)  Josh Bressers    2007-01-26 17:44:01 UTC  ``` Kees Cook from Ubuntu reported a "off-the-end-of-string increment", which could theoretically lead ot a buffer overflow.  This flaw would only be exploitable if a JIS-encoded font is used when processing a special malicious string.  The issue here is that the NULL terminator is incremented, which could lead to unknown results during the processing of the malicious string.

## Topic

Updated PHP packages that fix several security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
HTTP Web server.

A denial of service flaw was found in the way PHP processed a deeply nested
array. A remote attacker could cause the PHP interpreter to crash by
submitting an input variable with a deeply nested array. (CVE-2007-1285)

A flaw was found in the way PHP's unserialize() function processed data. If
a remote attacker was able to pass arbitrary data to PHP's unserialize()
function, they could possibly execute arbitrary code as the apache user.
(CVE-2007-1286)

A flaw was found in the way the mbstring extension set global variables. A
script which used the mb\_parse\_str() function to set global variables could
be forced to enable the register\_globals configuration option, possibly
resulting in global variable injection. (CVE-2007-1583)

A double free flaw was found in PHP's session\_decode() function. If a
remote attacker was able to pass arbitrary data to PHP's session\_decode()
function, they could possibly execute arbitrary code as the apache user.
(CVE-2007-1711)

A flaw was discovered in the way PHP's mail() function processed header
data. If a script sent mail using a Subject header containing a string from
an untrusted source, a remote attacker could send bulk e-mail to unintended
recipients. (CVE-2007-1718)

A heap based buffer overflow flaw was discovered in PHP's gd extension. A
script that could be forced to process WBMP images from an untrusted source
could result in arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2007-1001)

A buffer over-read flaw was discovered in PHP's gd extension. A script that
could be forced to write arbitrary string using a JIS font from an
untrusted source could cause the PHP interpreter to crash. (CVE-2007-0455)

Users of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages which contain
backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=235028#c0)  Joe Orton    2007-04-03 14:07:49 UTC  ``` Description of problem: An integer overflow exists in the wbmp handling in the copy of the gd library which is bundled in the "gd" extension:  <http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/ext/gd/libgd/gdhelpers.h?r1=1.2.2.3&r2=1.2.2.3.4.1&diff_format=u>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=235028#c1)  Joe Orton    2007-04-03 14:11:57 UTC  ``` Additionally, per [bug 224607](show_bug.cgi?id=224607 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2007-0455 gd: buffer overrun"), Kees Cook from Ubuntu reported a "off-the-end-of-string increment", which could theoretically lead ot a buffer overflow.  This flaw would only be exploitable if a JIS-encoded font is used when processing a special malicious string.  (CVE-2007-0455; Impact: Low)    ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=235028#c5)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-04-16 15:33:39 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0155.html>    ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
