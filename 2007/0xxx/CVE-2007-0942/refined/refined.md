{
  "CVE-2007-0942": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from the way Internet Explorer instantiates COM objects that are not intended to be instantiated in Internet Explorer.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption during COM object instantiation."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and take complete control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, and creating new accounts with the same user rights as the logged-on user.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A specially crafted webpage that when visited, triggers the vulnerability through Internet Explorer",
          "Maliciously crafted Web sites that accept or host user-provided content.",
          "Compromised Web sites and advertisement servers."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker would need to convince a user to visit the malicious website, typically through a link in an email or instant message. The attacker needs to craft a website that triggers the vulnerability."
  },
  "CVE-2007-0944": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer accessing an object that has not been initialized or has already been deleted.",

      "Uninitialized memory corruption",
        "Use of a deleted object"
    ],
