Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0981:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content includes multiple sources that directly mention and relate to CVE-2007-0981.  Specifically, the bugzilla entries from both Red Hat and Mozilla, along with the Red Hat security advisory and the CERT vulnerability note explicitly name CVE-2007-0981 and describe the vulnerability.  The content from Vupen and the OVH cloud are unrelated.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of this vulnerability is improper handling of null characters within the `location.hostname` property in Mozilla-based browsers.  Specifically, when the location.hostname is set to a string containing embedded null characters, some domain checks are fooled.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   The core vulnerability lies in how the browsers process strings containing null characters, which can result in inconsistencies in how the browser interprets the hostname and thus fails in same origin checks.
    *   The browser reads the hostname up to the null character for some purposes, while other security checks are performed on the full string, which can lead to a mismatch of expectations.
    *   Specifically, the way SeaMonkey handles `location.hostname` value during certain browser domain checks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can use this flaw to set domain cookies for arbitrary sites, enabling session-fixation attacks. Additionally, a successful attack can also alter `document.domain`, potentially leading to cross-site scripting attacks against pages that use document.domain. 
    *   By spoofing hostname, the attacker can trick users into thinking they are on a trusted site, leading to potential data theft.
    *   May potentially expose other sensitive information such as user credentials
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker could craft a malicious web page that, when viewed by a user, sets the `location.hostname` to a malicious value.
    *   This can occur via an iframe or by injecting malicious html.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to serve or inject HTML content into the user's browser. This can happen on any site with user-contributed HTML content, or through a compromised web server.

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry ([229987](show_bug.cgi?id=229987)) provides some more information about a related issue that arose from the fix, where an updated Seamonkey package broke other applications linked against the NSS library. This shows that the original fix was not comprehensive and had side effects.
*   The Mozilla Bugzilla entry ([370445](show_bug.cgi?id=370445)) shows the lengthy process in identifying the root cause, a test case, as well as a fix that was released.
*   The fix involved changes in the `nsStandardURL.cpp` and `nsURLHelper.cpp` files within the Mozilla codebase.
*   The vulnerability was present in various Mozilla-based products, including Firefox and SeaMonkey.
*  The vupen and ovh content are not relevant as they are under construction pages from OVH cloud and do not provide information about this CVE.

In summary, CVE-2007-0981 is a vulnerability in Mozilla-based browsers stemming from the incorrect handling of null characters in the `location.hostname` property which can be exploited for XSS or session-fixation attacks. The provided bugzilla content reveals a long process for addressing the root cause and releasing a fix, with discussion of various implications and mitigation efforts.
