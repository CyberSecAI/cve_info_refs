Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `install.php` file in Somery 0.4.6 is vulnerable to remote file inclusion (RFI) due to the insecure usage of the `$skindir` variable within `include()` statements.
* The application does not sanitize the user-supplied `skindir` parameter, which is directly used in `include` statements without validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include arbitrary remote files, which is a classic RFI vulnerability. This happens because the `skindir` variable is extracted from the URL parameters and used directly in `include` statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable Somery application. This can lead to a complete compromise of the server.
*   **Data Theft and Manipulation:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal sensitive data, deface the website, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `install.php` script.
*   **`skindir` Parameter:** The malicious URL of the attacker-controlled file is supplied as a value to the `skindir` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to reach the vulnerable server and must be able to host a malicious file on a server reachable by the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to construct HTTP GET requests.
*   **Vulnerable Application:** The attacker needs to identify and target a vulnerable installation of Somery 0.4.6.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippets are:
    ```php
    include("$skindir/header.php");
    include("$skindir/footer.php");
    ```
    These lines directly include the files specified by the attacker-controlled `$skindir` variable.
*   The exploit URL format is:
    `http://[domain]/[path]/upload/install.php?skindir=[URL of attacker-controlled file]`
* The exploit also targets a similar vulnerability in `upload/admin/system/include.php`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `install.php` file is meant to be removed after the initial setup, but if it is not, the vulnerability is present.
*   The use of `include()` instead of `require()` is noted; `include()` results in a warning, whereas `require()` would cause a fatal error. This allows the script to continue even when the file inclusion fails, making the vulnerability exploitable.
* The exploit is also applicable to `upload/admin/system/include.php`
* The EDB entry states that CVE-2006-4669 is related, but this entry is for a similar vulnerability in "phpEventMan".
