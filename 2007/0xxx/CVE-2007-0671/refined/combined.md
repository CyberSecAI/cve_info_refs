## Microsoft Excel memory access vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#613740

Original Release Date: 2007-02-05 | Last Revised: 2007-03-13

---

### Overview

An unspecified vulnerability in Microsoft Excel may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| Microsoft Excel contains a vulnerability. According to Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-015](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS07-015.mspx)  *The vulnerability is caused when Excel opens a specially crafted Excel file which will results in the access of memory outside intended regions when parsing placeholder data.*This vulnerability affects Microsoft Excel for both Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to open a specially crafted Office document, an attacker could execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Update for Microsoft**Microsoft has addressed this vulnerability in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-015](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS07-015.mspx). |
| --- |

| **Do not open untrusted Office documents**Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected Excel or other Office documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip [ST04-010](http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-010.html).**Do not rely on file name extension filtering**In most cases, Windows will call the appropriate Office application to open a document even if the document has an unknown file extension. For example, if document.qwer contains the correct file header information for a Excel document, Windows will open document.qwer with Excel. Filtering for common Office file extensions (e.g., .xls, .doc, and .ppt) will not detect all Office documents. **Disable automatic opening of Microsoft Office documents**By default, Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft Office 2000 will configure Internet Explorer to automatically open Microsoft Office documents. This feature can be disabled by using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=8B5762D2-077F-4031-9EE6-C9538E9F2A2F&displaylang=en). Mozilla Firefox users should disable automatic opening of files, as specified in the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#ffdownloadactions) document. |

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves two newly discovered, privately and publicly reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in its own subsection in the "Vulnerability Details" section of this bulletin.

When using vulnerable versions of Office, if a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

**How is this update related to MS06-058?**

Further investigation of CVE-2006-3877 as originally detailed in MS06-058 revealed that the update was not effective in removing the vulnerability from affected systems. This security bulletin has been issued to properly address CVE-2006-3877 and customers should apply the updates in this bulletin immediately.

**Why does this update replace MS06-062 and not MS06-058?**

Further investigation of CVE-2006-3877 revealed that fixing the vulnerability in PowerPoint.exe was not effective. This update has been issued and installs a version of mso.dll that effectively addresses CVE-2006-3877. Because this security bulletin is a mso.dll update, it replaces the previous mso.dll update which is MS06-062.

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?**

The following table provides the MBSA detection summary for this security update.

| Product | MBSA 1.2.1 | MBSA 2.0 |

| Microsoft Office 2003 | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac | No | No |

**Note** MBSA 1.2.1 uses an integrated version of the Office Detection Tool (ODT) which does not support remote scans of this security update. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about the programs that Microsoft Update and MBSA 2.0 currently do not detect, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 895660](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/895660).

For more detailed information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910723](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/910723).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

The following table provides the SMS summary for this security update.

| Software | SMS 2.0 | SMS 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Office 2000 | Yes | No |
| Microsoft Office XP | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Office 2003 | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac | No | No |

SMS uses MBSA for detection. Therefore, SMS has the same limitation that is listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA does not detect.
For SMS 2.0, the SMS SUS Feature Pack, which includes the Security Update Inventory Tool, can be used by SMS to detect security updates. SMS SUIT uses the MBSA 1.2.1 engine for detection. For more information about the Security Update Inventory Tool, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/2003/featurepacks/suspack). For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460). The SMS SUS Feature Pack also includes the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect required updates for Microsoft Office applications.

For SMS 2003, the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates can be used by SMS to detect security updates that are offered by [Microsoft Update](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate) and that are supported by [Windows Server Update Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120). For more information about the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50757). SMS 2003 can also use the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect required updates for Microsoft Office applications.

**Note** If you have used an Administrative Installation Point for deploying Office 2000, Office XP or Office 2003, you may not be able to deploy the update using SMS if you have updated the AIP from the original baseline.

# Security Update Severity Rating System

Attacks that impact customers' systems rarely result from attackers' exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Rather, they exploit vulnerabilities for which patches are available but not applied. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that customers make patching a priority. Currently available updates are listed in the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/).

However, not all vulnerabilities are equally severe. To help customers understand the risk associated with each vulnerability we patch, we have published a severity rating system that rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome were that vulnerability to be exploited.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution ***without*** user interaction. These scenarios include self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Critical updates immediately. |
| Important | A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where client is compromised ***with***warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt's provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Important updates at the earliest opportunity. |
| Moderate | Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability only to non-default configurations.  Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update. |
| Low | Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems. |

The measure of a vulnerability’s severity is distinct from the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. To assess that likelihood, the [Microsoft Exploitability Index](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc998259) provides additional information to help customers better prioritize the deployment of Microsoft security updates. This index provides customers with guidance on the likelihood of functioning exploit code being developed for vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft security updates, within the first thirty days of that update's release.

While this severity rating system is intended to provide a broadly objective assessment of each issue, we strongly encourage customers to evaluate their own environments and make decisions about which updates are required to protect their systems.
