Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Vulnerability:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

**Root Cause:** The AllMyGuests application version 0.3.0 is vulnerable to remote file inclusion due to the insecure use of the `AMG_serverpath` parameter in multiple PHP files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsanitized user input: The `AMG_serverpath` parameter is directly used in include/require statements without proper validation or sanitization.
- Remote File Inclusion: This allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can execute malicious PHP code on the server hosting the AllMyGuests application by including a file containing malicious code. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, data theft, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests: The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the `AMG_serverpath` parameter and a URL pointing to the attacker's controlled server with malicious php file.
- Specifically, the vulnerability can be exploited through the following files using the `AMG_serverpath` parameter:
    - `/include/submit.inc.php`
    - `/admin/index.php`
    - `/include/cm_submit.inc.php`
    - `/comments.php`
    - `/index.php`
    - `/signin.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker must have access to a server to host the malicious file.

**More Details than CVE:**
- This exploit-db entry provides specific vulnerable files and attack URLs, which gives more detailed exploitation information than the basic CVE description.
- It also highlights that multiple files within the application are vulnerable to the same issue.
