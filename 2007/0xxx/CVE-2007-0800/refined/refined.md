  "CVE-2007-0800": {
    "description": "The Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey browsers allows remote attackers to bypass the popup blocker and perform cross-site scripting attacks by using a javascript: URL when opening a blocked popup, related to the requestingWindowURI. This is fixed in Firefox 1.5.0.10, Firefox 2.0.0.2, and SeaMonkey 1.0.8.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Firefox",
      "SeaMonkey"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The browser uses the requesting URI to find the child-window that the popup was opened on, and in this case there's two child windows with the same data: URI and thus we end up with the wrong one. The one we end up finding has the principals of its containing frame, which are different than that of the frame that was used to open the blocked popup, and thus we end up executing the javascript: URI in a frame the original caller didn't have access to.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-site scripting",
         "Insecure pop-up restrictions"
      ],
       "impact": "A remote attacker can perform a cross-site scripting attack by convincing a user to open a blocked popup.",
      "attack_vector": "A malicious web page could trigger the vulnerability by framing a target site and another frame with the same data: URL, then attempting to open a javascript: URL popup from the data frame. It requires user interaction to open the blocked popup."
     ,
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website and trick a user into interacting with it."
