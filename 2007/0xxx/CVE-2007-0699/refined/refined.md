```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application suffers from a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing for both local and remote file inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files (potentially sensitive system files like /etc/passwd) or remote files (e.g., containing malicious code) through the vulnerable parameters. This could lead to information disclosure, arbitrary code execution, and full compromise of the affected system.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET parameter manipulation."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required."
