{
  "CVE-2007-0446": {
    "Description": "The magentproc.exe service provided with some HP Mercury products fails to properly parse values in the server_ip_name field. If an overly long value is sent in this parameter, a stack-based buffer overflow may be triggered within the mchan.dll library.",
    "Root cause": "Improper parsing of the 'server_ip_name' field in network packets.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote, unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted network packet to TCP port 54345.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to send network packets to the vulnerable service on port 54345. No authentication is needed."
