Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-0894

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that certain `.deps.php` files within the MediaWiki skins directory were directly accessible via web requests. These files were intended to be included by other PHP scripts and not accessed directly. When accessed directly, they attempt to include other files but fail, revealing the server's file system paths in error messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Full Path Disclosure (FPD):** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the server's file system paths due to the direct access of `.deps.php` files.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Access Control:** The system fails to validate if the `.deps.php` files are being accessed through the proper channels and not directly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's internal file paths.
- **Aid in Further Attacks:** The disclosed paths can assist attackers in exploiting other vulnerabilities, such as local file inclusion (LFI) by knowing how many directories to traverse to reach sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by directly accessing the vulnerable `.deps.php` files via a web browser or HTTP client, for example: `http://openclipart.org/wiki/skins/Simple.deps.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs to have network access to the vulnerable MediaWiki instance.
- **No Authentication:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable files are located in the `/wiki/skins/` directory. Specifically: `Simple.deps.php`, `MonoBook.deps.php`, `MySkin.deps.php`, and `Chick.deps.php`.
- The error message contains the full path of the web application (e.g., `/srv/clipart.freedesktop.org/clipart_web/wiki/skins/Simple.deps.php`).
- The issue was resolved by ensuring that these `.deps.php` files cannot be called directly.
- The fix was implemented in MediaWiki revisions r19681 in trunk, and backported to other releases (r19682 for REL1_9, r19683 for REL1_8, r19684 for REL1_6)
