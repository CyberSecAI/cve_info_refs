How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why did Microsoft reissue this bulletin on June 12, 2007?**

This bulletin has been re-released adding Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 as an affected product. Customers who installed this update before applying Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 do not need to reapply this update.

**What are the known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update?**

[Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 924667](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=924667) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 924667](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=924667).

* [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 933273](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=933273): The MFC source file Oleui2.cpp is not updated when you install security update MS07-012.
* [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 933339](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=933339): The Mfc42u.dll file is not updated when you install security update MS07-012.

**I am using Microsoft Windows Server 2003 or Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1. I have already installed the original version of security update MS07-012. Do I need to re-install this revised version?**

No. Customers who installed this update before applying Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 do not need to reapply this update.

**Does this security update remove the same vulnerability as those addressed in MS07-011 and MS07-013?**

No, each individual security bulletin addresses unique security vulnerabilities in different software components; however, similarities do exist between the three security bulletins in how an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities. It should be noted that MS07-011 (*OLE*) includes a defense-in-depth improvement that helps to block known attack vectors to the vulnerability addressed in MS07-012 (*MFC*). Even with the MS07-011 defense-in-depth improvement Microsoft strongly recommends that all three security updates be deployed to address all known vulnerabilities.

**Do I need to deploy this security update before MS07-011 and MS07-013?**

No, the security updates in the three security bulletins can be deployed in any order. There are no application compatibility dependencies between the security updates in the three security bulletins.

**I am developing software which containing redistributable files from Visual Studio 6.0. Since my software contains mfc40u.dll and mfc42u.dll, are they affected by this issue? Also, if affected, how should we address it since support for Visual Studio 6.0 has ended?**

Since Microsoft only provides security updates for supported versions of its software and support for Visual Studio 6.0 has ended, we recommend that you upgrade your software to use a supported version of Visual Studio such as Visual Studio 2005.

**I am developing software that statically links to the file mfc70u.lib from Visual Studio .NET 2002 or the file mfc71u.lib from Visual Studio .NET 2003. What do I do?**

You should install the security updates included in this security bulletin for Visual Studio .NET 2002 and Visual Studio .NET 2003 as appropriate, rebuild your application using the updated static libraries for MFC found in the security update, and issue an updated version of your application to your customers.

If you are using Visual Studio .NET 2003, you should refer to [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 933273](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/933273/) and download the MFC source files from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=48e4c8fa-7a8c-41dc-af1c-e9e3be107171). This is especially important if you have rebuilt the MFC libraries from source and are either statically or dynamically linking to the libraries you have built. You should download the update source and rebuild the MFC libraries ***before*** you rebuild your application.

**I am developing software which contains the redistributable file mfc70u.dll from Visual Studio .NET 2002 or the file mfc71u.dll from Visual Studio .NET 2003. What do I do?**

You should install the security updates included in this security bulletin for Visual Studio .NET 2002 or Visual Studio .NET 2003 as appropriate. If you have redistributed mfc70u.dll or mfc71u.dll with your application, you should issue an updated version of your application to your customers with the updated versions of these files included in this security update for Visual Studio .NET 2002 or Visual Studio .NET 2003.

**Copies of mfc40u.dll and mfc42u.dll are found in folders other than %windir%\system32. What do I do?**

You need to contact the software vendor that provided the application redistributing one or more of these files and ask the vendor for an updated version of the software which comes with a newer version of the files.

**I am using Microsoft SQL Server 2000, which contains the redistributable file, mfc71u.dll, from Visual Studio .NET 2003. Does a vulnerability exist in this file?**

No. Microsoft SQL Server 2000 is not affected. The file, mfc71u.dll, does not require an update to remain secure once the specific operating system update is applied.

**I have installed a version of the Platform SDK, which contains the file, mfc42u.dll, that is updated in this security bulletin. Does vulnerability exist in this file?**

No. Platform SDK is not affected. The file, mfc42u.dll, provided by any version of the Platform SDK does not require an update to remain secure once the specific operating system update is applied.

**I am using a third-party application which contains the redistributable files mfc70u.dll from Visual Studio .NET 2002 or the file mfc71u.dll from Visual Studio .NET 2003. Does a vulnerability exist in these files? If yes, how should we address it?**

You need to contact the software vendor that provided the application redistributing one or more of these files and ask the vendor for an updated version of the software which comes with a newer version of the files.

**I am using a third-party application which contains redistributable files from Visual Studio 6.0. Since these applications contain mfc40u.dll and mfc42u.dll, are they affected by this issue? Also, if affected, how should we address it since support for Visual Studio 6.0 has ended?**

## Vulnerability Details

#### MFC Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0025:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the MFC component provided with Microsoft Windows and Visual Studio. An attacker could attempt to exploit this vulnerability when a user interacts with a malformed embedded OLE object within a Rich Text Format (RTF) file or a Rich Text e-mail message.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for MFC Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0025:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* An attacker could only exploit this vulnerability when a user opens and then interacts with an embedded OLE object within a Rich Text Format (RTF) file or a Rich Text e-mail message.
* This vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an RTF file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince the user to open the file.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message and then interact with an embedded OLE object within a Rich Text Format (RTF) file, or interact with an embedded OLE object within a Rich Text e-mail message.

#### Workarounds for MFC Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0025:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Enable Embedded Object blocking in Wordpad.exe**

  **Note:** This workaround only applies to Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2, Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 systems.

  Wordpad.exe is the default application used to open Rich Text files. Users can temporarily block the parsing of embedded objects within Rich Text Files.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  We recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.

  Use the following text to create a .reg file that will automate editing of the registry to temporarily block the parsing of embedded objects with Rich Text Files when using Wordpad.exe. You can copy the following text, paste it into a text editor such as Notepad, and then save the file with the .reg file name extension. Run the .reg file on the vulnerable client.

  **Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00**

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\RtfStreamIn\ObjectBlocking\wordpad.exe]

  **Impact of Workaround:** Wordpad.exe will no longer parse embedded objects within Rich Text files.
* Do not open or save RTF files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
* **Un-install WordPad from Windows 2000 or Windows 2003**

  Wordpad.exe is the default application used to open Rich Text files. By uninstalling WordPad, users can block the parsing of embedded objects within Rich Text Files.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Control Panel**, and then click **Add or Remove Programs**.
  2. Click **Add/Remove Windows Components**, double-click **Accessories and Utilities**, and then double-click **Accessories**.
  3. Uncheck **Wordpad**, click **Okay** to let the Optional Component manager uninstall Wordpad.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Wordpad will no longer parse embedded objects within Rich Text files.

#### FAQ for MFC Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0025:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the MFC component provided with Microsoft Windows and Visual Studio. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when a user interacts with a malformed embedded OLE object within a Rich Text Format (RTF) file, or a Rich Text e-mail message. If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative rights.

**What is Rich Text Format (RTF)?**

The Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification provides a format for text and graphics interchange that can be used with different output devices, operating environments, and operating systems.

**What is OLE?**

By using OLE technology, an application can provide embedding and linking support. OLE is the technology that applications use to create and edit compound documents. These are documents of one format, such as a Microsoft Word document, that contain embeddings of (or links to) documents of another format, such as Microsoft Excel. OLE 2.0 takes OLE even further by allowing in-place editing. Instead of launching a new application when an OLE object is activated, the user instead sees a new set of menu items inside their existing application. For more information about OLE, visit the following [MSDN Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms693383.aspx).

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Windows MFC components do not perform sufficient validation when parsing OLE objects embedded within RTF files. When a user interacts with a malformed embedded OLE Object within an RTF file, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause arbitrary code to run with the privileges of the user who opened the file.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could only exploit this vulnerability when a user opens and then interacts with an embedded OLE object within a Rich Text Format (RTF) file or a Rich Text e-mail message.

This vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an RTF file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince the user to open the file.

The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message and then interact with an embedded OLE object within the RTF file, or interact with an embedded OLE object within a Rich Text e-mail message.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Windows MFC components parse OLE streams within RTF files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

See the frequently asked question, âCan I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?â in the section, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update, earlier in this bulletin.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB924667\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 924667 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files.

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the frequently asked question, âCan I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?â in the section, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update, earlier in this bulletin.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  Windows Server 2003, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition; Windows Small Business Server 2003; Windows Server 2003, Web Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Web Edition with SP2; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition with SP2; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP2; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP2; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP2 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP2 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Standard x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003, Standard x64 Edition Service Pack 2; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise x64 Edition Service Pack 2; and Windows Server 2003, Datacenter x64 Edition Service Pack 2:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP3\KB924667-v2\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 924667 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the frequently asked question, âCan I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?â in the section, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update, earlier in this bulletin.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Updates\Visual Studio\7.1\M924643
  "Installed" = dword:1

#### Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 Service Pack 1

**Prerequisites**
This security update requires Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 Service Pack 1.

**Inclusion in Future Service Packs**
The update for this issue will be included in future Service Pack or Update Rollup.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **/?** | Displays the command-line options. |  |  |
| Setup Modes |  |  |  |
| **/q** | Quiet installation. |  |  |
| Install Options |  |  |  |
| **/I** | Install (default action). |  |  |
| **/U** | Uninstall. |  |  |
| **/Xp[:path]** | Extract the package to the specified directory. |  |  |
| Restart Options |  |  |  |
| **/q** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |  |  |
| Logging Options |  |  |  |
| **/l <LogFile>** | Generate Log file. |  |  |
| \*\*/l[d | p | f ] <LogFile>\*\* | d - Log package details p - Log affected products f - Log included files |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command.

**Deployment Information**

To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt:

**VS7.1sp1-KB927696-x86 /q**

**Note** Use of this command will also install the security update without forcing the system to restart.

**Note** Use of the **/q** switch will suppress all messages. This includes suppressing failure messages. Administrators should use one of the supported methods to verify the installation was successful when they use the **/q** switch. Administrators should also review the KB927696.log file for any failure messages when they use this switch.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939).

For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

## Microsoft MFC component vulnerable to remote code execution via malformed embedded OLE object

#### Vulnerability Note VU#932041

Original Release Date: 2007-02-14 | Last Revised: 2007-09-19

---

### Overview

A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the MFC component that is provided with Microsoft Windows and Visual Studio

### Description

| The Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC), is a Microsoft library that wraps parts of the Windows API in C++ classes. MFC is included in Microsoft [Visual Studio](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default.aspx) and Microsoft Windows.  Per Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-012](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/ms07-012.mspx), a memory corruption vulnerability exists in the MFC component that is provided with Microsoft Windows and Visual Studio. An attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to open a malformed embedded OLE object within a Rich Text Format ([RTF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rtf)) file.Note that reports indicate that Visual Studio 2005 and Windows Vista are unaffected by this vulnerability, however Windows Server 2003 is affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user who is running Windows. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**Microsoft has released an update to address this issue. See Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-012](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/ms07-012.mspx) for more details. This [advisory](http://securityvulns.com/Qdocument368.html) states that the patch is incomplete. |
| --- |

| **Do not run Windows with administrator privileges**Running Windows using an unprivileged regular user account may mitigate the affects of this vulnerability. See the Microsoft Technet article [Applying the Principle of Least Privilege to User Accounts on Windows XP](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/luawinxp.mspx) for more information.**Do not allow WordPad to parse embedded files**Microsoft [WordPad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPad) is the default application for opening and interacting with RTF files in Microsoft Windows. Preventing WordPad from parsing embedded OLE objects in RTF files may partially mitigate this vulnerability. See the workarounds section of Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-012](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/ms07-012.mspx) for instructions on how to edit the Windows registry to prevent WordPad from parsing these objects. |
