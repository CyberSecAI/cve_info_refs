Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2007-0713:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Apple QuickTime Player. Specifically, a crafted .mov file can trigger the overflow when loaded by the player.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap buffer overflow:  The vulnerability is triggered by writing beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running QuickTime.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be exploited to crash the application, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted .mov file:** A malicious actor crafts a .mov file designed to exploit the heap overflow.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening the crafted QuickTime movie file. This can be done via:
    - Embedding the malicious file on a web page
    - Sending the file as an email attachment
    - Using other means to get the victim to load the file into QuickTime

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated attacker:**  The attacker does not need to be on the local network or authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Ability to create a malicious .mov file:** The attacker must have the capability to craft a malicious .mov file to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Ability to distribute the malicious file:** The attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious .mov file to the victim (e.g., via a website or email).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was tested and confirmed on QuickTime 7.1 (Windows version). It may be present in prior versions as well.
- Apple iTunes includes the QuickTime Player, making iTunes users also vulnerable.
- The vulnerability involves memory corruption during heap allocation and deallocation, leading to a crash when freeing the corrupted memory.
- The vulnerability was initially reported to the vendor on 03/09/2006, with a security bulletin released on 06/03/2007.
- Apple addressed this vulnerability in QuickTime version 7.1.5.

**Mitigation:**

- Upgrade to QuickTime 7.1.5 or later.
- Avoid opening .mov files from untrusted sources.
- Disable automatic opening of QuickTime files in web browsers.
- Limit privileges for users running QuickTime

The information provided in these sources gives a detailed account of a heap overflow vulnerability in Apple QuickTime Player, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.
