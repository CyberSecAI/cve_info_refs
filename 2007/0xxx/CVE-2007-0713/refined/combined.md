How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

All rights reserved.
Severity: Critical - potencial remote code execution.
Software affected: Tested on QucikTime 7.1 (Windows version), with
all newest add-ons.
Timeline: 03/09/2006 Vulerability sent to the vendor.
03/09/2006 Initial vendor response.

I. BACKGROUND
Apple QuickTime Player is one of the Apple QuickTime components
used by hundreds of millions of users.
II. DESCRIPTION
Apple QuickTime Player is reported prone to remote heap overflow
vulnerability (exploitable via remotely originated content).
Lets take a look of allocated heap blocks:
----// SNIP SNIP //-------------------------------------------------
K: 66191 -> [\*] HeapAlloc(0x00f00000,0x00000000,0x00000050(00000080))=0x013a0e68 end at: 0x013a0eb8
K: 66192 -> [\*] HeapAlloc(0x01160000,0x00000001,0x00000057(00000087))=0x01228c40 end at: 0x01228c97
K: 66193 -> [\*] HeapAlloc(0x01160000,0x00000001,0x0000002b(00000043))=0x01228cb0 end at: 0x01228cdb
-> [\*] HeapFree(0x1160000,0x1,0x1228C40)
-> [\*] Freed()
-> [\*] HeapFree(0x1160000,0x1,0x1228CB0)
-> [\*] Freed()
K: 66194 -> [\*] HeapAlloc(0x01160000,0x00000001,0x00000028(00000040))=0x01228c40 end at: 0x01228c68
-> [\*] HeapFree(0x1160000,0x1,0x1228C40)
-> [\*] Freed()
K: 66195 -> [\*] HeapAlloc(0x00f00000,0x00000008,0x00000020(00000032))=0x013a0ed0 end at: 0x013a0ef0
K: 66196 -> [\*] HeapAlloc(0x01160000,0x00000001,0x00000028(00000040))=0x01228c40 end at: 0x01228c68 \*(A)
-> [\*] HeapFree(0x1160000,0x1,0x1228C40) \*(B)
----// SNIP SNIP //-------------------------------------------------
The memory block, marked as A is being corrupted here:
----// SNIP SNIP //-------------------------------------------------
66949879 8901 MOV DWORD PTR DS:[ECX],EAX
----// SNIP SNIP //-------------------------------------------------
This leads to future problems within next operations on heap blocks, here with
freeing the broken heap memory block (freeing done by point marked as B).
The vulnerability may lead to remote code execution when specially
crafted MOV file is being loaded.
