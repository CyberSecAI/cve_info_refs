## Microsoft Windows Media Format Runtime ASF handling buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#319385

Original Release Date: 2007-12-12 | Last Revised: 2007-12-13

---

### Overview

Microsoft Windows Media Format Runtime is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. This vulnerability may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on an vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft Windows Media Format Runtime is used by various Windows Media applications such as Windows Media Player. The Windows Media Format Runtime includes the ability to play Advanced Systems Format (ASF) files, which can contain streaming audio, video, slide shows and synchronized events. A heap-based buffer overflow exists due to Microsoft Windows Media Format Runtime's improper parsing of ASF files. By successfully persuading a user to access a specially crafted ASF file, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could trigger the buffer overflow. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why did Microsoft reissue this bulletin on August 20, 2008?**

This bulletin has been reissued to move Windows Media Format Runtime 9 when installed on Windows XP Service Pack 3 to the Non-Affected Software table.

**Why did Microsoft reissue this bulletin on June 10, 2008?**

This bulletin has been reissued to add Windows Media Format Runtime 9, Windows Media Format Runtime 9.5, and Windows Media Format Runtime 11 as affected components for Windows XP Service Pack 3. This is a detection change only to offer and install the package on Windows XP Service Pack 3 systems. There were no changes to the binaries. Customers with Windows XP who have already installed the security update will not need to reinstall the update after applying Windows XP Service Pack 3.

**What are the known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update?**

[Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 941569](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/941569) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 944275](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/944275) document the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The articles also document recommended solutions for these issues.

**On Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Service Pack 3, does this bulletin replace all updates offered by MS06-078?**

For Windows Media Format Runtime 9.5 and Windows Media Format Runtime 11 on Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Service Pack 3, the update offered by [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 941569](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/941569) will not supersede MS06-078. For Windows Media Format Runtime 9 on Windows XP Service Pack 2, the update offered by [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 941569](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/941569) will partially supersede MS06-078, replacing the Windows Media Format Runtime 9 update addressed by [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 923689](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/923689). The update for Media Player 6.4 addressed in MS06-078 (925398) is not superseded and will still need to be deployed for Windows XP Service Pack 2.

**When deploying this update using WSUS, why am I offered two update bundles with identical titles and descriptions?**

Customers using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) will see two update bundles which have identical titles and descriptions for Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Service Pack 3. This issue results from separation of detection metadata to detect different versions of Windows Media Format Runtime on Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Service Pack 3. The solution is to deploy both update bundles for Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Service Pack 3. For customers installing this update through Windows Update the Microsoft detections and deployment tools will install the correct updates so all files are replaced as superseded.

**For Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, do I need to install both Windows Media Format Runtime updates: the Windows Media Format Runtime 9.5 for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and the Windows Media Format Runtime 9.5 x64 Edition for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition?**

Yes, there may be situations where you need to install both updates. If you installed Windows Media Format Runtime x64 Edition, you have to install both the Windows Media Format Runtime 9.5 for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and the Windows Media Format Runtime 9.5 x64 Edition for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition.

**For Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition, do I need to install both Windows Media Format Runtime updates: the Windows Media Format Runtime 9.5 for Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition and the Windows Media Format Runtime 9.5 x64 Edition for Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition?**

Yes, there may be situations where you need to install both updates. If you installed Windows Media Format Runtime x64 Edition, you have to install both the Windows Media Format Runtime 9.5 for Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition and the Windows Media Format Runtime 9.5 x64 Edition for Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition.

**Why is Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems not listed in the affected or non-affected software sections?**

Windows Media Format Runtime is not an installable component on Windows Server 2003 with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems and Windows Server 2003 with SP2 for Itanium-based Systems. Windows Media Services did not ship as an optional component on Windows Server 2003 with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems and Windows Server 2003 with SP2 for Itanium-based Systems.

## Windows Media Format Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Parsing ASF - CVE-2007-0064

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Media Format Runtime due to the way it handles Advanced Systems Format (ASF) files. In client applications, such as Windows Media Player, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing specially crafted Windows Media Format Runtime content that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visits a specially crafted Web site or opens an e-mail message with specially crafted content. In server applications, such as Windows Media Services, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing specially crafted Windows Media Format Runtime content that could potentially allow remote code execution if the server processes the specially crafted content. In client and server applications, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-0064](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0064).

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Media Format Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Parsing ASF - CVE-2007-0064

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, which could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* **Mitigating Factors for Client Application:**
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* Windows Media Player 6.4 when installed on Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows Server 2003 is not affected.
* **Mitigating Factors for Server Application:**
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the network service account.
* Windows Media Services 9.1, which includes wmsserver.dll, is an optional operating system component on all supported 32-bit editions of Windows Server 2003, and x64-based editions of Windows Server 2003.

#### Workarounds for Windows Media Format Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Parsing ASF - CVE-2007-0064

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

The core workaround for these vulnerabilities is to deny access to the vulnerable DLLs on each affected operating system.

* **For client applications deny access to WMASF.DLL**

  From an administrative command prompt in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 run the following command:

  `Echo y| cacls exe %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\WMASF.DLL /E /P everyone:N`

  From an elevated command prompt in Windows Vista run the following commands:

  ```
  Takeown.exe /f %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\WMASF.DLL
  Icacls.exe %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\WMASF.DLL /save %TEMP%\WMASF_ACL.TXT
  Icacls.exe %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\WMASF.DLL /deny everyone:(F)

  ```

  **Impact of Workaround**: Users will be unable to play Advanced Systems Format (ASF) files.
* **For server applications, Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.**

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Media Format Runtime due to the way it handles Advanced Systems Format (ASF) files. In client applications, such as Windows Media Player, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing specially crafted Windows Media Format Runtime content that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visits a specially crafted Web site or opens an e-mail message with specially crafted content. In server applications, such as Windows Media Services, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing specially crafted Windows Media Format Runtime content that could potentially allow remote code execution if the server processes the specially crafted content. In client and server applications, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Incorrect parsing of Advanced Systems Format (ASF) files within the Windows Media Format Runtime.

**What is Windows Media Format Runtime?**

The Microsoft Windows Media Format Runtime provides information and tools for applications that use Windows Media content. For more information, see the product documentation.

**What is Windows Media Services 9.1?**

The Windows Media Services 9.1, which includes wmsserver.dll, is an optional operating system component on all supported 32-bit editions of Windows Server 2003, and x64-based editions of Windows Server 2003. This server application runs as a low privileged networking service account for processing media files. For more information, see the product documentation.

**What is Advanced Systems Format (ASF)?**

ASF (Advanced Systems Format) is a file format that stores audio and video information and is specially designed to run over networks like the Internet. It is a compressed format that contains streaming audio, video, slide shows, and synchronized events. ASF enables content to be delivered to you as a continuous flow of data. ASF files may have the file extensions ASF, WMV, or WMA.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights are less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In a client Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site designed to exploit this vulnerability through Windows Media Player. In no case, however, would an attacker have a way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. In server applications an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing specially crafted Windows Media Format Runtime content that could potentially allow remote code execution if the server processes the specially crafted content.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and opens the specially crafted ASF file in any Windows Media Format Runtime-based application for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Windows Media Format Runtime or Windows Media Server 9.1 s used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Windows Media Format Runtime parses Advanced Systems Format (ASF) files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Vista (all editions)
