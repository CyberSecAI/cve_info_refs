  "CVE-2007-0459": {
    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) can cause the application to crash. The vulnerabilities reside in the TCP dissector, which could hang or crash while reassembling HTTP packets. Additionally, the HTTP dissector, IEEE 802.11 dissector, and LLT dissector could also crash on certain systems. The specific versions affected are 0.10.14 up to and including 0.99.4. Version 0.99.5 addresses these issues.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "0.10.14 up to and including 0.99.4"
    ],
    "fixed_versions": [
      "0.99.5"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Bugs in the TCP, HTTP, IEEE 802.11 and LLT protocol dissectors.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The TCP dissector could hang or crash while reassembling HTTP packets.",
      "The HTTP dissector could crash.",
      "The IEEE 802.11 dissector could crash.",
      "The LLT dissector could crash."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application or using up available memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Injecting a malformed packet onto the network.",
      "Convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file."
    ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "An attacker would need to be able to send network packets that would trigger the vulnerability. This could either be done by sending packets on a network being captured by Wireshark or by supplying a malformed capture file for reading by Wireshark."
      ],
    "additional_notes": "Avaya system products are affected if running vulnerable versions of Wireshark. Avaya recommends restricting network access to the server until an upgrade can be installed. Red Hat also issued an advisory regarding these vulnerabilities. Workarounds include disabling the HTTP, IEEE 802.11 and LLT dissectors."
