```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `index.php` script of SMe FileMailer 1.21. Specifically, the script directly incorporates user-supplied parameters (`$_POST[us]` and `$_POST[ps]`) into an SQL query without any form of escaping or validation.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
SQL Injection vulnerability. The `us` and `ps` parameters are directly included into the SQL query.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can potentially manipulate the SQL query to bypass authentication, access sensitive information, modify data, or execute arbitrary commands on the underlying database server.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `index.php` script, injecting malicious SQL code into the `us` and/or `ps` parameters.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `index.php` file. No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
