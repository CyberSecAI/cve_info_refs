Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `INet_ParseURLServer()` function of Apple QuickTime's streaming component. This function is responsible for parsing URLs, including those using the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a classic stack buffer overflow. By providing a specially crafted, overly long RTSP URL, an attacker can overwrite data on the stack, including the return address.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can also be used to cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker could embed the malicious RTSP URL in a website, causing the vulnerability to trigger when a user visits it.
*   **QTL Files:** The vulnerability can be exploited through specially crafted QuickTime Link files (.QTL).
*   **JavaScript:** JavaScript can be used to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Other Entry Points**: The vulnerable `INet_ParseURLServer()` function is used for generic URL parsing, meaning other attack vectors may exist besides RTSP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker can be remote and does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to deliver a malicious URL**: The attacker needs a way to get the victim to process the crafted URL, such as through a malicious web page, a QTL file, or another means of invoking the vulnerable QuickTime functionality.
*   **Basic knowledge of exploit techniques**: The attacker would need to craft a malicious URL containing specific payload with valid addresses for exploiting the stack buffer overflow.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The exploit requires an attacker to supply a crafted RTSP URL string (e.g. `rtsp://[random] + semicolon + [299 bytes padding + payload]`).
*   The vulnerability affects not only QuickTime, but also Apple iTunes as it incorporates QuickTime components.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available.
*   A patch is available via Apple Security Update 2007-001 which should be applied.
*   The CERT vulnerability note recommends several mitigation techniques, including:
    *   Disabling QuickTime ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer.
    *   Disabling the QuickTime plugin in Mozilla-based browsers.
    *   Disabling QuickTime file associations.
    *   Disabling JavaScript.
    *   Avoiding access to QuickTime files from untrusted sources.
*   The exploit code from Exploit-DB targets Mac OS X 10.4.8 and includes specific addresses for system calls like `system()` and `setuid()` along with other parameters to be overwritten on the stack.
*   The exploit code includes a command to be executed (e.g. "`/usr/bin/say Happy new year shit bag`"), demonstrating the potential for arbitrary code execution. The exploit also has the capability to execute arbitrary shellcode if the address to "/bin/sh" is used.
*   Landon Fuller provided a runtime patch using Application Enhancer which pre-validates URLs.
*   Secunia and other resources are mentioned.
