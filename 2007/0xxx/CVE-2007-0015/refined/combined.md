How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Notes:
# Our command string is loaded on memory at a static address normally,

# be likely successful if we open the resulting QTL file directly, without having an
# instance of Quicktime running. Although, when using another method and string, you'll need
# to find the address.
# For 100% reliable exploitation you can always use the /bin/sh address,
# but that's not as a cool as having your box welcoming the new year.
# Do whatever you prefer. That said, enjoy.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## [Month of Apple Bugs - Day 1](http://landonf.org/code/macosx/MOAB_Day_1.20070102060815.15950.zadder.local.html)

01 Jan 2007, 22:08 PST

I stumbled across the [Month of Apple Bugs](http://projects.info-pull.com/moab/) today -- a new Mac OS X vulnerability released every day for a month.

Today's vulnerability exploits a stack buffer overflow in the QuickTime Streaming component, and includes a working x86 exploit. More details available [here](http://projects.info-pull.com/moab/MOAB-01-01-2007.html). Short summary: if you visit a malicious web page, a remote attacker can execute code on your machine.

So, part brain exercise, part public service, I've created a runtime fix for the first issue using [Application Enhancer](http://www.unsanity.com/haxies/ape). If I have time (or assistance), I'll attempt to patch the other vulnerabilities, one a day, until the month is out.

You can download the [source](/static/moab-1.tar.gz), or download a pre-built [binary](/static/Moab-1.ape.zip). You'll also need to install [Application Enhancer](http://www.unsanity.com/haxies/ape) to use this -- once it's installed, simply double-click on the Moab bundle to install the patch.

I've had one report of the Moab bundle showing up in the Finder as a plain directory. If that occurs, try manually adding the bundle from the Application Enhancer preference pane, in System Preferences (Hit the "+" button).

### Technical Details -- How it Works

The overflow is in the QuickTime Streaming component's INet\_ParseURLServer() function -- the fix patches that function and pre-validates the URL before passing it off to the real function implementation. If the URL is too long, the patch replaces the Evil URL with a benign, but invalid one, and then calls the original function.

It's worth noting that disabling RTSP, as noted elsewhere, is (unfortunately) not necessarily sufficient -- there are other vulnerable entry-points to INet\_ParseURLServer(), as it is used for generic URL parsing.

### Update

Please see [this page](http://landonf.bikemonkey.org/code/macosx) for updates!

## Apple QuickTime RTSP buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#442497

Original Release Date: 2007-01-02 | Last Revised: 2007-01-25

---

### Overview

Apple QuickTime may allow remote arbitrary code to be executed via a long src parameter in RTSP URL strings.

### Description

| A vulnerability exists in the way Apple QuickTime handles specially crafted Real Time Streaming Protocol ([RTSP](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2326.txt)) URL strings. An attacker may be able to craft a [QTL](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuickTime/QT4WebPage/samplechap/special-11.html) file to take advantage of this vulnerability. However, there are other attack vectors that do not involve QTL files. According to [MOAB-01-01-2007](http://projects.info-pull.com/moab/MOAB-01-01-2007.html):  *By supplying a specially crafted string (rtsp:// [random] + semicolon + [299 bytes padding + payload]), an attacker could overflow a stack-based buffer, using either HTML, Javascript or a QTL file as attack vector, leading to an exploitable remote arbitrary code execution condition.*Note that since QuickTime is a component of Apple iTunes, iTunes installations are also affected by this vulnerability. We are aware of publicly available proof-of-concept code that exploits this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Update**This issue is addressed in Apple Security Update [2007-001](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304989). An update for Mac OS X is available on [Apple Downloads](http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/) and via Software Update. An update for Microsoft Windows XP and 2000 systems is availble via the [Apple Software Update](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304264) application installed with QuickTime 7.1.3. |
| --- |

| **Disable the QuickTime ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer**The vulnerable QuickTime ActiveX controls can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSIDs:{02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B}{4063BE15-3B08-470D-A0D5-B37161CFFD69}More information about how to set the kill bit is available in [Microsoft Support Document 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for these controls:Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{4063BE15-3B08-470D-A0D5-B37161CFFD69}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400**Disable the QuickTime plug-in for Mozilla-based browsers**Users of Mozilla-based browsers, such as Firefox can disable the QuickTime plugin, as specified in the PluginDoc article [Uninstalling Plugins](http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/faqs/uninstall.html).**Disable file association for QuickTime files**Disable the file association for QuickTime file types to help prevent windows applications from using Apple QuickTime to open QuickTime files. This can be accomplished by deleting the following registry keys:HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\QuickTime.\*This will remove the association for approximately 32 file types that are configured to open with the QuickTime Player software. **Disable JavaScript**For instructions on how to disable JavaScript, please refer to the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/) document. This can help prevent some attack techniques that use the QuickTime plug-in or ActiveX control.**Do not access QuickTime files from untrusted sources**Attackers may host malicious QuickTime files on web sites. In order to convince users to visit their sites, those attackers often use a variety of techniques to create misleading links including URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, and intentional misspellings. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. |
