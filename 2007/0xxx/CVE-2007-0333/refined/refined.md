Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the insufficient protection of Outpost Firewall's own files. While Outpost employs SSDT hooks to prevent unauthorized modifications, it fails to block the use of the native API `ZwSetInformationFile` with the `FileLinkInformation` class. This API call can be leveraged to replace protected files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate File Protection:** The primary weakness is that Outpost's self-protection mechanism can be bypassed using the `ZwSetInformationFile` API and `FileLinkInformation`.
- **Vulnerable Driver:** The `SandBox.sys` driver, responsible for Outpost's self-protection, is located in the Outpost installation directory and can be replaced.
- **Lack of API Call Validation:** The system fails to validate or block the malicious use of the `ZwSetInformationFile` API in the context of the Outpost protected files

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete System Control:** By replacing the `SandBox.sys` driver with a malicious one, attackers can execute arbitrary code in privileged kernel mode, gaining complete control over the system.
- **Stealth Attacks:** The attack can be implemented stealthily, potentially without the user's awareness.
- **Bypassed Self-Protection:** The attack completely disables Outpost's self-protection, making further attacks easier.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack requires local access to the system.
- **File Replacement:** Attackers replace a legitimate driver file (`SandBox.sys`) with a malicious one.
- **Native API Exploitation:** The attack exploits the system's native API function `ZwSetInformationFile` with the `FileLinkInformation` class.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target system.
- **Ability to Call Native API:** The attacker's code must be able to make calls to the Windows Native API (Zw* functions) in order to use `ZwSetInformationFile`.
- **Ability to Place a Malicious File:** The attacker needs to be able to write the malicious replacement driver file to disk in a location that the `ZwSetInformationFile` can link to.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in multiple versions of Outpost Firewall PRO 4.0, including versions 1005.590.123, 971.584.079, and 964.582.059. It is also likely to affect older versions of Outpost Firewall PRO 4.0 and potentially older versions of Outpost Firewall PRO.
- A proof of concept and source code were made available by Matousec.
- The CVSS base score is 7.2/10, with a complete impact subscore (10/10) and a lower exploitability subscore (3.9/10), due to the local requirement.
