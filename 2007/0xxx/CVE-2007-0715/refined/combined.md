## Apple QuickTime PICT heap buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#448745

Original Release Date: 2007-03-06 | Last Revised: 2007-03-09

---

### Overview

The Apple QuickTime player contains a heap buffer overflow vulnerability. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or create a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| [PICT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PICT) is a graphics file format that was used by Apple Macintosh systems prior to OS X as their standard metafile format. OS X systems can open and display PICT files.  Apple [QuickTime](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/) contains a heap buffer overflow vulnerability. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running QuickTime. By convincing a user to open a specially crafted PICT file with QuickTime, an attacker can trigger the overflow.Apple [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) includes the QuickTime player.Note that this vulnerability may be present in QuickTime versions prior to 7.1.5 running on Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows 2000, XP and Vista. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code or create a denial-of-service condition. The crafted QuickTime PICT file may be supplied on a web page, in an email for the victim to select, or by some other means designed to encourage them to invoke QuickTime on the exploit file. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**Apple has released QuickTime [7.5](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305149) to address this issue. |

| **Do not allow browsers to open QuickTime automatically**Until updates can be applied, do not allow your web browser to open files associated with QuickTime automatically. Consult your web browser's documentation or the references section of this document for more information.**Do not open multimedia files from untrusted sources**Do not open multimedia files that are from untrusted or unknown sources. For more information, please see [Using Caution with Email Attachments](http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-010.html).**Limit privileges**Running QuickTime with reduced privileges may help mitigate the effects of this vulnerability.
