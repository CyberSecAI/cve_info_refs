Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-0609:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal flaw in the Advanced Guestbook application, specifically version 2.4.2. This flaw allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions by manipulating the `lang` cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** Attackers can use ".." (dot dot) sequences within the `lang` cookie to navigate outside the intended directories of the application.
- **Insecure Cookie Handling**: The application does not properly sanitize or validate user input within the `lang` cookie.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary PHP Code Execution:** By injecting a malicious PHP script path, an attacker can force the server to execute their code.
- **Information Disclosure**: The provided example shows that attackers could potentially access sensitive database credentials (`dbName`, `host`, `user`, `pass`) and other potentially sensitive information
- **Complete Compromise:** The vulnerability is rated as having a high risk with complete confidentiality, integrity and availability impact.
- **.htaccess Bypass:** The vulnerability can bypass .htaccess restrictions.
- **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers can read arbitrary local templates.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request with Crafted Cookie:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP request that includes a modified `lang` cookie.
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Server Registration**: The attacker needs to have an account on the vulnerable server.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is only exploitable when a user has registered on the same server.
- The application uses a cookie named "lang" which an attacker manipulates with dot dot sequences to point to an arbitrary file on the server.
- A workaround to mitigate the vulnerability is to set the Advanced Guestbook default static language.
- The vendor was unresponsive to the security advisory.
- The vulnerability was discovered by netVigilance.
- Exploitability is rated as Functional Exploit, which indicates the availability of working exploits
