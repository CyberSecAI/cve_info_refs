Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-0940:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way the Microsoft Cryptographic API Component Object Model (CAPICOM) Certificates ActiveX control validates input. Specifically, the CAPICOM.Certificates class doesn't properly handle certain unexpected data, causing a failure that can be exploited for remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation within the CAPICOM.Certificates ActiveX control.
- The ActiveX control could fail in a way that allows remote code execution if provided with unexpected data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.
- Attackers could execute arbitrary code, install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- Systems with accounts configured with fewer user rights may be less impacted than those with administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker would need to host a malicious website containing a specially crafted webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Attackers must convince users to visit the malicious website, typically by tricking them into clicking a link.
- The exploit requires the user to perform specific actions after accessing the malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to host a malicious website and lure victims to it.
- No authentication is required for exploitation, making unauthenticated attacks possible.
- The attacker needs to craft specific data to send to the ActiveX control to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- Microsoft has classified this vulnerability as **Critical**.
- The vulnerability exists in the CAPICOM.dll file.
-  The vulnerability is addressed by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS07-028.
- The ActiveX control is not enabled by default in Internet Explorer 7 and later, unless previously used or explicitly enabled by the user.
- Enhanced Security Configuration in Windows Server 2003 mitigates some risk by setting the security level for the internet zone to High.
- Workarounds include disabling the CAPICOM ActiveX control or configuring Internet Explorer to prompt before running ActiveX controls.
- The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft by Chris Ries of VigilantMinds Inc.
