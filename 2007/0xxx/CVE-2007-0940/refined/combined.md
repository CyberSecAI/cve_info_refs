How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Vulnerability Details

#### CAPICOM.Certificates Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0940:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Cryptographic API Component Object Model (CAPICOM) that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to take complete control of the affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for CAPICOM.Certificates Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0940:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce the number of successful attacks that exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail, they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/security/szone/overview/esc_changes.asp). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that have not been added to Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* By default, this ActiveX control is not included in the default allow-list for ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer 7. Only customers who have explicitly approved this control by using the ActiveX opt-in feature are at risk to attempts to exploit this vulnerability. However, if a customer has used this ActiveX control in a previous version of Internet Explorer, then this ActiveX control is enabled to work in Internet Explorer 7, even if the customer has not explicitly approved it using the ActiveX opt-in feature.

#### Workarounds for the CAPICOM.Certificates Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0940:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Disable attempts to instantiate the CAPICOM control in Internet Explorer**

  You can disable attempts to instantiate this ActiveX control by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.

  To set the kill bit for the CLSIDs with the value of:

  + {17E3A1C3-EA8A-4970-AF29-7F54610B1D4C}
  + {FBAB033B-CDD0-4C5E-81AB-AEA575CD1338}

  Paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{17E3A1C3-EA8A-4970-AF29-7F54610B1D4C}]

  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{FBAB033B-CDD0-4C5E-81AB-AEA575CD1338}]

  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

  You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

  [Group Policy collection](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/6d7cb788-b31d-4d17-9f1e-b5ddaa6deecd)

  [What is Group Policy Object Editor?](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/47ba1311-6cca-414f-98c9-2d7f99fca8a3)

  [Core Group Policy tools and settings](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/e926577a-5619-4912-b5d9-e73d4bdc9491)

**Note:** You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.

**Impact of Workaround**: The CAPICOM control may no longer display or function correctly.

* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running ActiveX Controls or disable ActiveX Controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your Internet Explorer settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

**Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneâ.

**Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

To do this, follow these steps:
1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

**Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and â\*.update.microsoft.comâ (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to **High**.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High**.

**Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements.

#### FAQ for CAPICOM.Certificates Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0940:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The way that the CAPICOM Certificates class handles certain inputs causes the vulnerability. The ActiveX control could, if passed unexpected data, fail in such a way that could allow remote code execution.

**What is CAPICOM.Certificates?**

CAPICOM.Certificates is an ActiveX control that provides scripters (VBS, ASP, ASP.NET etc.) with a method for encrypting data based on secure underlying Windows CryptoAPI functionality. The CAPICOM Suite is also available for download as [Platform SDK Redistributable: CAPICOM](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=860ee43a-a843-462f-abb5-ff88ea5896f6) and is also part of the Windows Platform SDK and the Windows Driver Kit.

**What if I develop applications or software and redistribute CAPICOM?**

You need to download the latest version of the [Platform SDK Redistributable: CAPICOM](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=860ee43a-a843-462f-abb5-ff88ea5896f6). This new version contains the updated CAPICOM.dll that is associated with this security update.

**How do I know if I have CAPICOM.Certificates installed and registered?**

You can verify whether you have CAPICOM installed by searching on your system for CAPICOM.dll. If you have version 2.1.01 or lower, you should update your system.

You can verify whether you have any combination of the following registry keys to verify whether you have a vulnerable version of the CAPICOM.Certificates ActiveX control registered on your system:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CAPICOM.Certificates.1\CLSID

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CAPICOM.Certificates.2\CLSID

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CAPICOM.Certificates.3\CLSID

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**Why is the old version of CAPICOM.dll still on the system after installing this security update?**

Users may have installed CAPICOM.dll from a source other than Microsoft. CAPICOM.dll may have been installed by a non-Microsoft product. Since the security update cannot determine where the previous CAPICOM.dll version originated, it is left on the system for application compatibility. The previous version does not leave your system vulnerable to this vulnerability.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site containing a Web page used in the attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and visits a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems that have CAPICOM Certificates installed and registered where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer 7. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. Customers who are running Internet Explorer 7 with default settings are not at risk until the CAPICOM Certificates control has been activated through the ActiveX opt-in feature in the Internet Zone. However, if a customer has used this ActiveX control in a previous version of Internet Explorer, then this ActiveX control is enabled to work in Internet Explorer 7, even if the customer has not explicitly approved it using the ActiveX opt-in feature.

**What is the ActiveX opt-in feature in Internet Explorer 7?**

Internet Explorer 7 includes an ActiveX opt-in feature, which means that nearly all pre-installed ActiveX controls are off by default. Users are prompted by the Information Bar before they can access a previously installed ActiveX Control that has not yet been used on the Internet. This enables a user to permit or deny access on a control-by-control basis. For more information about this and other new features, see the [Windows Internet Explorer 7 features page](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie7/about/features/default.mspx).

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/security/szone/overview/esc_changes.asp). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that have not been added to Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

**What is Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?**

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running malicious Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this threat by modifying numerous security-related settings, including Security and Advanced tab settings in Internet Options. Some of the key modifications include:

* Security level for the Internet zone is set to **High**. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX components, Microsoft virtual machine (Microsoft VM) HTML content, and file downloads.
* Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.
* Install on Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.
* Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.

For more information regarding Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration, please consult the Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration guide, which can be found at the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=d41b036c-e2e1-4960-99bb-9757f7e9e31b&displaylang;=en).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the CAPICOM.Certificates ActiveX control performs parameter validation. It also addresses additional issues discovered through internal investigations.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

# Security Update Severity Rating System

Attacks that impact customers' systems rarely result from attackers' exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Rather, they exploit vulnerabilities for which patches are available but not applied. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that customers make patching a priority. Currently available updates are listed in the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/).

However, not all vulnerabilities are equally severe. To help customers understand the risk associated with each vulnerability we patch, we have published a severity rating system that rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome were that vulnerability to be exploited.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution ***without*** user interaction. These scenarios include self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Critical updates immediately. |
| Important | A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where client is compromised ***with***warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt's provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Important updates at the earliest opportunity. |
| Moderate | Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability only to non-default configurations.  Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update. |
| Low | Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems. |

The measure of a vulnerability’s severity is distinct from the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. To assess that likelihood, the [Microsoft Exploitability Index](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc998259) provides additional information to help customers better prioritize the deployment of Microsoft security updates. This index provides customers with guidance on the likelihood of functioning exploit code being developed for vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft security updates, within the first thirty days of that update's release.

While this severity rating system is intended to provide a broadly objective assessment of each issue, we strongly encourage customers to evaluate their own environments and make decisions about which updates are required to protect their systems.
