  "CVE-2007-0773": {
    "description": "a flaw in the fput ioctl handling of 32-bit applications running on 64-bit platforms that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (panic).",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way the Linux kernel handles the `fput` function within the `ioctl` system call for 32-bit applications on 64-bit systems. Specifically a resource leak occurs when calling a specific ioctl. The file descriptor's reference count is not decremented, eventually causing a kernel panic after overflowing",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper resource handling",
       "Incorrect reference count decrement",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user can cause a denial of service (kernel panic)",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Execution of a malicious or crafted 32-bit application"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to execute code locally on the affected system.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered by a 32-bit application calling a specific ioctl on a 64-bit kernel, causing a resource leak. Repeated triggering leads to a kernel panic."
