      "response": "The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS). A remote user could potentially cause the CUPS daemon to crash when negotiating an SSL connection.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of partially-negotiated SSL connections in the CUPS daemon.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The CUPS daemon does not properly handle partially-negotiated SSL connections. This leads to a situation where the daemon does not accept new connections because the initial connection never times out.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition, preventing other users from connecting to the CUPS server.\n\n**Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to initiate a partially-negotiated SSL connection with the CUPS server.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the CUPS server and initiate an SSL handshake."

      "response": "The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) due to incomplete SSL negotiation.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** CUPS does not use separate workers for connections. During SSL negotiation, it does not accept new connections from anyone, leading to a DoS if the negotiation is not completed.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the CUPS daemon's inability to handle multiple connections during SSL negotiation. An incomplete SSL negotiation blocks further connections.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:** A remote user can cause a DoS by initiating an incomplete SSL handshake, preventing other clients from connecting to the CUPS server.\n\n**Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out remotely by initiating an SSL connection but not completing the negotiation.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to connect to the CUPS server and start an SSL handshake."
