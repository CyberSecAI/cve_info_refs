Package        : mozilla-firefox
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-1282 CVE-2007-0994 CVE-2007-0995 CVE-2007-0996 CVE-2007-0981 CVE-2007-0008 CVE-2007-0009 CVE-2007-0775 CVE-2007-0778 CVE-2007-0045 CVE-2006-6077

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox.

This will be the last security update of Mozilla-based products for
the oldstable (sarge) distribution of Debian. We recommend to upgrade
to stable (etch) as soon as possible.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:

CVE-2007-1282

    It was discovered that an integer overflow in text/enhanced message
    parsing allows the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0994

    It was discovered that a regression in the Javascript engine allows
    the execution of Javascript with elevated privileges.

CVE-2007-0995

    It was discovered that incorrect parsing of invalid HTML characters
    allows the bypass of content filters.

CVE-2007-0996

    It was discovered that insecure child frame handling allows cross-site
    scripting.

CVE-2007-0981

    It was discovered that Firefox handles URI withs a null byte in the
    hostname insecurely.

CVE-2007-0008

    It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the NSS code allows the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0009

    It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the NSS code allows the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0775

    It was discovered that multiple programming errors in the layout engine
    allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0778

    It was discovered that the page cache calculates hashes in an insecure
    manner.

CVE-2006-6077

    It was discovered that the password manager allows the disclosure of
    passwords.

For the oldstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-2sarge17. You should upgrade to etch as soon as possible.

The stable distribution (etch) isn't affected. These vulnerabilities have
been fixed prior to the release of Debian etch.

The unstable distribution (sid) no longer contains mozilla-firefox. Iceweasel
is already fixed.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

[Updated 12 March 2007]
Packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3 have been updated to
correct an issue which prevented Evolution and other applications linked
against the NSS library from functioning.

## Description

SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup
client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

Several flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey processed certain malformed
JavaScript code. A malicious web page could execute JavaScript code in such
a way that may result in SeaMonkey crashing or executing arbitrary code as
the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2007-0775, CVE-2007-0777)

Several cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey
processed certain malformed web pages. A malicious web page could display
misleading information which may result in a user unknowingly divulging
sensitive information such as a password. (CVE-2006-6077, CVE-2007-0995,
CVE-2007-0996)

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey cached web pages on the local disk. A
malicious web page may be able to inject arbitrary HTML into a browsing
session if the user reloads a targeted site. (CVE-2007-0778)

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey displayed certain web content. A
malicious web page could generate content which could overlay user
interface elements such as the hostname and security indicators, tricking a
user into thinking they are visiting a different site. (CVE-2007-0779)

Two flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey displayed blocked popup windows.
If a user can be convinced to open a blocked popup, it is possible to read
arbitrary local files, or conduct an XSS attack against the user.
(CVE-2007-0780, CVE-2007-0800)

Two buffer overflow flaws were found in the Network Security Services (NSS)
code for processing the SSLv2 protocol. Connecting to a malicious secure
web server could cause the execution of arbitrary code as the user running
SeaMonkey. (CVE-2007-0008, CVE-2007-0009)

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled the "location.hostname" value
during certain browser domain checks. This flaw could allow a malicious web
site to set domain cookies for an arbitrary site, or possibly perform an
XSS attack. (CVE-2007-0981)

Users of SeaMonkey are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
contain SeaMonkey version 1.0.8 that corrects these issues.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)

## Details

Several flaws have been found that could be used to perform Cross-site

scripting attacks. A malicious web site could exploit these to modify

the contents or steal confidential data (such as passwords) from other

opened web pages. ([CVE-2006-6077](/security/CVE-2006-6077), [CVE-2007-0780](/security/CVE-2007-0780), [CVE-2007-0800](/security/CVE-2007-0800),

[CVE-2007-0981](/security/CVE-2007-0981), [CVE-2007-0995](/security/CVE-2007-0995), [CVE-2007-0996](/security/CVE-2007-0996))

The SSLv2 protocol support in the NSS library did not sufficiently

check the validity of public keys presented with a SSL certificate. A

malicious SSL web site using SSLv2 could potentially exploit this to

execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. ([CVE-2007-0008](/security/CVE-2007-0008))

The SSLv2 protocol support in the NSS library did not sufficiently

verify the validity of client master keys presented in an SSL client

certificate. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary

code in a server application that uses the NSS library.

([CVE-2007-0009](/security/CVE-2007-0009))

Various flaws have been reported that could allow an attacker to

execute arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into

opening a malicious web page. ([CVE-2007-0775](/security/CVE-2007-0775), [CVE-2007-0776](/security/CVE-2007-0776),

[CVE-2007-0777](/security/CVE-2007-0777), [CVE-2007-1092](/security/CVE-2007-1092))

Two web pages could collide in the disk cache with the result that

depending on order loaded the end of the longer document could be

appended to the shorter when the shorter one was reloaded from the

cache. It is possible a determined hacker could construct a targeted

attack to steal some sensitive data from a particular web page. The

potential victim would have to be already logged into the targeted

service (or be fooled into doing so) and then visit the malicious

site. ([CVE-2007-0778](/security/CVE-2007-0778))

David Eckel reported that browser UI elements--such as the host name

and security indicators--could be spoofed by using custom cursor

images and a specially crafted style sheet. ([CVE-2007-0779](/security/CVE-2007-0779))

|  | |

This vulnerability was reported to security@mozilla.org by email from
vendor-disclosure@idefense.com, bearing the subject IDEF1973. It says:
"This vulnerability was reported to iDefense by regenrecht."
An SSL server cert with an RSA public key that is too small to encrypt
the entire SSL2 "Master Secret" will cause optimized (not DEBUG) NSS
builds to crash, and/or execute attacker-supplied code (on some platforms).
Disabling SSL2 is a complete defense. Products with SSL2 disabled are
believed to be invulnerable.
The bug has been present in NSS since at least NSS 3.4 and probably longer.
Function ssl\_FormatSSL2Block starts with an assertion that the modulus is
long enough to properly encode the data to be encrypted, but that only has
effect in DEBUG builds. In non-DEBUG builds, when the modulus is too short,
the code overruns the end of the too-short buffer. The fix is to detect
too-short modulii in all builds, not just DEBUG builds. This probably
should not be an ASSERT at all, but just a run time check.

I reviewed all the other assertions in sslcon.c.
Let's do something about this closely related assertion in sslcon.c:
PORT\_Assert((modulusLen - rek.len) > 12);
Note that > 12 is the same as >= 13. 13 is greater than
(3 + RSA\_BLOCK\_MIN\_PAD\_LEN) by 2.

Wan-Teh, is this what you hand in mind?
If so, please mark patch v1 obsolete and ask Bob to review this one.

patch v2
Nelson, if you agree that the "> 12" in that assertion is wrong
and should be ">= 11", we should simply remove that assertion.
The check you added in this patch is redundant; it's already
performed in the ssl\_FormatSSL2Block call above. Thanks.

patch v2
I have an idea for how to deal with the assertion in
ssl2\_ClientSetupSessionCypher: move the following code,
which sets up the padding for version 2 rollback detection,
to ssl\_FormatSSL2Block. This requires passing 'ss' or
a boolean flag as a new argument to ssl\_FormatSSL2Block
though.
/\* Set up the padding for version 2 rollback detection. \*/
/\* XXX We should really use defines here \*/
if (ss->opt.enableSSL3 || ss->opt.enableTLS) {
PORT\_Assert((modulusLen - rek.len) > 12);
PORT\_Memset(eblock + modulusLen - rek.len - 8 - 1, 0x03, 8);
}
If this code is in ssl\_FormatSSL2Block, it'll be clear
that the assertion is redundant and can be simply removed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2007-06

## Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) SSLv2 buffer overflows

Announced
February 23, 2007
Reporter
iDefense
Impact
Critical (Firefox 2.0 not affected in default configuration)
Products
Firefox, NSS, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.5.0.10
* Firefox 2.0.0.2
* NSS 3.11.5
* SeaMonkey 1.0.8
* Thunderbird 1.5.0.10

### Description

[iDefense](http://labs.idefense.com/)
has informed Mozilla about two potential buffer overflow
vulnerabilities found by researcher **regenrecht**
in the Network Security Services (NSS) code for processing
the SSLv2 protocol.

SSL clients such as Firefox and Thunderbird can suffer
a buffer overflow if a malicious server presents a certificate
with a public key that is too small to encrypt the entire
"Master Secret". Exploiting this overflow appears to be
unreliable but possible if the SSLv2 protocol is enabled.

Servers that use NSS
for the SSLv2 protocol can be exploited by
a client that presents a "Client Master Key" with invalid length
values in any of several fields that are used without adequate
error checking. This can lead to a buffer overflow that
presumably could be exploitable.

Support for SSLv2 is disabled in Firefox 2 due to other known
weaknesses in the protocol; Firefox 2 is not vulnerable unless
the user has modified hidden internal NSS settings to
re-enable SSLv2 support.

### Workaround

Disable the SSLv2 protocol in any product that has not already done so.

**In Firefox 1.5**:

Click on the Advanced icon in the Options/Preferences dialog.

On the Security tab uncheck the box next to "Use SSL 2.0"

click the "OK" button.

**In Thunderbird 1.5**:

Click on the Advanced icon in the Options/Preferences dialog.

Click the "Config Editor..." button.

Type `ssl2` in the Filter field

Double-click `security.enable_ssl2` to change the value
to `false` and close the window.

Server products making use of NSS should also disable the SSLv2 protocol.

Products using the NSS libraries should upgrade
to version 3.11.5

# Mozilla Thunderbird: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200703-18**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Thunderbird, some of
which may allow user-assisted arbitrary remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.10** |

| Package | **mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.10** |

### Background

Mozilla Thunderbird is a popular open-source email client from the
Mozilla Project.

### Description

Georgi Guninski reported a possible integer overflow in the code
handling text/enhanced or text/richtext MIME emails. Additionally,
various researchers reported errors in the JavaScript engine
potentially leading to memory corruption. Additionally, the binary
version of Mozilla Thunderbird includes a vulnerable NSS library which
contains two possible buffer overflows involving the SSLv2 protocol.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to read a specially crafted email that
could trigger one of the vulnerabilities, some of them being related to
Mozilla Thunderbird's handling of JavaScript, possibly leading to the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time for all of these issues, but
some of them can be avoided by disabling JavaScript. Note that the
execution of JavaScript is disabled by default and enabling it is
strongly discouraged.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-1.5.0.10"
```

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-1.5.0.10"
```

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)

## Details

The SSLv2 protocol support in the NSS library did not sufficiently

check the validity of public keys presented with a SSL certificate. A

malicious SSL web site using SSLv2 could potentially exploit this to

execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. ([CVE-2007-0008](/security/CVE-2007-0008))

The SSLv2 protocol support in the NSS library did not sufficiently

verify the validity of client master keys presented in an SSL client

certificate. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary

code in a server application that uses the NSS library. ([CVE-2007-0009](/security/CVE-2007-0009))

Various flaws have been reported that could allow an attacker to execute

arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening a

malicious web page. ([CVE-2007-0775](/security/CVE-2007-0775), [CVE-2007-0776](/security/CVE-2007-0776), [CVE-2007-0777](/security/CVE-2007-0777))

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c0)  Johnny Hughes    2007-02-25 15:49:24 UTC  ``` The seamonkey-1.0.8-x (critical) update prevents evolution from starting.  The following error occurs:  (evolution:32071): evolution-smime-WARNING **: Failed all methods for initializing NSS  Trying to build evolution from the SRPM also does not work as the path for nspr (mozilla 37:1.8) is not the same as the path for nspr (seamonkey 1.0.8).  Using the patch attached to this bug:   <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=202453>  I was able to start Evolution building ... whether it fixes this bug, I will report when it finishes.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c1)  Johnny Hughes    2007-02-25 16:14:17 UTC  ``` rebuilding evolution did not help, the RPM produced built against seamonkey 1.0.8 is identical to the one produced against mozilla   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c2)  Johnny Hughes    2007-02-25 19:50:57 UTC  ``` There is a fix that works as a work around until another solution is done, which list to create this symbolic link:  cd /usr/lib  ln -s firefox-1.5.0.10/libfreeb13.so .  Having libfreeb13.so in /usr/lib allows evolution to start ... removing it prevents it from starting.  This fix is from the centos bugs tracker and mailing list:  <http://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=1694>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c3)  Homayoun Shahri    2007-02-25 21:12:16 UTC  ``` I have exactly the same issue. After the latest rhn update evolution failed to start. I did as suggested by Johnny (thanks), and got evolution to start.  This is very urgent, as I am sure many other people are running into the same issue, and are completely lost as I!     ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c5)  Johnny Hughes    2007-02-26 07:25:08 UTC  ``` OK ... that file name should have a "lowercase L" (l) not a one (1) ...  cd /usr/lib ln -s firefox-1.5.0.10/libfreebl3.so      ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c6)  Mark J. Cox    2007-02-26 11:17:36 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 230048](show_bug.cgi?id=230048 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Latest seamonkey update breaks evolution") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=229987#c7)  Mark J. Cox    2007-02-26 11:49:39 UTC  ``` libfreebl3.so is new to NSS3.11 and it is dlopened by libsoftokn3.so.  Therefore the seamonkey-nss library should be shipping libfreebl3.so in /usr/lib (and not in the seamonkey main rpm).

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2014

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2014

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 144 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2014 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1594621.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_adf.ctrl-state=7zc236l82_4880&id=1594621.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_adf.ctrl-state=7zc236l82_4885&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 36 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.
34 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication,
i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.
The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2014verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 release.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=82515731195137&id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

# Mozilla Network Security Service: Remote execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200703-22**

The Mozilla Network Security Services libraries are vulnerable to two
buffer overflows that could result in the remote execution of arbitrary
code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/nss** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.11.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.11.5** |

### Background

The Mozilla Network Security Service is a library implementing security
features like SSL v2/v3, TLS, PKCS #5, PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12,
S/MIME and X.509 certificates.

### Description

iDefense has reported two potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities
found by researcher "regenrecht" in the code implementing the SSLv2
protocol.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted SSL master key to a
server using NSS for the SSLv2 protocol, or entice a user to connect to
a malicious server with a client-side application using NSS like one of
the Mozilla products. This could trigger the vulnerabilities and result
in the possible execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the
vulnerable application.

### Workaround

Disable the SSLv2 protocol in the applications using NSS.

### Resolution

All NSS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/nss-3.11.5"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

It creates .pyc (compiled bytecode python) files if they don't already exist.  This could very well happen whenever a python module is imported.  You may want to play with this. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Geert Bevin    2002-01-15 06:45:32 UTC  ``` See sandbox python modules [bug #44](show_bug.cgi?id=44 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"apparent\" sandbox violations when merging python modules") ``` |  |

## Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) fails to properly handle the client master key

#### Vulnerability Note VU#592796

Original Release Date: 2007-03-07 | Last Revised: 2007-04-05

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) handles the client master key may lead to execution of arbitrary code.

### Description

| The [SSLv2](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/ssl/draft02.html) protocol uses a client master key to generate all subsequent session keys. The validity of the client master key is determined during phase one of the SSL handshake. Mozilla [NSS](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/) library contains a vulnerability in the way client master keys with invalid length values are handled that may result in a buffer overflow. According to the Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory (MFSA) [2007-06](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2006/mfsa2007-06.html):  *Servers that use NSS for the SSLv2 protocol can be exploited by a client that presents a "Client Master Key" with invalid length values in any of several fields that are used without adequate error checking. This can lead to a buffer overflow that presumably could be exploitable.*Note that this vulnerability may affect any application that uses the Mozilla NSS library. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user who is running the vulnerable application or cause a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**According to the Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory [2007-06](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2007/mfsa2007-06.html), this vulnerability is addressed in [Firefox 2.0.0.2](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0.0.2/releasenotes/), [Firefox 1.5.0.10](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/releases/1.5.0.10.html), [SeaMonkey 1.0.8](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/releases/), and [NSS 3.11.5](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/). |
| --- |

| **Disable SSLv2**  Disabling support for the SSLv2 protocol appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Instructions for disabling the SSLv2 protocol support in Firefox and Thunderbird can be found in the Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory [2007-06](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2007/mfsa2007-06.html). SSLv2 is disabled by default in Firefox 2. |

This vulnerability was reported to security@mozilla.org by email from
vendor-disclosure@idefense.com, bearing the subject IDEF1994. It says:
"This vulnerability was reported to iDefense by regenrecht."
According to the report, NSS "may allow an attacker to cause a stack-based
buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code on the affected application."
The described attack occurs in SSL2 processing, in code executed only by
processes acting as SSL2 servers. This vulnerability does not affect clients.
Disabling SSL2 is believed to be a complete defense. Products with SSL2
disabled are believed to be not at risk from this vulnerability.
As of this writihg, the bug is not yet confirmed. More details will be
provided if/when it is confirmed.

We can do without the variable 'keySize' by rewriting this as
if (keyBits != ssl\_Specs[cipher].keyLen \*BPB) {
which looks similar to the checks for ckLen and caLen below.

I suggest that you restore the comment that you omitted.
Why did you mark this comment XXX?
>+ if (ekLen > modulusLen || ekLen + ckLen < keySize) {
If modulusLen equals -1 above, we set modulusLen to ekLen. In
that case, the test ekLen > modulusLen is useless, so ekLen can
be arbitrarily large.
So I suggest that we add another check here, e.g.,
if (ekLen > modulusLen || ekLen > 512 || ekLen + ckLen < keySize) {
(512 bytes = 4096 bits. I haven't seen a larger RSA modulus used
in practice. You can also use 1024 instead.)
Can you explain the ekLen + ckLen < keySize test? Can we use
ekLen + ckLen != keySize instead?

Let's consider not verifying cheaply.

Please ignore my previous comment about doing without the
variable 'keySize'. I was wrong.

We should be able to just fail if we can't get the modulusLen. It means either the key isn't an RSA key (we should have failed earlier), or the PKCS #11 module is just hosed. Since this is server only code, it's highly unlikely that any PKCS #11 module for a hardware accellerate would not return the modulus for the private key.

patch v1 (checked in)
r+ We should probably add some of the bug comments to the code. In particular why ekLen check was needed. The PKCS #11 module will check ekLen, but only to make sure it is big enough to hold the modulus.
Also if we are worried about the modulus check, it's OK to call PK11PubDecryptRaw with a too big ekLen, You can use the returned ddLen value to determine the real modulus size. Our current check of moduluslen and ddLen is a sanity check on the underlying PKCS #11 module (That is, it doesn't matter what data is passed by the attacker, the PKCS #11 module will always return 'moduluslen' data for ddLen unless the module itself is broken).

Improve checking of received SSL2 records.

On branch:
Checking in sslcon.c; new revision: 1.28.2.7; previous revision: 1.28.2.6
Wan-Teh, to answer some of your questions:
modulusLen is signed because it is assigned a value from function
PK11\_GetPrivateModulusLen which may return -1, and we test for the value -1.
I incorporated most of your other suggested changes, including testint ekLen
for an upper bound of 1024 (the limit currently imposed in freebl).
I'm willing to include a stronger check on the RSA block format, but have
not yet done so.

The Mozilla team would like this fix (or more specifically the fix for [bug 364319](/show_bug.cgi?id=364319 "RESOLVED FIXED - SSL2 client vulnerability in non-DEBUG builds")) in our upcoming 2.0.0.2 and 1.5.0.10 releases. Now, however, we've changed to pulling NSS by NSS-approved tags rather than just adding patches to a client branch -- overall a good thing, but are there plans to create a supported NSS tag with this patch included in the near future?Flags: blocking1.8.1.2?Flags: blocking1.8.1.2+Flags: blocking1.8.0.10?Flags: blocking1.8.0.10+

Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
