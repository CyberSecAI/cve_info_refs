| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=368655#c0)• 18 years ago |
|  | |

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2pre) Gecko/20070128 BonEcho/2.0.0.2pre
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2pre) Gecko/20070128 BonEcho/2.0.0.2pre
Firefox allows javascript scheme in src attribute of img element.
Current branch nightlies can nothing because of [Bug 344890](/show_bug.cgi?id=344890 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - <img src=\"javascript:alert(...);\"> gives \"Permission denied to get property Window.alert\"") (there are no window object), but the script runs even if I disable JavaScript.
(sorry, I can't test with trunk)
And if there is an infinite loop in this script, the "script runs slowly" dialog does not shown.
Tested and occurs on Firefox 2.0.0.2pre/20070128/WinMe and 1.5.0.10pre/20070129/WinMe.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try URL above.
Actual Results:
Firefox hangs.
Expected Results:
At least, the "script runs slowly" dialog appears.
I want to ask Mozilla folks: why do you allow javascript scheme in src attribute of img element? According to [Bug 179793 comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=179793#c0 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Image loaded via src=\"javascript:foo()\" fails to load"), this feature is for the compatibility with Netscape4 and Windows IE 6. Opera 9.10 allow this (but Opera doesn't hangs whole applicaiton), but I've heard of that Windows IE7 doesn't allow this. I think this /feature/ is not needed at all.

Oooh, yeah. I bet this is a regression from [bug 351370](/show_bug.cgi?id=351370 "VERIFIED FIXED - XSS by setting img.src to javascript: URL").

This makes sure to not execute javascript: URIs if script is disabled for the page, even if we were going to execute them in a sandbox.

Sorry about the lag here. I was kinda busy for a bit, and the answer for branches is not exactly trivial.
So all that this method wants out of a principal is to check whether it's chrome, and if not to check whether its URI is in a whitelist (about:, about:neterror, that sort of thing).
So I think it should be safe enough to use the about:blank principal. I'll comment accordingly in the patch coming up.

On 2.0.0.2pre 2007020204, when I open URI above, the "script runs slowly"
dialog appears (thank you for fixing [Bug 368714](/show_bug.cgi?id=368714 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Sandbox evaluation should handle branch callbacks")).
When I disable JS on a page by using CAPS, the script still runs. Is this intended? I made a simple test for this.

> When I disable JS on a page by using CAPS
You mean the "javascript" policy for the page?
It's somewhat "intended" in that we don't really know who started the load. So we don't know which CAPS policy is relevant. I suppose we could check whether script is enabled in general (for the about:blank principal) and if it is also check for the principal of the target context. I'm not sure whether that gets us very far (e.g. I think you can work around that by getting an image from a subframe, then loading a different page in the subframe, so the target context is no longer from your domain), and I'm not sure how commonly the CAPS thing is even used (unlike the general "disable javascript" option, which does work now).
The real way to fix that is to track principals for all javascript: loads and not execute the script at all if we don't have an origin principal. That's what I'd like to aim to do for 1.9...

Verified on branches and trunk. 1509 and 2001 would hang on the url on top. Now after a few seconds you get: "A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete", and you get the option to Stop or Continue.

Juan, that's the verification for [bug 368714](/show_bug.cgi?id=368714 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Sandbox evaluation should handle branch callbacks"), not the patch that landed in this bug. To verify this bug you need to disable JavaScript in your browser and then verify that this script doesn't execute at all....

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=230733#c0)  Josh Bressers    2007-03-02 15:45:50 UTC  ``` A bug was found in the way Thunderbird handles <img> tags.  To quote the upstream bug:  When javascript: url is set by script, the access checks work properly.    <img id="i">   i.src = "javascript:...";  But, when javascript: url is set by <img> (or <link>, <style>) tag, the access checks don't work properly.    <img src="javascript:...">  Thus, sandboxed script can access xbl.method's clone parent and xbl compilation scope to run arbitrary code with chrome privileges.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=230733#c1)  Josh Bressers    2007-03-02 18:08:13 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=230733#c2)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-03-02 18:28:46 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0078.html>    ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=230733#c3)  Josh Bressers    2007-03-06 19:48:14 UTC  ``` This flaw does not affect Thunderbird as previously thought.

Package        : mozilla-firefox
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-1282 CVE-2007-0994 CVE-2007-0995 CVE-2007-0996 CVE-2007-0981 CVE-2007-0008 CVE-2007-0009 CVE-2007-0775 CVE-2007-0778 CVE-2007-0045 CVE-2006-6077

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox.

This will be the last security update of Mozilla-based products for
the oldstable (sarge) distribution of Debian. We recommend to upgrade
to stable (etch) as soon as possible.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:

CVE-2007-1282

    It was discovered that an integer overflow in text/enhanced message
    parsing allows the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0994

    It was discovered that a regression in the Javascript engine allows
    the execution of Javascript with elevated privileges.

CVE-2007-0995

    It was discovered that incorrect parsing of invalid HTML characters
    allows the bypass of content filters.

CVE-2007-0996

    It was discovered that insecure child frame handling allows cross-site
    scripting.

CVE-2007-0981

    It was discovered that Firefox handles URI withs a null byte in the
    hostname insecurely.

CVE-2007-0008

    It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the NSS code allows the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0009

    It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the NSS code allows the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0775

    It was discovered that multiple programming errors in the layout engine
    allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0778

    It was discovered that the page cache calculates hashes in an insecure
    manner.

CVE-2006-6077

    It was discovered that the password manager allows the disclosure of
    passwords.

For the oldstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-2sarge17. You should upgrade to etch as soon as possible.

The stable distribution (etch) isn't affected. These vulnerabilities have
been fixed prior to the release of Debian etch.

The unstable distribution (sid) no longer contains mozilla-firefox. Iceweasel
is already fixed.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2007-09

## Privilege escalation by setting img.src to javascript: URI

Announced
March 5, 2007
Reporter
moz\_bug\_r\_a4
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.5.0.10
* Firefox 2.0.0.2
* SeaMonkey 1.0.8
* SeaMonkey 1.1.1

### Description

**moz\_bug\_r\_a4** reports that the fix for
[MFSA 2006-72](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2006/mfsa2006-72.html) in Firefox 1.5.0.9 and Firefox 2.0.0.1
introduced a regression that allows scripts from web content
to execute arbitrary code by setting the `src`
attribute of an `IMG` tag to a specially crafted
javascript: URI.

The same regression also caused javascript: URIs in
`IMG` tags to be executed even if JavaScript
execution was disabled in the global preferences. This facet was
noted by moz\_bug\_r\_a4 and reported independently by
**Anbo Motohiko**.

Thunderbird is not affected by this flaw as it will not execute
javascript: URIs in `IMG` tags.

### Workaround

Upgrade to a version containing the fix. Disabling JavaScript does
not protect against this flaw.

[testcase](attachment.cgi?id=253418)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=253418&action=edit)

This is very similar to [bug 363594](/show_bug.cgi?id=363594 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Arbitrary code execution by using javascript: url"). This affects only 1.8/1.8.0 branches.
When javascript: url is set by script, the access checks work properly.
<img id="i">
i.src = "javascript:...";
But, when javascript: url is set by <img> (or <link>, <style>) tag, the access
checks don't work properly.
<img src="javascript:...">
Thus, sandboxed script can access xbl.method's clone parent and xbl compilation
scope to run arbitrary code with chrome privileges.
Note:
Disabling JavaScript does \*not\* block this exploit. Because, javascript: url
can be evaluated even when JavaScript is disabled. (this issue seems to be
fixed in [bug 368655](/show_bug.cgi?id=368655 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Easy DoS by <img src=\"javascript:for(;;);\"> even if javascript disabled"), according to a CVS Log.)

Boris: Have you had a chance to look at this yet? Do you want me to take it? If so, can you give me a hint where to start looking (if this works along the same lines as the other bug, I assume it is in browser code, not spidermonkey)?

I didn't even realize this bug existed -- none of the changes made on it so far are things I get bugmail for. So I haven't looked, no.
As for where to start looking... At this point, the javascript: URI on branch is run in a sandbox with a made-up principal. So I'd suspect the bug is elsewhere.
I'd probably start with a breakpoint in EvalInSandboxObject, when I get there set a breakpoint in nsScriptSecurityManager::CheckPropertyAccessImpl, wait until the property in question comes through and see what's going on.... Of course if that property never comes through CheckPropertyAccessImpl that'll narrow down things right there. ;)

This does not work when JavaScript is disabled. And, this is almost the same
as the testcase in [bug 363594](/show_bug.cgi?id=363594 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Arbitrary code execution by using javascript: url").

FF2.0/1.5.0.8 are fine, FF2.0.0.1 is affected (I'll assume 1.5.0.9 as well for now, but will check in a bit).

So finally had time to sit down and read this bug and more importantly the testcase. Sounds to me like we just need to land the patch for [bug 363594](/show_bug.cgi?id=363594 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Arbitrary code execution by using javascript: url") on the branches, no?
Unfortunately, it's been a while since I built branch, so I won't be able to test for a bit. But I'll post a patch if someone is willing to test.

Actually, it's not quite so simple, and I'm not as convinced that the fix for [bug 363594](/show_bug.cgi?id=363594 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Arbitrary code execution by using javascript: url") is correct.
The reason [bug 363594](/show_bug.cgi?id=363594 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Arbitrary code execution by using javascript: url") is trunk-only is that in that case we were evaluating the JS async, so the caller cx was no longer on the context stack.
All well and good, but fixing that by pushing the \_target\_ cx on the context stack (as we did) only works as long as the target is not itself privileged in some way. If push comes to shove, we should just land the patch I'll attach (port of [bug 363594](/show_bug.cgi?id=363594 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Arbitrary code execution by using javascript: url") to branches) because it's better than nothing, but it's not perfect.
Ideally, we would push on the stack the same JSContext that the sandbox used for evaluation. Failing that, we should probably create a vanilla context with the sandbox object as its global, etc, just like EvalInSandboxObject() ends up doing.

This will fix this specific testcase.... At least with this, getting UniversalXPConnect involves getting your hands on a window whose global has UniversalXPConnect and then doing the load in some object connected with that window....

So I considered just doing a JS\_NewContext here. But then we'd either need a bunch of code to make sure that [bug 368714](/show_bug.cgi?id=368714 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Sandbox evaluation should handle branch callbacks") stays fixed or we'd allow infinite loops in toString/valueOf to hang the app. :(
I suppose we could more or less copy/paste the ContextHolder class into this code...

regression between 1.5.0.8/2.0 and 1.5.0.9/2.0.0.1. Although fixed by the patch for trunk [bug 363594](/show_bug.cgi?id=363594 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Arbitrary code execution by using javascript: url"), the blame for that regression was laid on trunk-only [bug 351633](/show_bug.cgi?id=351633 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Make javascript: URI execution async").

There is a check-in by jst that looks like the likely cause, it doesn't have a bug number associated with it, but I think it's [bug 351370](/show_bug.cgi?id=351370 "VERIFIED FIXED - XSS by setting img.src to javascript: URL").
So I think the branch patch for [bug 351370](/show_bug.cgi?id=351370 "VERIFIED FIXED - XSS by setting img.src to javascript: URL") was the branch regressor.

I filed [bug 372075](/show_bug.cgi?id=372075 "RESOLVED FIXED - javascript: URI evaluation should use sandboxed context for toString, etc") on [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=368763#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution by using javascript: url with <img> tag"). I think we should fix it for the next security release, but I'm not sure I'll be able to work on it... :(

(In reply to [comment #24](/show_bug.cgi?id=368763#c24 "VERIFIED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution by using javascript: url with <img> tag"))
> Because of [bug 368655](/show_bug.cgi?id=368655 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Easy DoS by <img src=\"javascript:for(;;);\"> even if javascript disabled") this one affects Thunderbird and SeaMonkey mail even with
> JavaScript disabled by default.
I was wrong: Thunderbird will not run a javascript: url in an img.src whether javascript is enabled or not. I suspected the remote content filter (since that whitelists only http(s) and ftp) but they're not run even if you load remote images.
I have not tested SeaMonkey mail.

By the way, is this a bugzilla's bug?
I couldn't see [comment #24](/show_bug.cgi?id=368763#c24 "VERIFIED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution by using javascript: url with <img> tag") until after [comment #27](/show_bug.cgi?id=368763#c27 "VERIFIED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution by using javascript: url with <img> tag") has been added. And now I
cannot see [comment #25](/show_bug.cgi?id=368763#c25 "VERIFIED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution by using javascript: url with <img> tag").

Does bugzilla keep track of private comment flags? I see nothing about them in the bug history, but [comment 24](/show_bug.cgi?id=368763#c24 "VERIFIED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution by using javascript: url with <img> tag") used to be private. Now [comment 25](/show_bug.cgi?id=368763#c25 "VERIFIED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution by using javascript: url with <img> tag") is. If someone twiddled the flags, that would make sense...

pvnick is doing a bit of research on XSS and also gathering up bugs with security related test cases to help add to the regression/certification test suites. adding him to the cc list in these...

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
