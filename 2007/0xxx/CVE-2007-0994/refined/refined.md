  "CVE-2007-0994": {
    "description": "A vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey allows execution of arbitrary code via a javascript: URI in the src attribute of an IMG tag. This occurs because access checks are bypassed when the javascript: URL is set by the IMG tag, as opposed to when it's set by script. This also allows the execution of javascript: URIs even when JavaScript is disabled in global preferences.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Mozilla Firefox",
      "SeaMonkey"
     ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a regression in the JavaScript engine that allows the execution of JavaScript with elevated privileges when a `javascript:` URI is used in the `src` attribute of an `<img>` tag. This bypasses intended access checks.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect handling of javascript: URIs in IMG tags",
        "Bypass of access checks",
        "Execution of JavaScript even when disabled"
       ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with chrome privileges. This can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to, data theft, system compromise, or installation of malware.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious web page containing an IMG tag with a javascript: URI as its source.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted web page to a user of the vulnerable application. No special user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability other than the ability to browse a malicious web page."
    },
    "remediation": "The vulnerability has been addressed in Firefox 1.5.0.10, Firefox 2.0.0.2, SeaMonkey 1.0.8, and SeaMonkey 1.1.1. Users should upgrade to one of these versions or a later version.",
