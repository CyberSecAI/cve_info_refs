# Squid: Multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities — GLSA **200701-22**

Two vulnerabilities have been found in Squid which make it susceptible to
Denial of Service attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-proxy/squid** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.6.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.6.7** |

### Background

Squid is a multi-protocol proxy server.

### Description

Squid fails to correctly handle ftp:// URI's. There is also an error in
the external\_acl queue which can cause an infinite looping condition.

### Impact

An attacker could attempt to retrieve a specially crafted URI via a
Squid server causing the service to crash. If an attacker could
generate a sufficiently high load on the Squid services, they could
cause a Denial of Service by forcing Squid into an infinite loop.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Squid users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-proxy/squid-2.6.7"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-414-1: Squid vulnerabilities

25 January 2007

Squid vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

David Duncan Ross Palmer and Henrik Nordstrom discovered that squid

incorrectly handled special characters in FTP URLs. Remote users with

access to squid could crash the server leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2007-0247](/security/CVE-2007-0247))

Erick Dantas Rotole and Henrik Nordstrom discovered that squid could end

up in an endless loop when exhausted of available external ACL helpers.

Remote users with access to squid could cause CPU starvation, possibly

leading to a denial of service. This does not affect a default Ubuntu

installation, since external ACL helpers must be configured and used.

([CVE-2007-0248](/security/CVE-2007-0248))

## 1. [Key changes from squid 2.5](#toc1)

* Major improvements to the way that Squid handles web proxy, accelerated
  and transparent proxy requests to make it easier to configure transparent and
  acceleration functionality. The default behaviour is to function as a standard
  HTTP proxy on each port that Squid is configured to listen on, but in addition
  in this release the keywords "accelerated" and "transparent" can be specified
  after each port to indicate to Squid the functionality that is to be enabled on
  that port. This means that the old config directives relating to httpd\_accel\_\*
  are now deprecated.
* WCCPv2 support multiple cache engines registering with multiple WCCP
  routers and switches. WCCPv2 is preferred over WCCPv1 for performance and
  flexibility reasons if your router or switch is able to support it (all recent
  versions of IOS do so). Initially WCCPv2 under Linux is limited to registration
  with only one router due to kernel limitations in more recent versions, although
  this will be addressed in a future release of Squid.
* TPROXY totally transparent proxy support under Linux, which to allow Squid
  to appear totally invisible to both client and server systems when transparently
  caching requests. This works by spoofing the source and destination address to
  both the client and server.
* Support for Etag and Vary HTTP headers. This further moves Squid towards
  HTTP/1.1 compliance. The Vary header field is used for improved caching and
  delivery of customized content to end clients, and the Etag is used similar to
  an MD5 checksum between client and server to determine if a web page has changed
  since it was last retrieved.
* Collapsed forwarding, which gives Squid the ability to intelligently merge
  client requests for objects into one request to the server. Of particular
  benefit in accelerator setups but also provides some benefits to non accelerator
  setups.
* Support for epoll under Linux and kqueue under FreeBSD, which gives Squid
  the ability to handle many many more concurrent requests with lower CPU
  overhead. This feature is of particular benefit to very busy caches
  as the poll() and select() routines do not scale anywhere near as well as epoll
  and kqueue does under high loads.
* SSL assisted hardware encryption making use of OpenSSL functionality
  within Squid.
* Logging enhancements to allow even greater customization of the way Squid
  logs requests in the access-log or to syslog if required
* Authentication enhancements including Negotiate/Kerberos support, extra
  workarounds for NTLM clients and others using Microsoft Integrated Login.
* Additional external\_acl parameters to support SSL and even more client
  side parameters.
* ACL changes in conjunction with SSL changes which have been merged, to
  allow matching based on SSL certificate parameters.
* Improvements to Cygwin support for users who wish to run Squid in a
  Microsoft Windows/Cygwin environment as a system service.
* New authentication helpers:
  + Digest LDAP helper
  + Native Windows basic, NTLM and negotiate helpers
  + External acl helpers for session monitoring and native Windows group
    membership check
* HTCP significantly cleaned up and added support for the CLR operation to purge contents from the cache
* Support for parsing X-Forwarded-For headers allowing access controls to be based on the real client IP even if behind secondary proxies

## 2. [Changes to squid.conf](#toc2)

**http\_port**

Now takes a list of options in addition to the port address, specifying the purpose of this http\_port. Default is plain Internet proxy as usual.

**httpd\_accel\_\* for transparent proxy**

Now implemented by the "transparent" http\_port option

**httpd\_accel\_host**

Replaced by defaultsite http\_port option and cache\_peer originserver option.

**httpd\_accel\_port**

No longer needed. Server port defined by the cache\_peer port.

**httpd\_accel\_uses\_host\_header**

**cache**

New name for the old no\_cache directive.

**cache\_vary**

New directive to disable caching of Vary:ing responses

**broken\_vary\_encoding**

New directive to work around known broken compression modules which hasn't understood the meaning of the ETag HTTP header in relation to Accept-Encoding.

**logformat**

New directive for defining custom log formats

**cache\_access\_log**

Renamed to access\_log

**access\_log**

Select what requests to log where any by what format. Support for multiple log files and multiple log formats.

**check\_hostnames**

New option to disable the hostname validity/sanity checks usually performed by Squid, replacing the similar build time configure option in 2.5.

**allow\_underscore**

New option to allow \_ in hostnames, replacing the similar build time configure option in 2.5 and earlier.

**dns\_defnames**

Allow for domain searches. Now possible even when using the internal DNS client

**redirect\_\***

Renamed to url\_rewrite\_\* to better reflect the functionality of this helper (rewriting requested URLs)

**url\_rewrite\_concurrency**

Activates a new and more efficient helper protocol. Requires changes in the helper.

**location\_rewrite\_\***

New helper hook for rewriting Location headers

**auth\_param basic blankpassword**

New option to allow the use of blank passwords.

**auth\_param basic/digest concurrency**

**refresh\_pattern**

Several new HTTP override/ignore options

**read\_ahead\_gap**

New directive to set the response buffer size.

**collapsed\_forwarding**

New directive to enable an alternative optimized forwarding path when there is very many concurrent requests for the same URL.

**refresh\_stale\_hit**

New directive similar to collapsed\_forwarding and activates an alternative optimized request processing when there is very many concurrent requests for the same recently expired URL.

## 5. [Other issues](#toc5)

Ipfilter 4.x compile problem on HP Tru64

* Running configure --enable-ipf-transparent on an HP Tru64 5.1B system with ipfilter 4.x installed, the following error can occur:
  ```

        checking if IP-Filter header files are installed... no
        WARNING: Cannot find necessary IP-Filter header files
                 Transparent Proxy support WILL NOT be enabled

  ```
  To fix the problem first check if the ip\_fil.h, ip\_compat.h, ip\_nat.h and ipl.h files are present in
  /usr/include/netinet and copy them from ipfilter source tree if needed.
  Don't forget to fix files permission and ownership after the copy.

  If the error still persist, run configure making it skip the ip\_compat.h test:
  ```

      env ac_cv_header_netinet_ip_compat_h=yes ./configure --enable-ipf-transparent

  ```
* On Sun Solaris 10, ipfilter 4.0.22 is provided with the OS, but related include files (ip\_fil.h, ip\_compat.h, ip\_nat.h, ipl.h) are missing.

  Before running configure --enable-ipf-transparent, they must be downloaded from the
  [OpenSolaris Web Site](http://cvs.opensolaris.org/source/xref/usr/src/common/ipf/)
  in the /usr/include local directory. Don't forget to fix files permission and ownership after the download.

## 6. [Windows support](#toc6)

This Squid version can run on Windows as a system service using the Cygwin emulation environment,
or can be compiled in Windows native mode using the MinGW + MSYS development environment. Windows NT 4 SP4 and later are supported.

On Windows 2000 and later the service is configured to use the Windows Service Recovery option
restarting automatically after 60 seconds.
**Usage**

Some new command line options was added for the Windows service support:

The service installation is made with -i command line switch, it's possible to use -f switch at
the same time for specify a different config-file settings for the Squid Service that will be
stored on the Windows Registry.

A new -n switch specify the Windows Service Name, so multiple Squid instance are allowed.
*"Squid"* is the default when the switch is not used.

So, to install the service, the syntax is:

```

squid -i [-f file] [-n name]

```

Service uninstallation is made with -r command line switch with the appropriate -n switch.

The -k switch family must be used with the appropriate -f and -n switches, so the syntax is:

```

squid -k command [-f file] -n service-name

```
where *service-name* is the name specified with -n options at service install time.

To use the Squid original command line, the new -O switch must be used ONCE, the syntax is:

```

squid -O cmdline [-n service-name]

```
If multiple service command line options must be specified, use quote. The -n switch is
needed only when a non default service name is in use.

Don't use the "Start parameters" in the Windows 2000/XP/2003 Service applet: they are
specific to Windows services functionality and Squid is not designed for understand they.

In the following example the command line of the "squidsvc" Squid service is set to "-D -u 3130":

```

squid -O "-D -u 3130" -n squidsvc

```

**PSAPI.DLL (Process Status Helper) Considerations**

The process status helper functions make it easier for you to obtain information about
processes and device drivers running on Microsoft® Windows NT®/Windows® 2000. These
functions are available in PSAPI.DLL, which is distributed in the Microsoft® Platform
Software Development Kit (SDK). The same information is generally available through the
performance data in the registry, but it is more difficult to get to it. PSAPI.DLL is
freely redistributable.

PSAPI.DLL is available only on Windows NT, 2000, XP and 2003. The implementation in Squid is
aware of this, and try to use it only on the right platform.

On Windows NT PSAPI.DLL can be found as component of many applications, if you need it,
you can find it on Windows NT Resource KIT. If you have problem, it can be
downloaded from here:
<http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/Redist/4.0.1371.1/NT4/EN-US/psinst.EXE>

On Windows 2000 and later it is available installing the Windows Support Tools, located on the
Support\Tools folder of the installation Windows CD-ROM.

**Registry DNS lookup**

On Windows platforms, if no value is specified in the *dns\_nameservers* option on
squid.conf or in the /etc/resolv.conf file, the list of DNS name servers are
taken from the Windows registry, both static and dynamic DHCP configurations
are supported.

**Compatibility Notes**

* It's recommended to use '/' char in Squid paths instead of '\'
* Paths with spaces (like 'C:\Programs Files\Squid) are NOT supported by Squid
* When using ACL like 'acl aclname acltype "file"' the file must be in DOS text
  format (CR+LF) and the full Windows path must be specified, for example:
  ```

  acl blocklist url_regex -i "c:/squid/etc/blocked1.txt"

  ```
* The Windows equivalent of '/dev/null' is 'NUL'
* Squid doesn't know how to run external helpers based on scripts, like .bat, .cmd,
  .vbs, .pl, etc. So in squid.conf the interpreter path must be always specified, for example:
  ```

  redirect_program c:/perl/bin/perl.exe c:/squid/libexec/redir.pl
  redirect_program c:/winnt/system32/cmd.exe /C c:/squid/libexec/redir.cmd

  ```
* When Squid runs in command line mode, the launching user account must have administrative privilege on the system
* "Start parameters" in the Windows 2000/XP/2003 Service applet cannot be used
* Building with MinGW, when the configure option --enable-truncate is used, Squid cannot run on Windows NT, only Windows 2000 and later are supported

**Known Limitations:**

* Squid features not operational:
  + DISKD: still needs to be ported
  + WCCP: cannot work because user space GRE support on Windows is missing
  + Transparent Proxy: missing Windows non commercial interception driver
* Some code sections can make blocking calls.
* Some external helpers may not work.
* File Descriptors number hard-limited to 2048 when building with MinGW.

**Building Squid on Windows:**

A reasonably recent release of
[Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) or
[MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) is needed.

The usage of the Cygwin environment is very similar to other Unix/Linux environments, and -devel version of libraries must be installed.

For the MinGW environment, the packages MSYS, MinGW and msysDTK must be installed. Some additional libraries and tools must be downloaded separately:

OpenSSL:
[Shining Light Productions Win32 OpenSSL](http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)

libcrypt:
[MinGW packages repository](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingwrep/)

db-1.85:
[TinyCOBOL download area](http://tinycobol.org/download.html)

uudecode:
[Native Win32 ports of some GNU utilities](http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/)

When running configure, --disable-wccp and --disable-wccpv2 options should always specified to avoid compile errors.

* New configure options:
  + --enable-win32-service
* Updated configure options:
  + --enable-arp-acl
  + --enable-default-hostsfile
* Unsupported configure options:
  + --enable-coss-aio-ops: On Windows Posix AIO is not available
  + --with-large-files: No suitable build environment is available on both Cygwin and MinGW, but --enable-large-cache-files works fine
* Recommended configure minimal options for Windows:
  + --prefix=c:/squid --disable-wccp --disable-wccpv2 --enable-win32-service --enable-default-hostsfile=none

Before build Squid with SSL support, some operations are needed (in the following example OpenSSL is installed in C:\OpenSSL and MinGW in C:\MinGW):

* Copy C:\OpenSSL\lib\MinGW content to C:\MinGW\lib
* Copy C:\OpenSSL\include\openssl content to C:\MinGW\include\openssl
* Rename C:\MinGW\lib\ssleay32.a to C:\MinGW\lib\libssleay32.a

**Using cache manager on Windows:**

On Windows, cache manager (cachemgr.cgi) can be used with Microsoft IIS or Apache.

Some specific configuration could be needed:

* IIS 6 (Windows 2003):
  + On IIS 6.0 all CGI extensions are denied by default for security reason, so the following configuration is needed:
    - Create a cgi-bin Directory
    - Define the cgi-bin IIS Virtual Directory with read and CGI execute IIS
      permissions, ASP scripts are not needed. This automatically defines a
      cgi-bin IIS web application
    - Copy cachemgr.cgi into cgi-bin directory and look to file permissions:
      the IIS system account and SYSTEM must be able to read and execute the file
    - In IIS manager go to Web Service extensions and add a new Web Service
      Extension called *"Squid Cachemgr"*, add the cachemgr.cgi file and set the
      extension status to *Allowed*
* Apache:
  + On Windows, cachemgr.cgi needs to create a temporary file, so Apache must be instructed
    to pass the TMP and TEMP Windows environment variables to CGI applications:
    ```

    ScriptAlias /squid/cgi-bin/ "c:/squid/libexec/"
    <Location /squid/cgi-bin/cachemgr.cgi>
        PassEnv TMP TEMP
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from workstation.example.com
    </Location>

    ```
