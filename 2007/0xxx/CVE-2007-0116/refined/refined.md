Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0116:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the exposure of a Microsoft Access database file named `intranet.mdb` located in a publicly accessible directory on a web server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the direct exposure of the `intranet.mdb` database file which is likely to contain sensitive data.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The web server configuration allows direct access to this database file, bypassing any intended access controls.
- **Sensitive Data Storage:** The use of an Access database, often without proper security measures, to store sensitive information such as passwords makes the system vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact (Partial):** An attacker can potentially access sensitive information contained within the database, including user credentials (passwords), internal system information, or other confidential data. This can lead to unauthorized access to systems or data controlled by the vulnerable application.
- **Integrity Impact (Partial):** While not a direct manipulation vulnerability, an attacker with access to the database might be able to modify its content, although this is not specified, leading to potential data integrity issues.
- **Availability Impact (Partial):** The disclosure of database credentials could potentially lead to compromise which may later affect the availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by directly accessing the exposed `.mdb` file via its URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker only needs network connectivity to access the web server hosting the vulnerable file.
- **No Authentication Required:** The exploit does not require any form of authentication, as the file is directly accessible via a URL.
- **Knowledge of File Location:** The attacker must know the URL path to the `intranet.mdb` file, which is revealed in the PoC, i.e., `http://victim.com/path/data/intranet.mdb`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.5, with a high exploitability subscore of 10.
- The report is attributed to the "Aria-Security Team".
- The affected vendor is associated with "diggersolutions.com."
