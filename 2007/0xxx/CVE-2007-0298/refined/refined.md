Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-0298:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of the `PollDir` parameter in the `show.php` script of LunarPoll 1.0. This allows an attacker to control the path used in the `require_once()` function calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes files specified by the attacker-controlled `PollDir` parameter without validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable LunarPoll application. This can lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out via a crafted HTTP request to `show.php`
- The `PollDir` parameter is modified to include a remote URL pointing to a malicious script.
  
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server running the vulnerable LunarPoll application.
- The attacker needs to have a server where they can host a malicious PHP script.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability lies in these lines of `show.php`:
```php
require_once($PollDir.'/includes/functions.php');
require_once($PollDir.'/includes/IO.php');
```
The `$PollDir` variable is directly taken from the GET parameter and is used to include other php files. By injecting a URL such as `http://attacker.txt?` in `PollDir`, the attacker can force the server to include and execute the malicious code contained in `attacker.txt`
