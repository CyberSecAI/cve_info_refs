{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from the interaction of optional client certificates (SSLVerifyClient set to 1 or 3) and the SSLFakeBasicAuth feature in Apache-SSL. When these configurations are combined, an attacker can use basic authentication to forge a client certificate.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that Apache-SSL versions prior to 1.3.29+1.53, when configured with optional client certificates and SSLFakeBasicAuth, do not properly validate client certificates. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended certificate verification and impersonate a valid user by providing a user's one-line DN and the fixed password.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can successfully impersonate a valid user, potentially gaining unauthorized access to resources or data. The attacker can forge a client certificate by using a valid user's one-line DN and the default password, bypassing the intended authentication mechanism.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the web interface when the server is configured with optional client certificates and SSLFakeBasicAuth enabled.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know the 'one-line DN' of a valid user as used by faked basic auth and the fixed password (default is 'password'). The attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable web server."
