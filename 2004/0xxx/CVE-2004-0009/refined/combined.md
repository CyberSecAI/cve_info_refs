Apache-SSL optional client certificate vulnerability
----------------------------------------------------

Synopsis
--------

If configured with SSLVerifyClient set to 1 or 3 (client certificates
optional) and SSLFakeBasicAuth, Apache-SSL 1.3.28+1.52 and all earlier
versions would permit a client to use real basic authentication to
forge a client certificate.

All the attacker needed is the "one-line DN" of a valid user, as used
by faked basic auth in Apache-SSL, and the fixed password ("password"
by default).

Fix
---

Install Apache-SSL 1.3.29+1.53 from the usual places (see
<http://www.apache-ssl.org/>).

Credits
-------

This vulnerability was found and reported by Wietse Venema.

cheers,
Adam

[iPhone recovery, help much appreciated](/r/DataRecoveryHelp/comments/1i96jpq/iphone_recovery_help_much_appreciated/)

[A friend of mine has an iPhone (a 13 pro I believe) and after a suspected bad update her phone has been locked in recovery mode with no way to unlock it. The on device data recovery option also failed and Apple has informed her there is nothing they can do despite having all the account information etc obviously. It’s bricked basically.

She didn’t have paid iCloud storage either and so little to no personal data is backed up. I have explained to her that (to my knowledge) it’s next to impossible to get her photos etc. back but I’d be happy to be wrong.

Any and all advice is welcome, she’s very upset about the loss of years worth of memories and I’d love to help her, but I’m prepared to be the bearer of bad news if there is nothing to be done. ALWAYS back up your data folks…

Thanks peeps.](/r/DataRecoveryHelp/comments/1i96jpq/iphone_recovery_help_much_appreciated/)

[How to recover a deleted file in windows 11(the file is very precious to be lost)](/r/DataRecoveryHelp/comments/1i8xnfb/how_to_recover_a_deleted_file_in_windows_11the/)

[I don't understand what's just happened.I had a very precious 13.5 GB file of pictures on my laptop(in d drive), so I decided to copy it to a USB flash drive as a backup (because I’ve had a few nasty similar instances in the past). So it started copying, it Said that it would take around 20 mins so I just opened valorant and go do some work but after I came I say that valo was minimized and copy/paste bar was not showing i thought it might have stopped due to some error so I checked file size in flash drive and it was 4.5 gb which less than half of the original . So i decided to delete the file in the flash drive and paste again .so I tried to delete the partially copied file on the USB drive but I saw in delete window that copying process is going. Since it was still in the middle of copying, the file didn’t delete.

I stopped the copying process and then deleted the partially copied file on the USB to start the process again. However, when I went back to the source location on my laptop, the original file was gone! It’s not in the Recycle Bin either.

I’m completely baffled and don’t understand what happened. Does anyone know where the file might have gone or how I can recover it? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

And I have not touched my laptop since as it could hinder any recovery ways.](/r/DataRecoveryHelp/comments/1i8xnfb/how_to_recover_a_deleted_file_in_windows_11the/)
