  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Anti-virus software may rely on corrupted headers within zip archives to determine their validity. An attacker can modify these headers to indicate that the archive contains files with zero size/length.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of zip archive headers.",
      "Reliance on header information to determine if an archive contains malicious content."

    "impact": "A remote attacker can craft a malicious zip archive that evades anti-virus detection. If a user extracts the contents of the malicious archive, the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious zip archive with modified headers that report zero length files.",
      "Social engineering to persuade a user to access/extract the malicious archive."

      "Ability to create and modify zip archive headers.",
