### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves a newly-discovered, privately reported vulnerability. A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Task Scheduler because of an unchecked buffer. The vulnerability is documented in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin.

If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**How does the extended support for Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition affect the release of security updates for these operating systems?**

Microsoft will only release security updates for critical security issues. Non-critical security issues are not offered during this support period. For more information about the Microsoft Support Lifecycle policies for these operating systems, visit the following [Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?pr=lifean1).

For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by any of the vulnerabilities that are addressed in this security bulletin?**

No. None of these vulnerabilities are critical in severity on Windows 98, on Windows 98 Second Edition, or on Windows Millennium Edition, even with Internet Explorer 6 SP1 installed.

**Is Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6a affected by the vulnerability that is addressed in this security bulletin?**

By default, this operating system does not natively provide a version of the vulnerable component and is not affected. However, the vulnerable component is installed on this operating system when you install Internet Explorer 6. If you use this version of Internet Explorer on this operating system, you should install the provided security update for Internet Explorer 6.

**I'm still using Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Service Pack 6a or Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, but extended security update support ended on June 30, 2004. However, this bulletin has a security update for these operating system versions. Why is that?**

Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Service Pack 6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 have reached the end of their life cycles as previously documented, and Microsoft extended this support to June 30, 2004. However, the end-of-life for the extended support period occurred very recently. In this case, the majority of the steps that are required to address this vulnerability were completed before June 30, 2004. Therefore, we have decided to release security updates for these operating system versions as part of this security bulletin. We do not anticipate doing this for future vulnerabilities affecting these operating system versions, but we reserve the right to produce updates and to make these updates available when necessary.

It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to future vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Life Cycle, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these operating system versions, visit the following [Microsoft Product Support Services Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;%5bln%5d;lifeanoct2003).

Customers who require additional support for Windows NT Workstation 4.0 SP6a must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/), select the country, and then click **Go** to see a list of phone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager.

For more information, see the [Windows Operating System FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;%5bln%5d;lifewinfaq).

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine if this update is required?**

MBSA will determine if this update is required for Windows 2000 (all versions) and Windows XP (all versions). MBSA does not currently support the full detection of this update for the Windows NT 4.0 product (all versions). For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**Note** After April 20, 2004, the Mssecure.xml file that is used by MBSA 1.1.1 and earlier versions is no longer being updated with new security bulletin data. Therefore, scans that are performed after that date with MBSA 1.1.1 or earlier will be incomplete. All users should upgrade to MBSA 1.2 because it provides more accurate security update detection and supports additional products. Users can download MBSA 1.2 from the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about MBSA support, visit the following [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer 1.2 Q&A; Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsaqa.mspx).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine if this update is required?**

SMS uses MBSA for detection. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update for Windows 2000 (all versions) and Windows XP (all versions). This update is not detected by MBSA for the Windows NT 4.0 product (all versions). However, the file and registry key information that is available in this bulletin can be used to write specific file and registry key collection queries in SMS to detect vulnerable computers. For information about how to deploy updates not supported by MBSA with SMS, please review Knowledge Base article [867832](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;867832&). For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

## Vulnerability Details

#### Task Scheduler Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0212:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Task Scheduler because of the way that it handles application name validation. There are many ways that a system could be vulnerable to this attack. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for Task Scheduler Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0212:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
* Windows Server 2003 is not affected by this vulnerability. Windows NT 4.0 is not vulnerable unless Internet Explorer 6 is installed. Internet Explorer 6 is not affected when installed on other supported operating systems. Other versions Internet Explorer are not affected.

#### Workarounds for Task Scheduler Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0212:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Do not open or save .job files that you receive from untrusted sources.**
  This vulnerability could be exploited when a user views a .job file. Do not open files that use this file name extension.
* **Disable the dynamic icon handler for JobObject files by clearing the default value in the following registry key:**
  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\JobObject\shellex\IconHandler

1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regedt32**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
2. In Registry Editor, locate the following registry key: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\JobObject\shellex\IconHandler
3. On the right windows pane you see a value of **Default** with **Data** of {DD2110F0-9EEF-11cf-8D8E-00AA0060F5BF}.
4. Right click on **Default** and select **Modify**.
5. Clear out the **Value Data** listed and click **OK**.

**Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

**Note** We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.

**Impact of Workaround:** Clearing the value of this key will prevent the possibility of attack by preventing the IconHandler from automatically parsing .job files. The files will no longer have an icon associated with them.

#### FAQ for Task Scheduler Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0212:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the Task Scheduler component.

**What is the Task Scheduler?**

You can use Task Scheduler to schedule commands, programs, or scripts to run at specific times. A task is saved as a file that has a .job file name extension. This behavior makes it easier to move the task information from system to system. Administrators can create scheduled maintenance task files and put them where needed. For more information, see the [Task Scheduler Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/evaluate/featfunc/taskschd.mspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

There are many ways that a system could be vulnerable to this attack. Here are some examples:

* An attacker could host a malicious Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site.
* An attacker could add a specially crafted .job file to the local file system or to a network share and then persuade the user to view the folder by using Windows Explorer.
* An attacker could also access the affected component through another vector. For example, an attacker could log on to the system interactively or by using another program that passes parameters to the vulnerable component (locally or remotely).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers are only at risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative credentials are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could attempt to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. Microsoft has provided information about how you can help protect your PC. End users can visit the [Protect Your PC Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21169). IT Professionals can visit the [Security Center Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21171).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Task Scheduler validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

For more information about dual-mode packages, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [328848](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=328848).

**Verifying Update Installation**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool, which allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results pane**, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name box**, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  For Windows XP Home Edition, Windows XP Professional, Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1, Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, and Windows XP Media Center Edition:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP2\KB841873\Filelist

  For Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP1\KB841873\Filelist

  **Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 841873 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows 2000 (all versions)

**Prerequisites**

**Verifying Update Installation**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool, which allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results pane**, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name box**, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB841873\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 841873 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Internet Explorer 6 for Windows NT 4.0 SP6a

**Prerequisites**

To install the Internet Explorer 6 version of this update, you must be running one of the following versions of Windows:

* Microsoft Windows NTÂ® Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a
* Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a
* Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, Service Pack 6

**Note** Versions of Windows and versions of Internet Explorer that are not listed in this article are no longer supported or not affected. We recommend that you upgrade to a supported version of Windows and of Internet Explorer, and then apply the appropriate update.

For more information about support lifecycles for Windows components, see the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

For more information about how to obtain the latest service pack for Internet Explorer 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [328548](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;328548).

**Installation Information**

The security update supports the following setup switches:

/**Q** Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.

/**Q:U** Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user.

/**Q:A** Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user.

/**T**: **<full path>** Specifies the target folder for extracting files.

/**C** Extracts the files without installing them. If /**T**: path is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder.

/**C**: **<Cmd>** Override Install Command defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup .inf or .exe file.

/**R:N** Never restarts the computer after installation.

/**R:I** Prompts the user to restart the computer if a restart is required, except when used with **/Q:A**.

/**R:A** Always restarts the computer after installation.

/**R:S** Restarts the computer after installation without prompting the user.

/**N:V** No version checking - Install the program over any previous version.

**Note** These switches do not necessarily work with all updates. If a switch is not available then that functionality is not necessary for the proper installation of the update. Also, the use of the **/N:V** switch is unsupported and may result in an unbootable system. If the installation is unsuccessful, you should consult your support professional to understand why it failed to install.

For additional information about the supported setup switches, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [197147](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;197147).

**Deployment Information**

For example, to install the update without any user intervention and not force the system to restart, run the following command:

**IE-KB841873-WindowsNT4sp6-x86-ENU.exe /q:a /r:n**

For information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21125).

**Restart Requirements**

In some cases, you do not have to restart your system after you apply this update. However, if the required files are in use, you must restart your system after you apply this update. If this behavior occurs, a message is displayed that advises you to restart your system. You do not have to use an administrator logon after the system restarts for any version of this update.

**Removal Information**

To remove this update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool (or the Add/Remove Programs tool) in Control Panel. Click **Internet Explorer Q841873**, and then click **Change/Remove** (or click **Add/Remove**).

System administrators can use the Ieuninst.exe utility to remove this update. This security update installs the Ieuninst.exe utility in the %Windir% folder. This utility supports the following setup switches:

/**?**: Show the list of supported switches

/**z**: Do not restart when the installation is complete

/**q**: Use Quiet mode (no user interaction)

For example, to remove this update without any user intervention, use the following command:

**c:\windows\ieuninst /q c:\windows\inf\q841873.inf**

**Note** This command assumes that Windows is installed in the C:\Windows folder.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and to perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, see the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/evaluation/capabilities/patch.mspx). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/20/featurepacks/suspack/) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, see the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sms/sms2003/patchupdate.mspx). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [**SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack**](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/sms/2003/downloads/featurepacks/adminpack.mspx) and in the [**SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack**](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/20/featurepacks/adminpack/)) to install these updates.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft Windows Task Scheduler Buffer Overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#228028

Original Release Date: 2004-07-14 | Last Revised: 2004-07-14

---

### Overview

Microsoft Windows Task Scheduler has a buffer overflow that may allow a remote or local intruder to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| Microsoft Windows Task Scheduler (Mstask.dll) is a COM-based API (ActiveX control) that provides a scheduling service for executing arbitrary commands on a system. It contains a buffer overflow that is reported to be caused by failing to properly check some attribute of the names of the commands the scheduler is tasked to execute. Exploitation of this overflow could allow an intruder to execute arbitrary code if the intruder can convince the victim to visit a malicious web page or, in some circumstances, open a malicious email message, or a file with the extension .JOB. For more information, see Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-022](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-022.mspx).  Microsoft Windows Server 2003 is reportedly not affected by this issue. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An intruder could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user logged into a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-022](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-022.mspx). |

NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: Microsoft Windows Task Scheduler '.job' Stack Overflow
Confirmed Systems Affected:  Microsoft Windows XP
Systems Reportedly Affected: Windows 2000 and Windows NT SP6 with
                             Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.
Severity: Critical
Vendor URL: <http://www.microsoft.com/>
Author: Peter Winter-Smith [ peter@ngssoftware.com ]
Date Vendor Notified: 6th May 2004
Date of Public Advisory: 13th July 2004
Advisory number: #NISR13072004
Advisory URL: <http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/mstaskjob.txt>

Description
***********

The Microsoft Windows operating system provides a service which is
designed to run a particular application at a given time or date - the
Task Scheduler. When a new task is added through the control panel
application, a '.job' file containing this information is created and
stored in the 'Tasks' folder in the Windows directory.

It has been found that it is possible to create a specially crafted '.job'
file which could allow local or remote code execution using a number of
different applications as the attack vectors.

Details
*******

By crafting a '.job' file which contains overly long parameters, stack
based buffers can be overflowed, resulting in critical information,
including a saved return address or a structured exception handler
structure being completely overwritten, allowing an attacker to direct
the code execution flow to an address of their choosing. If the file
contains arbitrary executable code, the process can be forced to execute
this allowing, in worst cases, complete control over the target system.

The actual vulnerability arises from a lack of boundary checking performed
when copying the information out of memory containing the contents of the
file into the stack based buffers.

In some circumstances the overflow is triggered automatically when
viewing the directory that contains the job file in an explorer window
due to the fact that 'shell32.dll' will detect the '.job' file extension,
and load 'mstask.dll' allowing the module to examine the file, which
is when the overflow occurs.

Due to the fact that the overflow is triggered by a module loaded within
the process space of another running executable, any code which would be
executed by exploiting this flaw will be run with the privileges of the
user running that application, in the most common cases this would be the
user logged on to the machine.

Two applications which have been successfully tested as vectors for
exploiting this issue are Windows Explorer and Internet Explorer - when
attempting to view network shares containing the '.job' file. File
sharing through MSN Messenger has also been proven to be an effective
vector for attack. In the case of Internet Explorer, this issue could be
exploited simply by viewing a website containing a frame pointing to a
network share containing the '.job' file. Please note that there are many
other ways of exploiting this issue, this is certainly not an exhaustive
list.
