{
    "CVE-2004-0718": {
        "Description": "A vulnerability has been discovered in Mozilla and Mozilla Firefox that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary Javascript from one page into the frameset of another site.  Thunderbird is not affected by this and Galeon will be automatically fixed as it uses Mozilla components.",
        "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from Mozilla's failure to properly prevent a frame from one domain from injecting content into a frame belonging to another domain.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Improper restriction of operations within the same domain, leading to cross-frame scripting attacks."
        ],
        "Impact": "A remote attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the frameset of another site, leading to website spoofing and potential execution of malicious code.",
        "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by loading a malicious page in a frame which then injects script into another frame of a different domain.",
		"Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to load a page into a frame of the vulnerable browser.",
        "Additional details": "The vulnerability is a regression of a previously fixed issue. Test cases were developed demonstrating the vulnerability using both target attributes and window.frames[n] access to frames. The fix requires changes to nsDocShell.cpp which handles frame loading permission checks and also nsHTMLFormElement.cpp to ensure that console errors appear when the exploit is attempted."
