How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : mozilla
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CAN-2004-0718 CAN-2005-1937 CAN-2005-2260 CAN-2005-2261
                 CAN-2005-2263 CAN-2005-2265 CAN-2005-2266 CAN-2005-2268

BugTraq ID     : 14242

Several problems have been discovered in Mozilla, the we browser of
the Mozilla suite.  Since the usual praxis of backporting apparently
does not work for this package, this update is basically version
1.7.10 with the version number rolled back, and hence still named
1.7.8.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CAN-2004-0718, CAN-2005-1937

    A vulnerability has been discovered in Mozilla that allows remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary Javascript from one page into the
    frameset of another site.

CAN-2005-2260

    The browser user interface does not properly distinguish between
    user-generated events and untrusted synthetic events, which makes
    it easier for remote attackers to perform dangerous actions that
    normally could only be performed manually by the user.

CAN-2005-2261

    XML scripts ran even when Javascript disabled.

CAN-2005-2263

    It is possible for a remote attacker to execute a callback
    function in the context of another domain (i.e. frame).

CAN-2005-2265

    Missing input sanitising of InstallVersion.compareTo() can cause
    the application to crash.

CAN-2005-2266

    Remote attackers could steal sensitive information such as cookies
    and passwords from web sites by accessing data in alien frames.

CAN-2005-2268

    It is possible for a Javascript dialog box to spoof a dialog box
    from a trusted site and facilitates phishing attacks.

CAN-2005-2269

    Remote attackers could modify certain tag properties of DOM nodes
    that could lead to the execution of arbitrary script or code.

CAN-2005-2270

    The Mozilla browser familie does not properly clone base objects,
    which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.8-1sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.10-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your Mozilla packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This security hole lets an attacker spoof any site that uses frames.
It is like [bug 13871](/show_bug.cgi?id=13871 "VERIFIED FIXED - Frame spoofing using loading two frames") and [bug 20682](/show_bug.cgi?id=20682 "VERIFIED FIXED - Frame spoofing #2") (in fact, it is a regression of the first).
I don't know if it regressed due to the fix for [bug 52920](/show_bug.cgi?id=52920 "VERIFIED FIXED - frame can't access sibling if parent frame is in another domain") or if it regressed
somewhere else.

In [bug 52920](/show_bug.cgi?id=52920 "VERIFIED FIXED - frame can't access sibling if parent frame is in another domain"), I advocated disallowing scripts from accessing the frames of a
frameset from another domain. We found that that policy broke a small number of
sites in which sibling frames needed to talk to each other.
There is a compromise policy: disallow access to frames of a frameset from
another domain in general but allow access to sibling frames (or even all frames
in the same content area as the script). This compromise policy would prevent
an attacker from spoofing a bank but would not break as many sites.
I still advocate the strict policy, because it's the only way to fix this hole
for the case of webmail sites that display external links in frames.

I tested with gmail, which supports https and uses frames.
I did get a "mixed secure and non-secure" warning, but only after I toggled a
hidden pref. Firefox normally only shows that dialog the first time you
encounter mixed content, and I guess I had encountered mixed content at some
point. The lock did change to a "broken" appearance, though.
Of course, if the attacker owns (in either sense) another https server, there is
no warning and the lock icon retains its "secure" appearance.

Mix content on http sites has been known about for \_years\_. Mix content on an
https site displays a dialog. I do not think that this is a major bug yet.
If the attacker owns an https site, the attacker must have a cert issued by a
trusted ca. How will the attack play out in this case?

> Mix content on http sites has been known about for \_years\_.
Can you elaborate? What has been known about for years? Who has known about it?
> Mix content on an https site displays a dialog.
As I said in [comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=246448#c11 "VERIFIED FIXED - can spoof framed sites by changing frame contents"), it often does not display a dialog.
> If the attacker owns an https site, the attacker must have a cert issued by a
> trusted ca. How will the attack play out in this case?
It's not hard to get such a cert. But if the attacker doesn't want his name
associated with his attack, he'll just break into a random https server on the
web and launch his attack from there.
Finally, it sounds like you would only consider this a major hole if I could
convince you that it affects https sites. I think it would be nearly as bad
even if it only affected http sites.

This patch fixes this bug, but I suspect that it's too restrictive and might
break some "valid" uses of frames/iframes out there. I'll see if I can come up
with something along Jesse's proposal above...

rest is cleanup and error code propoagation fixes that aren't needed to fix this

This should be safer, along the Jesse's lines, though not quite the same. I
think this should be ok, with this patch, Mozilla lets anything be loaded into
a frame, as long as the request for the load comes from the same top-level
window, if not, same-origin rules apply, the caller needs to be in the same
origin as the callee's parent (i.e. the frameset, or iframe host document).

Just to clarify on the mixed content warning, Firefox's behavior is slightly
different from Seamonkey's. It does not have the "show me this warning every
time" checkbox checked so the first time you dismiss it is the last time you'll
see it. SeaMonkey does have this show me again box checked so you'll get the
warning until you actually say "don't show me again". See bugs 206863 and [bug
172091](/show_bug.cgi?id=172091 "VERIFIED FIXED - Encryption security warnings: \"alert me whenever\" should stay checked").

The patch doesn't fix the first testcase if you click the buttons manually
(rather than with JS on a timer).
With the first testcase, nothing appears in the JS console indicating that
something was blocked. Something should appear in the JS console (regardless
of whether JS is used) like we do for other security measures.
Are the changes in nsHTMLFormElement.cpp part of the fix for this bug?

Yes, the nsHTMLFormElement.cpp changes make the error appear on the JS console
in the first testcase as well, though only when the form is submitted from JS.

Hmm, yeah, API differences. On the 1.7 branch, try changing the lines:
nsIPrincipal \*parentPrincipal;
if (!sop || !(parentPrincipal = sop->GetPrincipal())) {
to:
nsCOMPtr<nsIPrincipal> parentPrincipal;
if (!sop || NS\_FAILED(sop->GetPrincipal(getter\_AddRefs(parentPrincipal))) ||
!parentPrincipal) {
If that doesn't work, let me know and I'll whip up a patch that applies cleanly
and works on the 1.7 branch.

Hard to find real-world complicated frameset sites these days (like the one for
which the change in [bug 52920](/show_bug.cgi?id=52920 "VERIFIED FIXED - frame can't access sibling if parent frame is in another domain") was made). Good, in that if we regress those it
probably won't affect many popular sites. Bad because these sites live on inside
corporate intranets but we won't know about it until a regression drives these
people out of the woodwork.

I tested the new trunk patch. It works.
I see the JS console error with the first testcase now ("access to property
denied"). My problem was that I didn't run |make| in the layout directory.
Nothing happens when I click the buttons with target= manually in the first
testcase. I should get a JS console error or a new window (as if the frameset
page didn't exist at all). This problem isn't worth holding up releases and I
wouldn't mind filing a new bug for it.
Does the patch for the aviary branch also work on the 1.7 branch?

Looks like you went down the same path in nsDocument.cpp I tried for the
xpinstall whitelisting (so I didn't have to treat ftp links different than
http). I'm happy to see Chatzilla working after your change, somehow my version
managed to break it.
I think I explicitly added about: to the list of schemes where you test for js,
data, and chrome in order to get about:plugins working.
Earlier in that routine resource: is lumped with chrome: so I threw that in
too, but I didn't really look into whether that was necessary or safe since by
that time I had nearly given up on the approach.
continuing review and testing, but wanted to let you know the bad news :-(

basically we need to also exempt resource: uris and resource: uris embedded in
jar uris, so get the real url segment from inside the uri if it's a jar uri
(recursively if necessary) and check to see if that's one of the allowed sets
(which now includes resource this is secure since it points itno the app bin
dir)

Yeah, it was based on our discussions about your changes that I went down this
path, and only now did I realize that I don't need those changes at all. IOW,
the patch, w/o any changes to nsDocument.cpp is what we want, pending any other
problems.
The reason I don't need the nsDocument changes is that even though I pass in an
owner to the docshell loading code more often now, the docshell still only
passes the owner to the channel if the URI is a javascript: or data: URI, and
that's what matters for the code in nsDocument::Reset().
This twisted mess is badly in need of some cleanup, once the branches are taken
care of, I'll leave this bug open to clean this up, or I'll file a followup bug
on the cleanup.

Attached file
[frames testcases (.zip)](attachment.cgi?id=150797)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=150797&action=edit)

To use this testcase as is you need to run a web server on localhost, and add
the following aliases in your hosts file: search.localhost, content.localhost
and www.localhost
There are two testcases with the same basic structure, a top "menu bar" frame,
a left navigation frame, and a content frame. The navigation and content frames
themselves each contain two frames. <http://localhost/framespoof/topframe.html>
loads the top frame from localhost, and the left and right frames from
content.localhost. <http://localhost/framespoof/topmulti.html> is mostly the
same except the left navigation frame is loaded from search.localhost
All links work prior to this patch. They also work in IE which can be spoofed
by both of Jesse's demos.
After the patch with topframe.html:
- left and right frames can target each other
- top frame can target the left and right outer frames but not
any of the subframes
with topmulti.html
- same restrictions on the top frame
- left and right frames cannot target each other
As an added bonus load either testcase using www.localhost as the host and now
the top frame can't even target the outer left or right frames.
This frame arrangement doesn't seem overly complicated or unreasonable, I'm
sure I've used sites that worked much like these examples. We're going to get a
lot of squawking on this (mostly corporate and university intranet users I
suspect).

I searched bugzilla for comments containing docshell.frameloadcheck.disabled. I
found three bugs:
[bug 248138](/show_bug.cgi?id=248138 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Links with <target> don't work properly") (sbroker.de), which uses a pop-up "transaction area"
[bug 246844](/show_bug.cgi?id=246844 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - PHPMyAdmin: left frame menu for accesing tables doesn't work, neither the DB select menu") (PHPMyAdmin), sounds like it's all in one window
[bug 247016](/show_bug.cgi?id=247016 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - hyperlinks in frames not functioning") (some framed site), sounds like it's all in one window
Only sbroker.de uses separate windows. The others should be fixed once jst
figures out how to make targeted link loads follow the same policy as script
loads. Is there a bug filed for that?

Are these new bugs? Or normal?
Or result of incomplete fix for this bug on release build of Firefox 0.9/Firefox

What is expected result of [Bug 249751](/show_bug.cgi?id=249751 "NEW - Links whose onclick closes the window fail to trigger link")?

Jst, care to have a look at this? The patch should be good -- it even works
against the supplied testcases -- but I'd like you to sign off on it anyway
since there were some changes due to conflict resolution, different APIs, etc.

sr=jst, but this caused regression [bug 246923](/show_bug.cgi?id=246923 "RESOLVED FIXED - links in nested frame fail, give a false NS_ERROR_DOM_PROP_ACCESS_DENIED"), which backs out part of this

Having some difficulty with this fix when some frames are in the same domain,
but are using multiple servers in the same domain for different frames.
Example: A frameset with the parent comming from www1.domain.com, left subframe
comming from www1.domain.com, and right subframe comming from www2.domain.com.
Using a target <a href="www1.domain.com" target="right"> located in the left
frame is not being allowed to re-populate the right frame under this fix. If
the original right frame was loaded with a page from www1.domain.com, then it
works until the right frame is loaded with www2.domain.com, then it does not.

Does setting document domain to same one("domain.com") work?
(Issue document.domain="domain.com"; at both sites)
This is normal way to avoid denial of "Cross Site Scripting" by "Same Origin
Policy" when multiple servers in a domain are used.

Collin, Adam, do your tests for [bug 408052](/show_bug.cgi?id=408052 "VERIFIED FIXED - Adopt \"descendant\" frame navigation policy to prevent frame hijacking") cover all the issues in this bug? Or does this still need more testcases?

This is covered by test\_bug13871.html, which tests for the same things as demo 1 and demo 2 (as well as two other methods of navigating the frame).

Oh, I forgot this was the bug with the big zip file test case. I think we cover all the cases there, but the tests are spread out among a bunch of tests and we don't have a test case with such a complex frame hierarchy. One possibility is to copy the zip file as a giant test case, but it's probably more useful to keep the more focused tests we have now.

1. Topic:

Updated mozilla, galeon and epiphany packages that fix multiple
vulnerabilities are now available.

Mozilla is an open-source Web browser, designed for standards
compliance, performance, and portability.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

Note that some of these issues have already been fixed in Redhat 9 and
Fedora Core 1. Please refer to previous advisories for details.

NISCC testing of implementations of the S/MIME protocol uncovered a number
of bugs in NSS versions prior to 3.9. The parsing of unexpected ASN.1
constructs within S/MIME data could cause Mozilla to crash or consume large
amounts of memory. A remote attacker could potentially trigger these bugs
by sending a carefully-crafted S/MIME message to a victim. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0564 to this issue.

Andreas Sandblad discovered a cross-site scripting issue that affects
various versions of Mozilla. When linking to a new page it is still
possible to interact with the old page before the new page has been
successfully loaded. Any Javascript events will be invoked in the context
of the new page, making cross-site scripting possible if the different
pages belong to different domains. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0191 to
this issue.

Flaws have been found in the cookie path handling between a number of Web
browsers and servers. The HTTP cookie standard allows a Web server
supplying a cookie to a client to specify a subset of URLs on the origin
server to which the cookie applies. Web servers such as Apache do not
filter returned cookies and assume that the client will only send back
cookies for requests that fall within the server-supplied subset of URLs.
However, by supplying URLs that use path traversal (/../) and character
encoding, it is possible to fool many browsers into sending a cookie to a
path outside of the originally-specified subset. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0594 to this issue.

Zen Parse reported improper input validation to the SOAPParameter object
constructor leading to an integer overflow and controllable heap
corruption. Malicious JavaScript could be written to utilize this flaw and
could allow arbitrary code execution. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0722 to
this issue.

During a source code audit, Chris Evans discovered a buffer overflow and
integer overflows which affect the libpng code inside Mozilla. An attacker
could create a carefully crafted PNG file in such a way that it would cause
Mozilla to crash or execute arbitrary code when the image was viewed.
(CAN-2004-0597, CAN-2004-0599)

Zen Parse reported a flaw in the POP3 capability. A malicious POP3 server
could send a carefully crafted response that would cause a heap overflow
and potentially allow execution of arbitrary code as the user running
Mozilla. (CAN-2004-0757)

Marcel Boesch found a flaw that allows a CA certificate to be imported with
a DN the same as that of the built-in CA root certificates, which can cause
a denial of service to SSL pages, as the malicious certificate is treated
as invalid. (CAN-2004-0758)

Met - Martin Hassman reported a flaw in Mozilla that could allow malicious
Javascript code to upload local files from a users machine without
requiring confirmation. (CAN-2004-0759)

Mindlock Security reported a flaw in ftp URI handling. By using a NULL
character (%00) in a ftp URI, Mozilla can be confused into opening a
resource as a different MIME type. (CAN-2004-0760)

Mozilla does not properly prevent a frame in one domain from injecting
content into a frame that belongs to another domain, which facilitates
website spoofing and other attacks, also known as the frame injection
vulnerability. (CAN-2004-0718)

Tolga Tarhan reported a flaw that can allow a malicious webpage to use a
redirect sequence to spoof the security lock icon that makes a webpage
appear to be encrypted. (CAN-2004-0761)

Jesse Ruderman reported a security issue that affects a number of browsers
including Mozilla that could allow malicious websites to install arbitrary
extensions by using interactive events to manipulate the XPInstall Security
dialog box. (CAN-2004-0762)

Emmanouel Kellinis discovered a caching flaw in Mozilla which allows
malicious websites to spoof certificates of trusted websites via
redirects and Javascript that uses the "onunload" method. (CAN-2004-0763)

Mozilla allowed malicious websites to hijack the user interface via the
"chrome" flag and XML User Interface Language (XUL) files. (CAN-2004-0764)

The cert_TestHostName function in Mozilla only checks the hostname portion
of a certificate when the hostname portion of the URI is not a fully
qualified domain name (FQDN). This flaw could be used for spoofing if an
attacker had control of machines on a default DNS search path. (CAN-2004-0765)

Jesse Ruderman discovered a cross-domain scripting bug in Mozilla. If
a user is tricked into dragging a javascript link into another frame or
page, it becomes possible for an attacker to steal or modify sensitive
information from that site. Additionally, if a user is tricked into
dragging two links in sequence to another window (not frame), it is
possible for the attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0905 to this issue.

Gael Delalleau discovered an integer overflow which affects the BMP
handling code inside Mozilla. An attacker could create a carefully crafted
BMP file in such a way that it would cause Mozilla to crash or execute
arbitrary code when the image is viewed. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0904 to
this issue.

Georgi Guninski discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the vCard
display routines. An attacker could create a carefully crafted vCard file
in such a way that it would cause Mozilla to crash or execute arbitrary
code when viewed. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0903 to this issue.

Wladimir Palant discovered a flaw in the way javascript interacts with
the clipboard. It is possible that an attacker could use malicious
javascript code to steal sensitive data which has been copied into the
clipboard. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0908 to this issue.

Georgi Guninski discovered a heap based buffer overflow in the "Send
Page" feature. It is possible that an attacker could construct a link in
such a way that a user attempting to forward it could result in a crash or
arbitrary code execution. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0902 to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit
<http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs/> for directions on how to configure yum
and apt-get.
