- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to the way Virtual PC for Mac creates a temporary file during execution. The method used to handle this file does not correctly validate its contents.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper handling and validation of a temporary file, allowing for the insertion of malicious code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary code with system privileges, potentially gaining complete control over the affected system. This includes the ability to add, delete, or modify data, as well as create or delete user accounts with root access.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to insert malicious code into the temporary file created by Virtual PC for Mac.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have a valid logon account on the local system or access to a valid logon account to exploit the vulnerability. They also need to be able to start Virtual PC for Mac.
