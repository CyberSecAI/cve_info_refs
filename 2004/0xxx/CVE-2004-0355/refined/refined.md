- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `usercp_functions.php` file where the `getimagesize()` function is used on a user-supplied file path without proper validation. When an invalid file path is provided, the `getimagesize()` function throws a PHP warning including the full path of the file, which is then displayed to the user.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path disclosure vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user input when processing file paths, leading to an information leak. Specifically, the application reveals the full server path to the `usercp_functions.php` file when it fails to read an image file using the `getimagesize()` function.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can learn the full installation path of the Invision Power Board and the web server's document root (htdocs). This information can aid in further attacks.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the "Personal Photo" upload feature in the "My Controls" section. An attacker can provide an arbitrary (non-image) filename when prompted to upload an image to trigger the PHP error message.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the forum with access to the "My Controls" section and the ability to attempt to change their personal photo. No other specific capabilities are needed.
