    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The HTTP authentication cache in Mozilla products did not differentiate between HTTP and HTTPS connections for the same host and port. It was using realm, hostname and port as keys to store password. This allows a non-secure connection to potentially reuse credentials of a secure connection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The authentication cache reuses credentials based on hostname, port, and realm but does not consider the connection protocol (HTTP vs HTTPS).",
        "The Java plugin for Mozilla doesn't distinguish between proxy and origin server authentication, potentially sending credentials for the wrong server."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can potentially steal HTTP basic authentication credentials by spoofing a non-SSL version of a previously accessed secure site or by compromising a proxy or DNS server.  If the user previously authenticated with a secure site, the attacker could trigger the browser to send saved credentials to a non-SSL site without further prompts or user interaction.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "DNS spoofing, where an attacker redirects traffic intended for a secure site to a non-secure site.",
        "Compromised proxy server, where the proxy server can inject links to non-secure resources on a previously authenticated site to harvest credentials.",
        "Compromised DNS servers, allowing attackers to redirect traffic.",
         "Man-in-the-middle attacks"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the network path between the user and the target server, or compromise a proxy server or DNS server. They also need to be able to trick the user into visiting a specific URL."
