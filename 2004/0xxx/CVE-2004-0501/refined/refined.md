The provided content describes a vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook 2003 that allows an attacker to confirm if a recipient has viewed an email. This is achieved by exploiting the way Outlook handles Vector Markup Language (VML) frames.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in Outlook 2003's handling of VML frames within HTML emails. Despite attempts to restrict remote content loading, Outlook processes the `src` attribute of VML frames, fetching content from the specified URL. This bypasses the intended security measures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypass of Restricted Zone:** Outlook 2003 renders HTML emails in a "restricted zone" by default, which should block potentially harmful elements like iframes, objects, and scripts. However, the VML frame element and its `src` attribute are not properly restricted.
- **Remote Content Loading:** The VML frame's `src` attribute allows loading remote content, enabling the attacker to ping their server when a recipient views the email.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Email Read Confirmation:** An attacker can determine if a recipient has opened and viewed their email without requiring images or scripts.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the immediate impact is read confirmation, the vulnerability could potentially be leveraged to load malicious content or perform further exploitation, although not explicitly detailed in the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** The vulnerability is exploited through specially crafted HTML emails containing VML frames with a `src` attribute pointing to the attacker's server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send emails to the targeted recipients.
- The attacker needs to host a server or endpoint to receive the ping when the victim opens the email.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is described as being quickly and silently patched by Microsoft.
- The vulnerability was identified by the submitter after purchasing the software.
- The submitter noted that this was "quick 72 hour prodding" and revealed many holes in Outlook 2003.
- The provided content references BID 10323 and BID 10307, which are related to the same issue.
- There is some discussion of the observed behavior being specific to internal Exchange environments, which is not fully explained.
