OVERVIEW
========
"Help and Support Center (HSC) is a feature in Windows that provides
help on a variety of topics" It can also be accessed via HCP: URLs.
HSC is installed by default on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems.

An input invalidation vulnerability in HSC allows exposes users to
a remote code execution vulnerability that allows an attacker to run
arbitrary code when the victim opens a specially formatted HCP: URL.
The user may be automatically directed to such URL when a web page is
viewed. The issue can also be exploited via e-mail.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS
=================
Microsoft Windows Operating Systems with Help and Support Center

Microsoft Windows XP and Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1
Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1
Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003
Microsoft Windows ServerT 2003
Microsoft Windows Server 2003

items: "%windir%\PCHealth\HelpCtr\Binaries\HelpCtr.exe
        %windir%\PCHEALTH\HELPCTR\System\DVDUpgrd.htm
        %windir%\PCHEALTH\HELPCTR\System\DVDUpgrd.js

DETAILS
=======
The HSC installation contains various HTML and javascript files,which
are intended to be used by HSC's internal use. The HTML files belong
in the My Computer Zone because they require e.g. the ability to
launch external helper programs with JavaScript.

By using a specialy crafted url an attacker can cause the users local
machine to start and render helpctr.exe in the local context and passes
the injected url to the application. The user is then presented with the
Help and Support DvD Upgrade dialog in Help and Support Center.

With the Dvdupgrade page, The injected url is now linked to the "upgrade
now" button. By pressing the updrade now button, the user is presented
with a (open) / (save) dialog box with the offending ( attackers ) file.

This allows an attacker to initiate the Dvdupgrade action on HSC,
inject JavaScript code which will be run in the context of these HTML
files, speciffically "HCP://system/DVDUpgrd/dvdupgrd.htm". In this
way the attacker can run scripts in the My Computer Zone, which can
e.g. download an start an attacker-supplied EXE program.

As an aside, no url activity is displayed and there is no address or status
bar for Help and Support.

SOLUTION
========
Microsoft was contacted on March 18th, 2004. A patch has been
produced to correct the vulnerability. They have issued the
following:

Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-015

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves a newly-discovered vulnerability. A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Help and Support Center because of the way that it handles HCP URL validation. The vulnerability is documented in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin.

If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

Microsoft recommends that customers install the update at the earliest opportunity.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Does this update contain any other changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin, this update includes the following changes in functionality:

* Windows XP supports a feature that allows it to automatically offer a user an option to upgrade a DVD decoder. This feature has been removed to provide greater security and to prevent potential malicious use. Microsoft considers this to be a defense in depth measure that we are taking to provide additional protection against malicious use. Users who try to use this feature after they install the update will receive an error message that indicates that the system "Cannot display this page." Microsoft currently has plans to provide an improved version of this feature in a future service pack.
* Microsoft has also made another defense in depth change that will have an affect on the Found New Hardware Wizard. The Help and Support Center has a feature that sometimes prompts users to send hardware profile information after they run the Found New Hardware Wizard. This feature has been removed. After users install the update, when the Found New Hardware Wizard finishes in these cases, they will receive an error message that indicates that the system "Cannot display this page."

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA will determine if this update is required. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**Note** After April 20, 2004, the Mssecure.xml file that is used by MBSA 1.1.1 and earlier versions is no longer being updated with new security bulletin data. Therefore, scans that are performed with MBSA 1.1.1 or earlier after that date will be incomplete. All users should upgrade to MBSA 1.2 because it provides more accurate security update detection and supports additional products. Users can download MBSA 1.2 from the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about MBSA support, visit the following [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) 1.2 Q&A; Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsaqa.mspx).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

## Vulnerability Details

#### Help and Support Center Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0199:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Help and Support Center because of the way that it handles HCP URL validation. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious HCP URL that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site or viewed a malicious e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, significant user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for Help and Support Center Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0199:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
* By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

  The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

  + Apply the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-040](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-040) or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
  + Use Internet Explorer 6 or later.
  + Use the Microsoft Outlook E-mail Security Update, use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or later, or use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or later in its default configuration.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
* Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 are not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Help and Support Center Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0199:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Unregister the HCP Protocol.**

  To help prevent an attack, unregister the HCP Protocol by deleting the following key from the registry: HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\HCP. To do so, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.
  2. Type **regedit**, and then click **OK**.
     The registry editor program launches.
  3. Expand **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT**, and then highlight the **HCP** key.
  4. Right-click the **HCP** key, and then click **Delete**.

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Unregistering the HCP protocol will break all local, legitimate help links that use hcp://. For example, links in Control Panel may no longer work.
* **Install** **Outlook E-mail Security Update** **if you are using Outlook 2000 SP1 or earlier.**

  By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002 and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been installed.

  Customers who use any of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.
* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or later, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or later, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or later and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about enabling this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [307594](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [291387](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ for Help and Support Center Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0199:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges. However, significant user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The process that the Help and Support Center uses to validate data input.

**What** **is** **the** **Help** **and** **Support** **Center?**

The Help and Support Center (HSC) is a feature in Windows that provides help on a variety of topics. For example, HSC can teach users about Windows features, how to download and install software updates, how to determine whether a particular hardware device is compatible with Windows, and how to receive help from Microsoft. Users and programs can use URL links to the Help and Support Center by using the "hcp://" prefix in a URL link instead of "https://."

**What is the HCP protocol?**

Similar to the way that the HTTP protocol can use execute URL links to open a Web browser, the HCP protocol can execute URL links to open the Help and Support Center feature.

**What** **is** **wrong** **with** **the** **Help** **and** **Support** **Center?**

An error in input validation occurs.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to host a malicious Web site and then persuade a user to view that Web site. An attacker could also create an HTML e-mail message that has a specially crafted link, and then persuade a user to view the HTML e-mail message and then click the malicious link If the user clicked this link, a window could open with an HCP URL of the attacker's choice. However, at this point significant additional user interaction is required. After clicking the link, the user would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after a user performed these actions.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 contain the affected version of the Help and Support Center. Other platforms are not affected because they do not contain the Help and Support Center or because the nature of the vulnerability is different on those platforms.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003. Does Windows Server 2003 mitigate this vulnerability?**

No. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration. However, the HCP protocol is permitted to access the Help and Support Center by default. Therefore, Windows Server 2003 is vulnerable.

For more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration, visit the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=d41b036c-e2e1-4960-99bb-9757f7e9e31b&displaylang;=en).

**What does the update do?**

This update removes the vulnerability by modifying the validation of data that is passed to the Help and Support Center.

**How does this vulnerability relate to the Help and SupportCenter vulnerability that is corrected by MS04-011?**

Both vulnerabilities were in the Help and Support Center. However, this update corrects a new vulnerability that was not addressed as part of MS04-011. MS04-011 fully protects against the vulnerability that is discussed in that bulletin, but does not address this new vulnerability. This update does not replace MS04-011. You must install this update and the update provided as part of the MS04-011 security bulletin to be protected from both vulnerabilities.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Note** When you install this security update on Windows Server 2003 or on Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003, the installer checks to see if any of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [824994](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=824994).

**Verifying Update Installation**

To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool, which allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP1\KB840374\Filelist

**Note** This registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 840374 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows XP (all versions)

**Note** For Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003, this security update is the same as the Windows Server 2003 64-Bit Edition security update.

**Prerequisites**
This security update requires the release version of Windows XP or Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1). For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [322389](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;322389).

**Inclusion in Future Service Packs:**
The update for these issues will be included in Windows XP Service Pack 2.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches:

**/help**               Displays the command line options

**Setup Modes**

**/quiet**            Quiet mode (no user interaction or display)

**/passive**            Unattended mode (progress bar only)

**/uninstall**          Uninstalls the package

**Restart Options**

**/norestart**          Do not restart when installation is complete

**/forcerestart**      Restart after installation

**Special Options**

**/l**           Lists installed Windows hotfixes or update packages

**/o**          Overwrite OEM files without prompting

**/n**          Do not backup files needed for uninstall

**/f**           Force other programs to close when the computer shuts down

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the previous version of the setup utility uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [262841](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;262841).

**Deployment Information**

To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows XP:

**Windowsxp-kb840374-x86-enu /passive /quiet**

To install the security update without forcing the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows XP:

**Windowsxp-kb840374-x86-enu /norestart**

For information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21125).

**Restart Requirement**

In some cases, this update does not require a restart. The installer stops the required services, applies the update, and then restarts the services. However, if the required services cannot be stopped for any reason or if required files are in use, this update will require a restart. If this occurs, a message appears that advises you to restart.

**Removal Information**

To remove this update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

System administrators can also use the Spuninst.exe utility to remove this security update. The Spuninst.exe is located in the %Windir%\$NTUninstallKB840374$\Spuninst folder. The Spuninst.exe utility supports the following setup switches:

**/?** : Show the list of installation switches.

**/u**: Use unattended mode.

**/f**: Force other programs to quit when the computer shuts down.

**/z**: Do not restart when the installation is complete.

**/q**: Use Quiet mode (no user interaction).

**File Information**

The English version of this update has the file attributes (or later) that are listed in the following table. The dates and times for these files are listed in coordinated universal time (UTC). When you view the file information, it is converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use the **Time Zone** tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.

**Notes** The Windows XP and Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 versions of this security update are packaged as dual-mode packages, which contain files for both the original version of Windows XP and Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1). For more information about dual-mode packages, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [328848](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=328848).

When you install the Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 security update, the installer checks to see if any of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [824994](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=824994).

**Verifying Update Installation**

To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool, which allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys:

For Windows XP Home Edition, Windows XP Professional, Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1, Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, and Windows XP Media Center Edition:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP2\KB840374\Filelist

For Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP1\KB840374\Filelist

**Note** This registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 840374 security update into the Windows installation source files.

- Windows Help Center - Dvdupgrade -
OVERVIEW
========
"Help and Support Center (HSC) is a feature in Windows that provides
help on a variety of topics" It can also be accessed via HCP: URLs.
HSC is installed by default on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems.
An input invalidation vulnerability in HSC allows exposes users to
a remote code execution vulnerability that allows an attacker to run
arbitrary code when the victim opens a specially formatted HCP: URL.
The user may be automatically directed to such URL when a web page is
viewed. The issue can also be exploited via e-mail.
AFFECTED PRODUCTS
=================
Microsoft Windows Operating Systems with Help and Support Center
Microsoft Windows XP and Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1
Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1
Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003
Microsoft Windows Server 2003
Microsoft Windows Server 2003
items: "%windir%\PCHealth\HelpCtr\Binaries\HelpCtr.exe
%windir%\PCHEALTH\HELPCTR\System\DVDUpgrd.htm
%windir%\PCHEALTH\HELPCTR\System\DVDUpgrd.js
DETAILS
=======
The HSC installation contains various HTML and javascript files,which
are intended to be used by HSC's internal use. The HTML files belong
in the My Computer Zone because they require e.g. the ability to
launch external helper programs with JavaScript.
By using a specialy crafted url an attacker can cause the users local
machine to start and render helpctr.exe in the local context and passes
the injected url to the application. The user is then presented with the
Help and Support DvD Upgrade dialog in Help and Support Center.
With the Dvdupgrade page, The injected url is now linked to the "upgrade
now" button. By pressing the updrade now button, the user is presented
with a (open) / (save) dialog box with the offending ( attackers ) file.
This allows an attacker to initiate the Dvdupgrade action on HSC,
inject JavaScript code which will be run in the context of these HTML
files, speciffically "HCP://system/DVDUpgrd/dvdupgrd.htm". In this
way the attacker can run scripts in the My Computer Zone, which can
e.g. download an start an attacker-supplied EXE program.
As an aside, no url activity is displayed and there is no address or status
bar for Help and Support.
SOLUTION
========
Microsoft was contacted on March 18th, 2004. A patch has been
produced to correct the vulnerability. They have issued the
following:
Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-015
Vulnerability in Help and Support Center Could Allow Remote Code Execution (840374)
