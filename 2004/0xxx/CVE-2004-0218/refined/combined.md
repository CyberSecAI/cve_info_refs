How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## isakmpd fails to handle ISAKMP packets with "Payload Length" of zero

#### Vulnerability Note VU#349113

Original Release Date: 2004-08-27 | Last Revised: 2004-08-27

---

### Overview

A vulnerability exists in the isakmpd that could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.

### Description

| The OpenBSD [isakmpd](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=isakmpd&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=OpenBSD+Current&arch=i386&format=html) establishes security associations for encrypted and authenticated (IPsec) network traffic. It implements the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol [(ISAKMP)](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2408.txt) and Internet Key Exchange [(IKE)](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2409.txt) protocol. The ISAKMP standard specifies a "Payload Length" field within the "Generic Payload Header". This field is populated by the sender and specifies the length in octets of the current payload, including the generic payload header. A flaw in the handling of packets with a specified length of zero could cause isakmpd to enter an infinite loop, preempting normal operations.  This issue is reportedly similar to [VU#738518](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/738518). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could cause the isakmpd service to become unresponsive. Subsequent IPsec-enabled communications may be disrupted as a result. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from the vendor**Patches have been released to address this issue. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more details. |

### [OpenBSD](#CRDY-642S5P) Affected

Updated:  August 20, 2004

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Several bugs have been found in the ISAKMP daemon which can lead to memory
leaks and a remote denial of service condition. An attacker can craft
malformed payloads that can cause the isakmpd(8) process to stop
processing requests.

The problem is fixed in -current, 3.4-stable and 3.3-stable.

Patches are available at:

  ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.4/common/015\_isakmpd2.patch
  ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.3/common/020\_isakmpd2.patch
