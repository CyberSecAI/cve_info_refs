The provided content details multiple denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities in WFTPD Pro Server 3.21 and potentially other versions.

**Vulnerability 1: Memory Exhaustion**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient buffer management when processing FTP commands. The server dynamically increases the buffer size by 512 bytes when it receives data without a newline character (0Ah), leading to excessive memory allocation.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation and a limit on the dynamically allocated buffer.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can exhaust server memory by sending data without newline characters. This can lead to a crash or service interruption.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending arbitrary bytes other than 0Ah to the FTP server. Multiple clients can accelerate the exhaustion. Sending 00h as the first byte can speed up the process.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Network access to the vulnerable FTP service. No authentication is required.

**Vulnerability 2: CPU Exhaustion**

*   **Root Cause:** Inefficient string scanning in the buffer management function. The server repeatedly scans the entire buffer for a newline character when it receives new data without one.
*   **Weakness:** Inefficient algorithm for newline detection within the dynamically allocated buffer.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can cause the server to use 100% CPU by sending a large buffer followed by small packets without 0Ah or 00h bytes, resulting in a DoS.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Sending a large buffer with no 0Ah or 00h bytes, then sending small packets without them. Using bytes >= 80h makes the process twice as slow.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Network access to the vulnerable FTP service. No authentication is required.

**Vulnerability 3: Stack Overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists when processing MKD or XMKD commands with specific parameters when the "XeroxDocutech" option is enabled for a user.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of bounds checking when concatenating path strings.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker, after logging in, can crash the WFTPD server by overflowing a string on the stack.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a MKD or XMKD command with an argument that, when combined with the current path and ".djo", creates a 261 byte long string.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a valid user account with the "XeroxDocutech" option set to 1.
