```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The FirstClass Desktop Client 7.1 improperly handles hyperlinks in RTF formatted messages, allowing local file execution.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
The application does not properly validate or sanitize URLs within RTF messages. This allows an attacker to embed a local file path within a hyperlink, which when clicked, results in the execution of the specified file.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can execute arbitrary local files on the victim's machine. The example given is the execution of `logoff.exe`, which would forcefully terminate all running processes and log the user out. This can cause denial of service.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector is via a specially crafted RTF formatted email message containing a malicious hyperlink.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send an email to a user of the FirstClass Desktop Client 7.1. The attacker does not need local access to the victim's machine.
