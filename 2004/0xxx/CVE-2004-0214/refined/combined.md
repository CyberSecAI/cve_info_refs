## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves several newly-discovered, public vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own Vulnerability Details section.

If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges. However, user interaction is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Windows 98, 98 SE, ME | Windows NT 4.0 | Windows 2000 | Windows XP and Windows XP Service Pack 1 | Windows Server 2003 |

| **Aggregate Severity of All Vulnerabilities** | **Not Critical** | **Critical** | **Critical** | **Critical** | **Important** |  |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers can install only this update.

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces several prior security bulletins. The security bulletin IDs and operating systems that are affected are listed in the following table.

| Bulletin ID | Windows NT 4.0 | Windows 2000 | Windows XP | Windows Server 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [**MS02-014**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33411) | Replaced | Replaced | Not Applicable | Not Applicable |
| [**MS03-027**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=17908) | Not Applicable | Not Applicable | Replaced | Not Applicable |

**Does this update contain any other security-related changes?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin, this update includes the following changes:

* On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, we have made a defense in depth change that limits the functionality of the Shell. This change in functionality prevents the use of the âshell:â protocol so that it does not automatically start applications that have known filename extension mappings when it processes certain types of malformed requests. This change is consistent with the default settings in Windows XP Service Pack 2.
* On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 we have made another defense in depth change that prevents the Shell from using the âshell:â protocol to reference files. This protocol was designed to reference system objects and folders, not to reference files. This change is consistent with the default settings in Windows XP Service Pack 2.

**I am still using Windows XP, but extended security update support ended on September 30th, 2004. However, this bulletin has a security update for this operating system version. Why is that?**

The original version of Windows XP, commonly known as Windows XP Gold or Windows XP Release to Manufacturing (RTM) version, reached the end of its extended security update support life cycle on September 30, 2004. However, the end-of-life occurred very recently. In this case, the majority of the steps that are required to address this vulnerability were completed before this date. Therefore, we have decided to release a security update for this operating system version as part of this security bulletin.

We do not anticipate doing this for future vulnerabilities that may affect this operating system version, but we reserve the right to produce updates and to make these updates available when necessary. It should be a priority for customers who have this operating system version to migrate to supported operating system versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Service Pack Product Life Cycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?pr=lifesupsps).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. SMS can search for the existence of the affected files that are documented in the Security Update Information section of this bulletin. Update all versions of affected files that are earlier than versions that are documented in this security bulletin. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

## Vulnerability Details

#### Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0214:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows Shell starts applications. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability if a user visited a malicious Web site. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0214:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. An attack could only occur after they performed this action.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
* By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

  The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

  + Apply the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-040](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=19873) or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
  + Use Internet Explorer 6 or later.
  + Use the Microsoft Outlook E-mail Security Update, use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or later, or use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or later in its default configuration.

#### Workarounds for Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0214:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Install the** [**Outlook E-mail Security Update**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) **if you are using Outlook 2000 SP1 or earlier to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002 and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

  Customers who use any of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.
* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or later, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or later, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or later and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about enabling this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [307594](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [291387](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ for Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0214:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Unchecked buffers in Windows Shell functions.

**What is the Windows Shell?**

The Microsoft Windows user interface (UI) provides users with access to a wide variety of objects that are necessary for running applications and managing the operating system. The most numerous and familiar of these objects are the folders and files that reside on computer disk drives. There are also a number of virtual objects that allow the user to do tasks such as sending files to remote printers or accessing the Recycle Bin. The Shell organizes these objects into a hierarchical namespace and provides users and applications with a consistent and efficient way to access and manage objects. For more information, visit the following [Web site](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/nhp/default.asp?contentid=28000443).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to host a malicious Web site and then persuade a user to view that Web site. An attacker could also create an e-mail message that has a specially crafted link, and then persuade a user to view the e-mail message and then click the malicious link.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers are only at risk if users are given the ability to log on and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?**

No. Although Windows Millennium Edition does contain the affected component, the vulnerability is not critical. For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could attempt to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Windows Shell validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CAN-2004-0214.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had seen examples of proof of concept code published publicly but had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Program Group Converter Vulnerability- CAN-2004-0572:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Program Group Converter because of the way that it handles specially crafted requests. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious request that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user performed an action such as opening a file attachment or clicking a HTML link. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for Program Group Converter Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0572:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. An attack could only occur after they performed this action.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
* By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) has been installed.

#### FAQ for Program Group Converter - CAN-2004-0572:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the Program Group Converter application.

**What is Program Group Converter?**

The Program Group Converter was used to convert Program Manager Group files that were created in Windows 3.1, Windows 3.11, Windows for Workgroups 3.1, and Windows for Workgroups 3.11 so that they could be used by later operating systems. This application is also used during Windows Setup and by third-party applications during the installation of applications or devices. For more information about Program Group Converter, visit the following [Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;119941).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could host a malicious Web site and then persuade a user to visit that Web site. An attacker could also create an HTML e-mail message that contains a specially crafted link, and then persuade a user to view the HTML e-mail message and click the link. An attacker could also send a specially crafted .grp file to a user, and then persuade the user to open the file.

An attacker could also access the affected component through another vector. For example, an attacker could use another program that passes parameters to the vulnerable component (locally or remotely).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers are only at risk if users are given the ability to log on and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?**

No. Although Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition do contain the affected component, the vulnerability is not critical. For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could attempt to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Program Group Converter application validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CAN-2004-0572.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had seen examples of proof of concept code published publicly but had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Verifying Update Installation**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. This tool allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB841356\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 841356 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows NT 4.0 (all versions)

**Prerequisites**

This security update requires Windows NT Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a (SP6a), or Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6 (SP6).

The software that is listed has been tested to determine if the versions are affected. Other versions either no longer include security update support or may not be affected.

**/Q:U** Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user.

**/Q:A** Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user.

**/T**: **<full path>** Specifies the target folder for extracting files.

**/C** Extracts the files without installing them. If **/T**: path is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder.

**/C**: **<Cmd>** Override Install Command defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the setup .inf or .exe file.

**/R:N** Never restarts the computer after installation.

**/R:I** Prompts the user to restart the computer if a restart is required, except when used with /**Q:A**.

**/R:A** Always restarts the computer after installation.

**/R:S** Restarts the computer after installation without prompting the user.

**/N:V** No version checking - Install the program over any previous version.

**Note** These switches do not necessarily work with all updates. If a switch is not available that functionality is necessary for the correct installation of the update. Also, using the **/N:V** switch is unsupported and may result in an unbootable system. If the installation is unsuccessful, you should consult your support professional to understand why it failed to install.

## Microsoft Windows Shell contains a buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#616200

Original Release Date: 2004-11-23 | Last Revised: 2004-11-23

---

### Overview

A remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Windows Shell.

### Description

| The Microsoft Windows Shell provides the basic human-computer interface for Windows systems. Microsoft describes the Shell as follows:  *The Windows Shell is responsible for providing the basic framework of the Windows user interface experience. It is most familiar to users as the Windows Desktop, but also provides a variety of other functions to help define the user's computing session, including organizing files and folders, and providing the means to start applications.*  A buffer overflow exists in the process the Windows Shell uses to launch applications. If an attacker can persuade a user to visit a specially crafted web page the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. For more detailed information and for a list of vulnerable software, see Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-037](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-037.mspx).  Please also note that this advisory replaces [MS04-024](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-024.mspx) for Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, 2000, XP, and Server 2003. |
| --- |

### Impact

| If a remote attacker can persuade a user to visit a specially crafted web page, the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on that user's system, possibly with elevated privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**  Apply a patch as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin  [MS04-037](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-037.mspx). Please also note that Microsoft is actively deploying the patches for this vulnerability via [Windows Update](http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/). |
