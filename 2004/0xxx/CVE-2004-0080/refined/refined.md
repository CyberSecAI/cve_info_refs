Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-0080:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `login` program within the `util-linux` package used a pointer after it had been freed and reallocated. This incorrect memory management could lead to sensitive data being leaked.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use-after-free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability where a memory location is accessed after being released. When the same memory is reallocated, the subsequent access can lead to information disclosure of previously stored data.
- **Information Leakage:** This use-after-free leads to the potential exposure of sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in memory that the `login` process is using, this data could be, passwords, usernames or parts of the system configuration.
- The vulnerability is rated as "low" severity by Gentoo but has an "exploitable remote" vector.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access (Indirect):** Although not directly mentioned as a requirement, the vulnerability exists within the `login` program which is typically used locally during system login processes. 
- **Remote access**: The Gentoo Security Advisory mentions "remote" exploitability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would need to trigger the vulnerable code path in the `login` program.
- A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability if the system does not have PAM support enabled.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects `util-linux` versions 2.11 and earlier.
- Systems with PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) enabled are *not* vulnerable, as they use a different `login` binary provided by `pam-login`.
- Several vendors such as Netwosix, SCO OpenLinux, Red Hat and Gentoo have released patches or advisories for this vulnerability
