Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2004-0104:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the presence of format string vulnerabilities in the `metamail` package, specifically within the `SaveSquirrelFile()` and `PrintHeader()` functions of `metamail.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Format String Bug in `SaveSquirrelFile()`:** This occurs when a message has a "multipart/alternative" media type, and a body part's "Content-Type" header includes parameter names or values with format string specifiers. Two `fprintf()` statements are vulnerable.
2.  **Format String Bug in `PrintHeader()`:** This happens when a message has encoded non-ASCII characters in headers (RFC 2047), an unknown encoding, and encoded text that contains formatting codes. A `printf()` statement is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
*   The code is executed with the privileges of the user who ran the `metamail` program or a mail handling program that invoked `metamail`

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted email message containing specific MIME attachments.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered through various email clients or intermediate mail handling applications that use `metamail`. This includes mail readers, newsreaders, virus scanners, spam filters, and mail delivery agents.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send email messages to a vulnerable system.
*   No specific privileges or local access is required; exploitation can be achieved remotely via network email.

**Additional Details:**

*   The `metamail` package, while old, is still widely used in some environments and is often invoked automatically. This increases the risk of exploitation.
*   Proof-of-concept exploit code has been published for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by Ulf HÃ¤rnhammar
*   Patches were released by multiple Linux distributions including Slackware, Debian, Mandrake, and Red Hat.
*   The vulnerability was assigned two CVEs, CVE-2004-0104 for the format string bugs and CVE-2004-0105 for the buffer overflow (mentioned in the reports, but not the primary focus for CVE-2004-0104)
