- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Microsoft VM for Java allows the creation of covert channels between applets loaded from different websites due to the shared class loader for system classes. Public static non-final fields within these shared classes can be used to exchange information between applets from different origins.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Covert channel: Exploitation of shared class loader and public static fields allows for the exchange of information between applets violating the sandbox.
    - Cross-site information leakage: Information intended to be isolated to one applet's context can be accessed by another applet from a different origin, leading to data leakage.
    - Security zone violation: The ability to share information between applets from different origins could be exploited to bypass security restrictions.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Cross-site data leakage: An attacker can use covert channels to steal data from other applets.
    - Security zone violation: Exploitation can allow applets to bypass security restrictions and access information they should not have access to.

- **Attack vectors**: Loading two applets from different websites, where applet A sets a value into a shared hashtable using public static non-final fields, and applet B then reads this value using the same shared field.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host or control two different web servers. They can then host malicious applets, where one applet is used to write data and the other to read data using a shared class loader.
