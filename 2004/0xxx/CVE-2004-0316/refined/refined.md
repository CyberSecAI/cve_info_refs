Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Avirt Soho application fails to properly manage received strings on TCP ports 1080 and 8080, leading to buffer overflows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The application does not validate the length of input strings received on ports 1080 and 8080.  By sending overly long strings, the program attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer, which leads to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution is possible. By crafting the overflowing string with malicious code, an attacker could potentially gain control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:**  Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities remotely by sending crafted strings over the network to the affected ports.
    - Port 1080: Send a string of the form "GET aaaa[1113 of a]aaaa"
    - Port 8080: Send a string of the form "GET %%%%[2061 of %]%%%% HTTP/1.1"

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network connectivity to the Avirt Soho server.
- The attacker must be able to send TCP packets to ports 1080 and/or 8080 of the vulnerable server.
- No authentication is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content provides specific examples of how to trigger the vulnerability, including the length and format of the strings needed for each port.
- The vendor was contacted and is expected to release a fix in the next version of Avirt Soho.
