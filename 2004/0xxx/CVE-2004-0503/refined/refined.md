Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the described vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Microsoft Outlook 2003 handles embedded OLE objects, specifically Windows Media Player (WMP) objects, within rich text messages. It appears that Outlook fails to properly restrict the execution of media files, even when security settings are configured to block such actions. The vulnerability is also related to the exploitation of a URL redirection within the media file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **OLE Object Handling:** Outlook 2003 doesn't properly isolate and restrict OLE objects embedded in rich text emails, particularly WMP objects.
*   **Bypassed Security Restrictions:** The default "restricted zone" settings, which should prevent ActiveX controls, scripting, and file downloads, are circumvented.
*   **Media File Scripting:** Even with WMP settings to disallow scripting in media files, the embedded media file can trigger the execution of malicious content.
*   **URL Redirection:**  The attack uses a "0s URL flip" within the media file, which causes the embedded media object to access a malicious URL.
*   **IE Proxy:** The embedded media object uses Internet Explorer (IE) as a proxy to manipulate the recipient's machine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:**  By embedding a malicious WMP object with a crafted URL, an attacker can cause arbitrary code to execute on the recipient's machine.
*   **Silent Installation:** The attack can be delivered without any user interaction other than viewing/previewing the email. This facilitates silent installation of malware.
*   **Full Screen Video Ads:** The vulnerability can be used to display full-screen video advertisements upon opening/previewing the malicious email.
*   **System Compromise:** A successful exploit can compromise the recipient's machine, allowing for data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Email:** The primary attack vector is email. The attacker sends an email with a specially crafted rich text message.
*   **Embedded OLE Object:** The malicious payload is delivered via an embedded Windows Media Player OLE object.
*   **URL Redirection:** A malicious URL is embedded within the media file, leading to the exploitation of Internet Explorer via WMP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Craft Email:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a rich text email with an embedded malicious OLE object.
*   **Malicious Media File:** The attacker needs to create or obtain a media file that contains malicious code and/or redirects to a malicious URL.
*   **Mail Delivery:** The attacker must be able to send the malicious email to target recipients.

**Additional Notes from Content:**
*   The attack works even with default security settings of Outlook 2003.
*   Firewalls may flag Outlook's network activity, but embedding the entire payload negates the need for remote hosting.
*   The vulnerability was tested on XP and 2003 POP mail client settings. Exchange Server settings were unknown at the time of writing.
*   The author claims this is part of a multi-stage attack and references a previous advisory at `<http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/10307>`.
