The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in PowerPortal v1.x, a PHP-based content management system. These vulnerabilities include full path disclosure, cross-site scripting (XSS), and arbitrary directory browsing.

**A. Full Path Disclosure:**
*   **Root Cause:** The application displays the full server path within error messages when processing invalid image dimensions or directory paths.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper error handling and sanitization of input data, leading to verbose error messages that reveal the server's file system structure.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive server information, potentially aiding attackers in further exploitation by understanding the application's structure and file paths.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By accessing specific scripts (resize.php) with invalid parameters or by requesting invalid directory paths (modules.php), an attacker can trigger these error messages.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a remote attacker who can make HTTP requests to the web server.

**B. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when generating web pages.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation and output encoding allows arbitrary JavaScript code injection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other client-side attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By embedding malicious script tags in various URL parameters (e.g., `id`, `search`, `files`) within module requests an attacker can inject XSS payloads.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a remote attacker who can craft URLs containing malicious JavaScript code.

**C. Arbitrary Directory Browsing:**
*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly validate user-supplied paths in the `files` parameter, allowing the user to traverse up the directory structure.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input validation and path sanitization permit an attacker to access directories outside of the intended scope.
*   **Impact:** Attackers may be able to list or access sensitive files and directories, potentially leading to information leakage or further compromise of the system.
*  **Attack Vectors:** By using directory traversal sequences such as `../../../` in the `files` URL parameter, an attacker can navigate up the file system.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a remote attacker who can make HTTP requests to the web server.
