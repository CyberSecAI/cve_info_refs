  "related": true,
  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in how Weblogic Builder and the SecurityRoleAssignmentMBean.toXML method handle missing <principal-name> tags within the <security-role-assignment> tag in the weblogic.xml file.",

      ],
       "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to modify the weblogic.xml file. Once this modified file is parsed, the vulnerability will be triggered."
