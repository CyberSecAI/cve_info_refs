How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Klaus Kusche    2002-08-07 05:48:05 UTC  ``` Is it possible to propagate the CFLAGS settings from make.conf (at least march and mcpu, to hint alignment and instruction scheduling!) into the Makefiles of the kernel tree during emerge?  Kernel compiles still generate code optimized for the PPro (march=i686). ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2002-08-07 07:24:45 UTC  ``` the cpu optimization is handled through the .config file or the kernel ... in  other words, its something you change by using `make menuconfig` and setting up  the kernel yourself  i believe the default cpu is PPro ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Klaus Kusche    2002-08-07 07:54:08 UTC  ``` Tried it with menuconfig - does not have the desired effect (at least in the Gentoo crypto-2.4.19-r7 kernel): menuconfig offers "Pentium4", but even when "Pentium4" is selected, the kernel is built with "-march=i686" (i.e. PPro), not with "-march=pentium4" as expected.  I believe the kernel config mechanism has to limit its flags to the oldest gcc allowed for kernel compiles (2.72?) and hence will not use any flags introduced with gcc 3.[012]. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2002-08-07 08:09:33 UTC  ``` this is true, the kernel cant start using flags that are available in gcc3  cause that would piss off a lot people (and leave a lot more people in the dark  wondering why the damned thing wont compile)  or at least right now they cant :) maybe once ggc3 goes stable they'll consider it as an option with newer  kernels, but i highly doubt they'll ever support them in older ones ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Klaus Kusche    2002-08-07 08:52:26 UTC  ``` That's why I asked if the Gentoo linux ebuild could either patch the i386 arch Makefile or propagate the CFLAGS from make.conf into it dynamically, as described in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Michael Cohen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-09-02 20:12:31 UTC  ``` lolo-sources and mjc-sources use my gcc 3.1 optimization patch, which uses -march=pentium3/4/athlon/etc.   ``` |  |

# Gaim: New vulnerabilities — GLSA **200408-27**

Gaim contains several security issues that might allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code or commands.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-im/gaim** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.81-r5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.81-r5** |

### Background

Gaim is a multi-protocol instant messaging client for Linux which
supports many instant messaging protocols.

### Description

Gaim fails to do proper bounds checking when:

* Handling MSN messages (partially fixed with GLSA 200408-12).
* Handling rich text format messages.
* Resolving local hostname.
* Receiving long URLs.
* Handling groupware messages.
* Allocating memory for webpages with fake content-length
  header.

Furthermore Gaim fails to escape filenames when using drag and drop
installation of smiley themes.

### Impact

These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to crash Gaim or execute
arbitrary code or commands with the permissions of the user running
Gaim.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version of Gaim.

### Resolution

All gaim users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-im/gaim-0.81-r5"
 # emerge ">=net-im/gaim-0.81-r5"
```
