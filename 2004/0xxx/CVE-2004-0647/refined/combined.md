# Shorewall : Insecure temp file handling — GLSA **200407-07**

Shorewall contains a bug in the code handling the creation of temporary
files and directories. This can allow a non-root user to overwrite
arbitrary system files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-firewall/shorewall** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.4.10c** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.10f** |

### Background

Shorewall is a high level tool for configuring Netfilter, the firewall
facility included in the Linux Kernel.

### Description

Shorewall uses temporary files and directories in an insecure manner. A
local user could create symbolic links at specific locations,
eventually overwriting other files on the filesystem with the rights of
the shorewall process.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary
system files with root privileges, resulting in Denial of Service or
further exploitation.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users should upgrade to
the latest available version of Shorewall.

### Resolution

All users should upgrade to the latest available version of Shorewall,
as follows:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-firewall/shorewall-1.4.10f"
 # emerge ">=net-firewall/shorewall-1.4.10f"
```

The vulnerability can allow a non-root user to cause  arbitrary files on the system to be overwritten. LEAF Bering and Bering  uClibc users are generally not at risk due to the fact that LEAF boxes  do not typically allow logins by non-root users.  For 2.0 users, the problem is corrected in version 2.0.3a:  	<http://shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/shorewall-2.0.3a> 	ftp://shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/shorewall-2.0.3a  For 1.4 users, the correct version is:  	<http://shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/shorewall-1.4.10f> 	ftp://shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/shorewall-1.4.10f  I would appreciate immediate feedback on the 1.4.10f version; given that  I don't have any 1.4 systems remaining, I couldn't fully test that code." ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-30 06:24:29 UTC  ``` Martin : could you have a look and bump accordingly ? ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Martin Holzer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-01 05:16:51 UTC  ``` 2.0.3a and 1.4.10f are in cvs  adding arch-maintainers to mark at least 1.4.10f stable. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-01 06:25:14 UTC  ``` Thanks Martin. alpha,ppc,x86,sparc : please test and mark 1.4.10f stable.  ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Bryan Østergaard (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-02 16:20:58 UTC  ``` 1.4.10f marked stable on alpha. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Jason Wever (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-03 11:47:08 UTC  ``` Stable on sparc. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-05 14:08:18 UTC  ``` GLSA drafted: security please review. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-08 02:21:46 UTC  ``` GLSA is ready.
