## HTTP Parsing Vulnerabilities in Check Point Firewall-1

#### Vulnerability Note VU#790771

Original Release Date: 2004-02-05 | Last Revised: 2004-04-23

---

### Overview

Several versions of Check Point Firewall-1 contain a vulnerability that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

### Description

| The HTTP Security Servers component of Check Point Firewall-1 contains an HTTP parsing vulnerability that is triggered by sending an invalid HTTP request through the firewall. When Firewall-1 generates an error message in response to the invalid request, a portion of the input supplied by the attacker is included in the format string for a call to sprintf().  Researchers at [Internet Security Systems](http://www.iss.net/) have determined that it is possible to exploit this format string vulnerability to execute commands on the firewall. The researchers have also determined that this vulnerability can be exploited as a heap overflow, which would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. In either case, the commands or code executed by the attacker would run with administrative privileges, typically "SYSTEM" or "root". For more information, please see the [ISS advisory](http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/alerts/id/162). |
