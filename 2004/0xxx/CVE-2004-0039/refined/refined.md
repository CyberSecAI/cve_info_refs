Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2004-0039

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The HTTP Security Servers component of Check Point Firewall-1 has a vulnerability due to improper parsing of HTTP requests. Specifically, an invalid HTTP request can trigger the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** When an error message is generated in response to an invalid HTTP request, user-supplied data from the attacker is included in the format string for the `sprintf()` function. This allows an attacker to manipulate the format string, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Heap Overflow:** The vulnerability can also be exploited as a heap overflow, allowing an attacker to write beyond the allocated memory boundaries, which can also be leveraged to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected firewall.
- **Administrative Privileges:** The code is executed with administrative privileges, typically "SYSTEM" on Windows or "root" on Unix-based systems. This grants the attacker full control over the firewall.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The attack is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit it remotely by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the firewall.
- **HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends invalid HTTP requests through the firewall, triggering the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the firewall.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific vulnerability and how to craft an HTTP request to exploit it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present only when the HTTP Security Servers feature is enabled.
- Check Point has released a patch to address this vulnerability.
- Disabling the HTTP Security Servers feature is a workaround to mitigate the vulnerability if patching isn't immediately feasible.
- The vulnerability was discovered and researched by Mark Dowd of ISS X-Force.
