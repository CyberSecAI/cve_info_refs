> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

RHSA-2004:245 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2004-06-14
Updated:
2004-06-14
# RHSA-2004:245 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

apache, mod\_ssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Updated httpd and mod\_ssl packages that fix minor security issues in
the Apache Web server are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and
freely-available Web server.

A buffer overflow was found in the Apache proxy module, mod\_proxy, which
can be triggered by receiving an invalid Content-Length header. In order
to exploit this issue, an attacker would need an Apache installation
that was configured as a proxy to connect to a malicious site. This would
cause the Apache child processing the request to crash. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0492 to this issue.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux platforms Red Hat believes this issue cannot
lead to remote code execution. This issue also does not represent a Denial
of Service attack as requests will continue to be handled by other Apache
child processes.

A stack buffer overflow was discovered in mod\_ssl which can be triggered if
using the FakeBasicAuth option. If mod\_ssl is sent a client certificate
with a subject DN field longer than 6000 characters, a stack overflow can
occur if FakeBasicAuth has been enabled. In order to exploit this issue
the carefully crafted malicious certificate would have to be signed by a
Certificate Authority which mod\_ssl is configured to trust. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0488 to this issue.

This update also fixes a DNS handling bug in mod\_proxy.

The mod\_auth\_digest module is now included in the Apache package and should
be used instead of mod\_digest for sites requiring Digest authentication.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users of the Apache HTTP Server should upgrade
to these erratum packages, which contains Apache version 1.3.27 with
backported patches correcting these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade. Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated. Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated. Note that you
can also use wildcards (\*.rpm) if your current directory \*only\* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network. Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate. The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=125704#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2004-06-10 13:26:32 UTC  ``` A security issue has been reported in mod_proxy.  See  <http://www.guninski.com/modproxy1.html>  We have assigned [CAN-2004-0492](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-0492) to this issue.  The flaw affects Apache httpd 1.3.25 to 1.3.31 inclusive that have mod_proxy enabled and configured.  Apache httpd 2.0 is unaffected.  The security issue is a buffer overflow which can be triggered by getting mod_proxy to connect to a remote server which returns an invalid (negative)  Content-Length.  This results in a memcpy to the heap with a large length value, which will in most cases cause the Apache child to crash.  This does not represent a significant Denial of Service attack as requests will continue to be handled by other Apache child processes.  In order to exploit this issue an attacker would need to get an Apache installation that was configured as a proxy to connect to a malicious site.  For Red Hat Enterprise Linux we do not believe that this issue can lead to arbitrary code execution.   A patch to correct this issue is available.  See: <http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=108687304202140>  Public Jun10   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=125704#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2004-06-11 07:41:18 UTC  ``` Even though this is mitigated to being a minor issue we will produce an update for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, including a fix for [bug #122637](show_bug.cgi?id=122637 "CLOSED ERRATA - mod_proxy does reverse DNS lookups (AS2.1)") and [CAN-2004-0488](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-0488).  RHSA-2004:245 in QA   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=125704#c2)  Mark J. Cox    2004-06-14 15:46:11 UTC  ```  An errata has been issued which should help the problem  described in this bug report. This report is therefore being  closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files,  please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report  if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2004-245.html>    ``` |  |

[Red Hat Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) Program](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cve_program)

## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)

Red Hat engages with partners, vendors, researchers, and community coordinators to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and services. Multi-party coordination is a complex process, and understanding the parties' vulnerability disclosure policies, vulnerability handling policies, and contractual agreements opens the way to trusted communication and collaboration. Increasing transparency between parties assures that vendors can understand and manage the risk imposed by the vulnerability and facilitate engagements with other parties. The aim of CVD is to provide timely and consistent guidance to parties and customers to help them protect themselves.

Please see the [Red Hat CNA Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cna_vulnerability_disclosure_policy) for details on how Red Hat discloses security vulnerabilities under the Red Hat/Fedora scope.

# Apache: Buffer overflow in mod\_ssl — GLSA **200406-05**

A bug in mod\_ssl may allow a remote attacker to execute remote code when
Apache is configured a certain way.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-www/mod\_ssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.8.18** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.8.18** |

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.0.49-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | < **2.0**>= **2.0.49-r3** |

### Background

Apache is the most popular Web server on the Internet. mod\_ssl provides
Secure Sockets Layer encryption and authentication to Apache 1.3. Apache 2
contains the functionality of mod\_ssl.

### Description

A bug in the function ssl\_util\_uuencode\_binary in ssl\_util.c may lead to a
remote buffer overflow on a server configured to use FakeBasicAuth that
will trust a client certificate with an issuing CA with a subject DN longer
than 6k.

### Impact

Given the right server configuration, an attacker could cause a Denial of
Service or execute code as the user running Apache, usually
"apache". It is thought to be impossible to exploit this to
execute code on the x86 platform, but the possibility for other platforms
is unknown. This does not preclude a DoS on x86 systems.

### Workaround

A server should not be vulnerable if it is not configured to use
FakeBasicAuth and to trust a client CA with a long subject DN.

### Resolution

Apache 1.x users should upgrade to the latest version of mod\_ssl:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-www/mod_ssl-2.8.18"
 # emerge ">=net-www/mod_ssl-2.8.18"
```

Apache 2.x users should upgrade to the latest version of Apache:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.49-r3"
 # emerge ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.49-r3"
```
