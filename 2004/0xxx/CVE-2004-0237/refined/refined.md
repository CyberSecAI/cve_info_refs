- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Aprox PHP Portal allows viewing arbitrary files due to insufficient input sanitization. The `show` parameter in the URL is directly used to specify the file path without proper validation, leading to directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory Traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read any file on the server's file system that the web server user has access to, including sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd`.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a URL with the `show` parameter set to a file path, an attacker can read files on the server. Example: `http://targethost/index.php?show=/etc/passwd`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. No special access is needed, making it easily exploitable by anyone who can reach the web server.
