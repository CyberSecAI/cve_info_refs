- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inconsistent implementation and interpretation of MIME Content-Transfer-Encoding mechanisms across different vendors. Some vendors may not recognize or correctly process non-standard or variations of standard encoding types like "uue", "x-uue", or "x-uuencode" for uuencode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of strict adherence to MIME standards and the acceptance of variations or non-standard encoding mechanisms in security products. Security products may fail to properly decode or identify malicious content if it is encoded using a method they do not recognize. The affected products fail to either block malformed messages or fail to interpret the MIME field/message. This inconsistent handling of MIME encoding can be exploited to bypass security controls.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By using a MIME encoding that is recognized by a client agent (e.g., email client or browser) but not by a security product, attackers can deliver malicious payloads (such as file attachments with viruses or executable code) that would otherwise be blocked. This can lead to various security breaches, including malware infections or unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through MIME messages, specifically by using variations in the Content-Transfer-Encoding field. This can be done via email, web requests, or other protocols that use MIME.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft MIME messages using non-standard or variant encoding mechanisms. The attacker also needs to identify a target where the client application can interpret the chosen encoding method, while the security products protecting the target fail to recognize it.
