Root cause of vulnerability:
The Netgear FVS318 VPN Router Web-Based Administration has a vulnerability that allows a user to deny access to the web-based administration.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
The web-based administration allows a limited number of concurrent connections.

Impact of exploitation:
A user can establish 7 connections to the web-based administration port (80), which prevents the router administrator from accessing the web-based administration until those 7 connections are closed. This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition for the web-based management interface.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability can be exploited by establishing multiple connections to the web-based administration port.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to connect to the web-based administration port (80).
