 Summary:           Exposure of System Information
 Advisory ID:       TSSA-2004-020-ES
 Date:              2004-08-16
 Affected Products: tinysofa enterprise server 2.0

 ===========================================================================

 Description
 -----------

    rsync [[0]](#0) is a program for synchronizing files over a network.

    A vulnerability [[1]](#1) has been reported in rsync, which potentially can be
    exploited by malicious users to read or write arbitrary files on a
    vulnerable system.

    The vulnerability is caused due to an input validation error within the
    "sanitize_path()" function of the "util.c" file.

    Successful exploitation requires that the rsync daemon isn't running
    chrooted.

    The vulnerability affects version 2.6.2 and prior.

 Resolution
 ----------

    The rsync package has been updated to address this vulnerability.

# rsync: Potential information leakage — GLSA **200408-17**

rsync fails to properly sanitize paths. This vulnerability could allow the
listing of arbitrary files and allow file overwriting outside module's path
on rsync server configurations that allow uploading.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/rsync** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.6.0-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.6.0-r3** |

### Background

rsync is a utility that provides fast incremental file transfers. It is
used to efficiently synchronize files between hosts and is used by
emerge to fetch Gentoo's Portage tree. rsyncd is the rsync daemon,
which listens to connections from rsync clients.

### Description

The paths sent by the rsync client are not checked thoroughly enough.
It does not affect the normal send/receive filenames that specify what
files should be transferred. It does affect certain option paths that
cause auxilliary files to be read or written.

### Impact

When rsyncd is used without chroot ("use chroot = false" in the
rsyncd.conf file), this vulnerability could allow the listing of
arbitrary files outside module's path and allow file overwriting
outside module's path on rsync server configurations that allows
uploading. Both possibilities are exposed only when chroot option is
disabled.

### Workaround

You should never set the rsync daemon to run with "use chroot = false".

### Resolution

All users should update to the latest version of the rsync package.

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-misc/rsync-2.6.0-r3"
 # emerge ">=net-misc/rsync-2.6.0-r3"
```
