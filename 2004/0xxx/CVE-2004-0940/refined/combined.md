How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Apache HTTP Server 1.3 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 1.3. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 1.3 has had no new releases since 2010 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before March 2010. Subsequent issues may have affected 1.3 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 1.3.42

### moderate: mod\_proxy overflow on 64-bit systems ([CVE-2010-0010](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0010))

An incorrect conversion between numeric types flaw was found in the mod\_proxy module which affects some 64-bit architecture systems. A malicious HTTP server to which requests are being proxied could use this flaw to trigger a heap buffer overflow in an httpd child process via a carefully crafted response.

A buffer overflow was found in the Apache proxy module, mod\_proxy, which can be triggered by receiving an invalid Content-Length header. In order to exploit this issue an attacker would need to get an Apache installation that was configured as a proxy to connect to a malicious site. This would cause the Apache child processing the request to crash, although this does not represent a significant Denial of Service attack as requests will continue to be handled by other Apache child processes. This issue may lead to remote arbitrary code execution on some BSD platforms.

A client submitting a carefully constructed URI could cause a General Protection Fault in a child process, bringing up a message box which would have to be cleared by the operator to resume operation. This vulnerability introduced no identified means to compromise the server other than introducing a possible denial of service.

| Update 1.3.20 released | 2001-05-22 |
| --- | --- |
| Affects | 1.3.20, 1.3.19?, 1.3.17?, 1.3.14?, 1.3.12?, 1.3.11?, 1.3.9?, 1.3.6?, 1.3.4?, 1.3.3?, 1.3.2?, 1.3.1?, 1.3.0? |

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 1.3.19

### important: Requests can cause directory listing to be displayed ([CVE-2001-0925](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0925))

The default installation can lead mod\_negotiation and mod\_dir or mod\_autoindex to display a directory listing instead of the multiview index.html file if a very long path was created artificially by using many slashes.

| Update 1.3.19 released | 2001-02-28 |
| --- | --- |
| Affects | 1.3.17, 1.3.14, 1.3.12, 1.3.11 |

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 1.3.14

### moderate: Requests can cause directory listing to be displayed on NT ([CVE-2000-0505](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-0505))

A security hole on Apache for Windows allows a user to view the listing of a directory instead of the default HTML page by sending a carefully constructed request.

| Update 1.3.14 released | 2000-10-13 |
| --- | --- |
| Affects | 1.3.12, 1.3.11?, 1.3.9?, 1.3.6?, 1.3.4?, 1.3.3?, 1.3.2?, 1.3.1?, 1.3.0? |

### important: Rewrite rules that include references allow access to any file ([CVE-2000-0913](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-0913))

The Rewrite module, mod\_rewrite, can allow access to any file on the web server. The vulnerability occurs only with certain specific cases of using regular expression references in RewriteRule directives: If the destination of a RewriteRule contains regular expression references then an attacker will be able to access any file on the server.

| Issue public | 2000-09-29 |
| --- | --- |
| Update 1.3.14 released | 2000-10-13 |
| Affects | 1.3.12, 1.3.11?, 1.3.9?, 1.3.6?, 1.3.4?, 1.3.3?, 1.3.2?, 1.3.1?, 1.3.0? |

### important: Mass virtual hosting can display CGI source ([CVE-2000-1204](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-1204))

A security problem for users of the mass virtual hosting module, mod\_vhost\_alias, causes the source to a CGI to be sent if the cgi-bin directory is under the document root. However, it is not normal to have your cgi-bin directory under a document root.

| Update 1.3.14 released | 2000-10-13 |
| --- | --- |
| Affects | 1.3.12, 1.3.11, 1.3.9 |

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 1.3.12

### important: Cross-site scripting can reveal private session information ([CVE-2000-1205](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-1205))

Apache was vulnerable to cross site scripting issues. It was shown that malicious HTML tags can be embedded in client web requests if the server or script handling the request does not carefully encode all information displayed to the user. Using these vulnerabilities attackers could, for example, obtain copies of your private cookies used to authenticate you to other sites.

| Update 1.3.12 released | 2000-02-25 |
| --- | --- |
| Affects | 1.3.11, 1.3.9, 1.3.6, 1.3.4, 1.3.3, 1.3.2, 1.3.1, 1.3.0 |

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 1.3.11

### moderate: Mass virtual hosting security issue ([CVE-2000-1206](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-1206))

A security problem can occur for sites using mass name-based virtual hosting (using the new mod\_vhost\_alias module) or with special mod\_rewrite rules.

| Update 1.3.11 released | 2000-01-21 |
| --- | --- |
| Affects | 1.3.9, 1.3.6?, 1.3.4?, 1.3.3?, 1.3.2?, 1.3.1?, 1.3.0? |

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 1.3.2

### important: Multiple header Denial of Service vulnerability ([CVE-1999-1199](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1199))

A serious problem exists when a client sends a large number of headers with the same header name. Apache uses up memory faster than the amount of memory required to simply store the received data itself. That is, memory use increases faster and faster as more headers are received, rather than increasing at a constant rate. This makes a denial of service attack based on this method more effective than methods which cause Apache to use memory at a constant rate, since the attacker has to send less data.

| Update 1.3.2 released | 1998-09-23 |
| --- | --- |
| Affects | 1.3.1, 1.3.0 |

________________________________________________________________________

Package:             apache
Vulnerability:       arbitrary code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:        Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= apache-1.3.32-20041028 >= apache-1.3.33-20041029
OpenPKG 2.2          <= apache-1.3.31-2.2.0    >= apache-1.3.31-2.2.1
OpenPKG 2.1          <= apache-1.3.31-2.1.5    >= apache-1.3.31-2.1.6
OpenPKG 2.0          <= apache-1.3.29-2.0.6    >= apache-1.3.29-2.0.7 (*)
                     (*) actually already end-of-life

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a vendor announcement [[1]](#1), a vulnerability exists in
  the Apache HTTP server [[0]](#0), version 1.3. The problem is a potential
  buffer overflow in the "get_tag" function of Apache's SSI module
  "mod_include". It allows local users who can create SSI documents
  to execute arbitrary code as the Apache run-time user via SSI
  documents that trigger a content length calculation error. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2004-0940 [[2]](#2) to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/openpkg
  rpm -q apache". If you have the "apache" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution) [3][[4]](#4).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][[6]](#6), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][[8]](#8) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[9]](#9), build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [[3]](#3) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [[4]](#4). For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.2, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.2/UPD
  ftp> get apache-1.3.31-2.2.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig apache-1.3.31-2.2.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild apache-1.3.31-2.2.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/apache-1.3.31-2.2.1.*.rpm

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : apache
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0940

Two vulnerabilities have been identified in the Apache 1.3 webserver:

CAN-2004-0940

    "Crazy Einstein" has discovered a vulnerability in the
    "mod_include" module, which can cause a buffer to be overflown and
    could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

NO VULN ID

    Larry Cashdollar has discovered a potential buffer overflow in the
    htpasswd utility, which could be exploited when user-supplied is
    passed to the program via a CGI (or PHP, or ePerl, ...) program.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.26-0woody6.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.33-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache packages.
