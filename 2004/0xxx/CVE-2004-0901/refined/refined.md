- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unchecked buffer in the Word for Windows 6.0 Converter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow. The converter fails to validate the length of a message before passing it to an allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to take complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, and creating new accounts with full privileges.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending a malicious file to a user and persuading them to open it.
    - Hosting a website that exploits the vulnerability and persuading a user to visit it and open the malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to send a crafted malicious document to the victim. The victim must then open the document using WordPad for the exploit to occur. User interaction is required.
