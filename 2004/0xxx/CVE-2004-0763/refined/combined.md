1. Topic:

Updated mozilla, galeon and epiphany packages that fix multiple
vulnerabilities are now available.

Mozilla is an open-source Web browser, designed for standards
compliance, performance, and portability.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

Note that some of these issues have already been fixed in Redhat 9 and
Fedora Core 1. Please refer to previous advisories for details.

NISCC testing of implementations of the S/MIME protocol uncovered a number
of bugs in NSS versions prior to 3.9. The parsing of unexpected ASN.1
constructs within S/MIME data could cause Mozilla to crash or consume large
amounts of memory. A remote attacker could potentially trigger these bugs
by sending a carefully-crafted S/MIME message to a victim. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0564 to this issue.

Andreas Sandblad discovered a cross-site scripting issue that affects
various versions of Mozilla. When linking to a new page it is still
possible to interact with the old page before the new page has been
successfully loaded. Any Javascript events will be invoked in the context
of the new page, making cross-site scripting possible if the different
pages belong to different domains. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0191 to
this issue.

Flaws have been found in the cookie path handling between a number of Web
browsers and servers. The HTTP cookie standard allows a Web server
supplying a cookie to a client to specify a subset of URLs on the origin
server to which the cookie applies. Web servers such as Apache do not
filter returned cookies and assume that the client will only send back
cookies for requests that fall within the server-supplied subset of URLs.
However, by supplying URLs that use path traversal (/../) and character
encoding, it is possible to fool many browsers into sending a cookie to a
path outside of the originally-specified subset. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0594 to this issue.

Zen Parse reported improper input validation to the SOAPParameter object
constructor leading to an integer overflow and controllable heap
corruption. Malicious JavaScript could be written to utilize this flaw and
could allow arbitrary code execution. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0722 to
this issue.

During a source code audit, Chris Evans discovered a buffer overflow and
integer overflows which affect the libpng code inside Mozilla. An attacker
could create a carefully crafted PNG file in such a way that it would cause
Mozilla to crash or execute arbitrary code when the image was viewed.
(CAN-2004-0597, CAN-2004-0599)

Zen Parse reported a flaw in the POP3 capability. A malicious POP3 server
could send a carefully crafted response that would cause a heap overflow
and potentially allow execution of arbitrary code as the user running
Mozilla. (CAN-2004-0757)

Marcel Boesch found a flaw that allows a CA certificate to be imported with
a DN the same as that of the built-in CA root certificates, which can cause
a denial of service to SSL pages, as the malicious certificate is treated
as invalid. (CAN-2004-0758)

Met - Martin Hassman reported a flaw in Mozilla that could allow malicious
Javascript code to upload local files from a users machine without
requiring confirmation. (CAN-2004-0759)

Mindlock Security reported a flaw in ftp URI handling. By using a NULL
character (%00) in a ftp URI, Mozilla can be confused into opening a
resource as a different MIME type. (CAN-2004-0760)

Mozilla does not properly prevent a frame in one domain from injecting
content into a frame that belongs to another domain, which facilitates
website spoofing and other attacks, also known as the frame injection
vulnerability. (CAN-2004-0718)

Tolga Tarhan reported a flaw that can allow a malicious webpage to use a
redirect sequence to spoof the security lock icon that makes a webpage
appear to be encrypted. (CAN-2004-0761)

Jesse Ruderman reported a security issue that affects a number of browsers
including Mozilla that could allow malicious websites to install arbitrary
extensions by using interactive events to manipulate the XPInstall Security
dialog box. (CAN-2004-0762)

Emmanouel Kellinis discovered a caching flaw in Mozilla which allows
malicious websites to spoof certificates of trusted websites via
redirects and Javascript that uses the "onunload" method. (CAN-2004-0763)

Mozilla allowed malicious websites to hijack the user interface via the
"chrome" flag and XML User Interface Language (XUL) files. (CAN-2004-0764)

The cert_TestHostName function in Mozilla only checks the hostname portion
of a certificate when the hostname portion of the URI is not a fully
qualified domain name (FQDN). This flaw could be used for spoofing if an
attacker had control of machines on a default DNS search path. (CAN-2004-0765)

Jesse Ruderman discovered a cross-domain scripting bug in Mozilla. If
a user is tricked into dragging a javascript link into another frame or
page, it becomes possible for an attacker to steal or modify sensitive
information from that site. Additionally, if a user is tricked into
dragging two links in sequence to another window (not frame), it is
possible for the attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0905 to this issue.

Gael Delalleau discovered an integer overflow which affects the BMP
handling code inside Mozilla. An attacker could create a carefully crafted
BMP file in such a way that it would cause Mozilla to crash or execute
arbitrary code when the image is viewed. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0904 to
this issue.

Georgi Guninski discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the vCard
display routines. An attacker could create a carefully crafted vCard file
in such a way that it would cause Mozilla to crash or execute arbitrary
code when viewed. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0903 to this issue.

Wladimir Palant discovered a flaw in the way javascript interacts with
the clipboard. It is possible that an attacker could use malicious
javascript code to steal sensitive data which has been copied into the
clipboard. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0908 to this issue.

Georgi Guninski discovered a heap based buffer overflow in the "Send
Page" feature. It is possible that an attacker could construct a link in
such a way that a user attempting to forward it could result in a crash or
arbitrary code execution. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0902 to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit
<http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs/> for directions on how to configure yum
and apt-get.

I get at least 4 dialogs warning me about this certificate, at least one of
which says that this isn't the right cert for this site. Is this really an issue?

|  | |

That message appears because of a misconfiguration on the shellcity.net site,
which is unrelated to this bug. I picked that site as it was the first I could
think of that had SSL set up. If you can think of another site where ssl is
setup properly you can substitute the URL in the testcase.

Okay, that testcase works. I get the lock icon. This still isn't a really big
issue, but it should be fixed.

| [Comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=253121#c6)• 20 years ago |
|  | |

This is a very big issue. People rely on that icon to determine whether or not
the site is "safe". I could make a fake paypal site and use that technique to
make it look as though it is the real paypal site, and collect credit card
numbers. These certificates are critical, their entire purpose is to confirm
that the site you \*are\* dealing with is in fact the site you \*think\* you are
dealing with. This vulnerability allows someone to completely bypass this
security measure.

| [Comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=253121#c7)• 20 years ago |
|  | |

When I view the testcase, I get a lock icon (incorrect and bad), but I see
"bugzilla.mozilla.org" in the URL bar and when I double-click the lock icon.

| [Comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=253121#c8)• 20 years ago |
|  | |

Stating the obvious: has anyone tested this on seamonkey?
Also, from Jesse's comment, does this really need to be "critical"? You have to
actually go to "View Certificate" to see the spoofed site's name. The only
thing actually being spoofed here is the lock icon.

|  | |

jruderman@gmail.com:
That is the one spot where the correct site is actually listed. Try clicking
"View" from the security tab to see the full cert. Result: the paypal info is
displayed.
luser\_bugzilla@perilith.com:
The actual cert itself is spoofed, so this is more than a cosmetic issue. I am
assuming that the reason that b.m.o is shown in the initial dialog is because
that information is retrieved independantly of the cert. The cert details are
still wrong.

I could not find a matching bug report, so I got worried for a moment. Glad
you're already working on this.
Here's a summary from the bug I opened, just in case it might help:
---------------------
I got this link from a post in some Israeli forum. The sample spoofing page was
provided by the person who wrote that post (aparently not somebody who likes
Mozilla).
The link for the full-disclosure message is:
<http://lists.netsys.com/pipermail/full-disclosure/2004-July/024372.html>
That person also provided a test page for the issue (sorry for the message
there, as I mentioned that person does not seem to be a Mozilla lover):

I still need to test that, but the idea is to forget the security information we
got from the channel when some \*other\* window calls document.open() on this
document (anyone can call document.open(), no same-origin checks done there).
IOW, if I do:
w=window.open("<http://www.paypal.com>");
w will open and show a locked icon, if I then do:
w.document.open();
w.document.write("not secure any more");
w.document.close();
we should make sure we do \*not\* display the lock icon any more.
Needs testing still.

Ok, tested that and that case works now too. But after chatting with bz we
decided to change this a bit and in stead of just dropping our reference to our
security info when document.write is called etc, we'll grab the security info
from the calling document in stead, that way, if a secure site does
document.open() on a document that's not secure, it'll become secure (and the
URL bar will reflect the source of the document.open() call etc). New patch
coming up...Status: NEW → ASSIGNED

it's mostly the same as before, and let me know if my explanation didn't make
sense.

wouldn't "mixed-content" make more sense? calling the content secure when it
may not be entirely secure seems somewhat wrong.

Agreed. I just ran across it on bugtraq, and it could be nice publicity to have
this kind of response time... though it would be nice if we had an easy patching

The bug title has "onunload" in it.
Would it be useful to have the onunload( ) hook disabled by default? It
doesn't have many positive uses.
In other words onunload handlers in web content would not be run unless
the user had gone to the trouble of enabling this feature ...

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20060316 Firefox/1.6a1
The testcase in [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=253121#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - lock icon and certificates spoofable with onunload document.write") shows:
1. <https://www.paypal.com/> in the URL bar
2. A black padlock at the right of the status bar
3. www.paypal.com at the right of the status bar
4. A blank page
There was a transient title of 'Spoofer' and some flickering text saying "Enter
...", before the blank page was fully displayed.
Given [comment 53](/show_bug.cgi?id=253121#c53 "VERIFIED FIXED - lock icon and certificates spoofable with onunload document.write") , it might be a good idea for somebody else to check on the
padlock icon and the status bar - perhaps I am on the wrong lines somewhere

Loading the testcase in [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=253121#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - lock icon and certificates spoofable with onunload document.write"), I see "Insert fake paypal site here. See security icon in lower left.", but the URL bar and status bar indicate that I'm on bugzilla.mozilla.org.
Ben, do you see chrome JS errors in the JavaScript console when you load it? (You'll have to set javascript.options.showInConsole in about:config to true before testing.)

Irrespective of the javascript config setting, I get this message:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x804b003d [nsIDOMNSLocation.reload]" nsresult: "0x804b003d (<unknown>)" location: "JS frame :: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=154374&action=view> :: onunload :: line 1" data: no]
When I turn on that setting, I see the same as you do. Turning the setting off,
I can reproduce what I said in [comment 58](/show_bug.cgi?id=253121#c58 "VERIFIED FIXED - lock icon and certificates spoofable with onunload document.write") . I will try with a nightly.

Testing with the Bon Echo alpha (and a new profile) shows the "Insert fake paypal site here. See security icon in lower left." message in full, but the status
bar correctly says "bugzilla.mozilla.org". Nothing in the javascript console, and in general the same as [comment 60](/show_bug.cgi?id=253121#c60 "VERIFIED FIXED - lock icon and certificates spoofable with onunload document.write") .

A popular Web browser,good alternative of IE and
"The web browser" for linux machines,
used to view pages on the World Wide Web.

Bug
===

Firefox has caching problem, as a result of that someone can
spoof a certificate of any website and use it as his/her own.
The problem is exploited using onunload inside  < body> and
redirection using Http-equiv Refresh metatag,document.write()
and document.close()

First you direct the redirection metatag to the website
of which you want to spoof the certificate, then inside
the < body> tag you add onulnoad script so you can control
the output inside the webpage with the spoofed certificate.

After that you say to firefox, as soon as you unload this page
close the stream, aparently the stream you close is
the redirection website, you do that with
document.close().

Now you can write anything you want , you do that
using document.write(). After writing the content of you choice
you close the stream again , usually firefox wont display your content,
although if you check the source code you see it , so the last thing
is to refresh the new page (do that using window.location.reload()),
after that you have your domain name in the url field , your content
in the browser and the magic yellow Lock on the bottom left corner,
if you pass your mouse over it you will see displayed the name of
the website you spoofed the certificate, if you double click on it you
will check full information of the certificate without any warning !

You dont need to have SSL in your website ! it will work with
http.

Additional using this bug malicious websites can bypass content
filtering using SSL properties.

=====================
Proof Of Concept Code
=====================

< HTML>
< HEAD>
< TITLE>Spoofer< /TITLE>
< META HTTP-EQUIV="REFRESH" CONTENT="0;URL=<https://www.example.com>">
< /HEAD>
< BODY
onunload="
document.close();
document.writeln('< body onload=document.close();break;>
            < h3>It is Great to Use example's Cert!');

document.close();
window.location.reload();
">
< /body>

# Mozilla, Firefox, Thunderbird, Galeon, Epiphany: New releases fix vulnerabilities — GLSA **200408-22**

### Background

Mozilla is a popular web browser that includes a mail and newsreader.
Galeon and Epiphany are both web browsers that use gecko, the Mozilla
rendering engine. Mozilla Firefox is the next-generation browser from
the Mozilla project that incorporates advanced features that are yet to
be incorporated into Mozilla. Mozilla Thunderbird is the
next-generation mail client from the Mozilla project.

### Description

Mozilla, Galeon, Epiphany, Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird
contain the following vulnerabilities:

* All Mozilla tools use libpng for graphics. This library contains a
  buffer overflow which may lead to arbitrary code execution.
* If a user imports a forged Certificate Authority (CA) certificate,
  it may overwrite and corrupt the valid CA already installed on the
  machine.

Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox, and other gecko-based browsers also contain a
bug in their caching which may allow the SSL icon to remain visible,
even when the site in question is an insecure site.

### Impact

Users of Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox, and other gecko-based browsers are
susceptible to SSL certificate spoofing, a Denial of Service against
legitimate SSL sites, crashes, and arbitrary code execution. Users of
Mozilla Thunderbird are susceptible to crashes and arbitrary code
execution via malicious e-mails.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround for most of these vulnerabilities. All
users are advised to upgrade to the latest available version.

### Resolution

All users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv your-version
 # emerge your-version
```

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
