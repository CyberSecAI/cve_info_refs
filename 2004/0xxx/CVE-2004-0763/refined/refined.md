  "cve": "CVE-2004-0763",
  "description": "Emmanouel Kellinis discovered a caching flaw in Mozilla which allows malicious websites to spoof certificates of trusted websites via redirects and Javascript that uses the \"onunload\" method.",
  "affected_products": [
    "Mozilla",
    "Firefox",
    "Thunderbird",
    "Galeon",
    "Epiphany"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A caching flaw related to how security information is handled during page redirects and JavaScript's `onunload` event.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The browser does not properly update or validate the security context after a redirect, particularly when an onunload event is used in conjunction with document.write() and document.close().",
        "The browser does not transfer the security context from the original page when document.open() is called from another window."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious website can spoof the certificate of a trusted website, making it appear to the user that they are on a secure site when they are not. This can lead to phishing attacks where users may enter sensitive data on a fraudulent page believing it to be legitimate.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious webpage utilizes a redirect sequence combined with Javascript using the `onunload` method, `document.write()`, and `document.close()` functions to spoof a secure website's certificate."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website that can perform a redirect and execute JavaScript."
