       "details": "The vulnerability occurs when parsing the PathName argument from a LoginExt packet requesting authentication using the Cleartext Password User Authentication Method (UAM). The PathName argument consists of a one-byte string type, two-bytes specifying the string length, and the string itself. An AFPName (0x3) string that exceeds the declared length overflows a fixed-size stack buffer."
