Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2004-0711 (Note: While the provided content doesn't explicitly state the CVE ID, it refers to vulnerability VU#184558, which is associated with CVE-2004-0711)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how BEA WebLogic Server handles URL pattern matching. Specifically, it incorrectly interprets URL patterns ending with `*` instead of `/*` as wildcard patterns, leading to inconsistent behavior across different versions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Incorrect wildcard matching:** The server incorrectly treats patterns like `/mydir*` as equivalent to `/mydir/*`, which is the correct way to specify a wildcard in URL patterns.
-   **Inconsistent behavior:** Older versions of WebLogic Server (6.x) treated the incorrect syntax (`/mydir*`) as a valid wildcard, but newer versions (7.x and later) do not, leading to previously protected URLs becoming unprotected without any notification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Bypass of URL restrictions:** A remote attacker can bypass URL access restrictions that were intended to be enforced via URL pattern matching.
-   **Unauthorized access:** This could allow unauthorized access to resources or functionalities that were meant to be protected.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Remote exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by crafting specific URLs.
-   **URL pattern manipulation:** The attack vector involves using URLs that take advantage of the server's flawed pattern-matching interpretation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected WebLogic Server.
-   **Understanding of the flawed pattern matching:** The attacker needs to understand how WebLogic Server interprets wildcard patterns to craft effective malicious URLs.

**Additional Notes**

-   The vulnerability is present in WebLogic Server versions 6.x, 7.x and 8.1.
-   The vulnerability is that an illegal URL pattern is treated the same as a legal URL pattern.

This detailed explanation provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its causes, potential impact, and how it could be exploited.
