        "Unspecified vulnerability in ActiveX control"
      ],
      "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is not known. In the case of a buffer overflow, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Internet Explorer. The attacker may also be able to cause a denial of service.",

      "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.",

An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions."

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run malicious script code in the Local Machine security zone in Internet Explorer or access information in a different domain.
