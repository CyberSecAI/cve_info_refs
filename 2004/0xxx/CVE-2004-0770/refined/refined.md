{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The dgen emulator uses insecure temporary files in /tmp when decompressing gzip and bzipped ROMs on the fly.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure use of temporary files",
      "Predictable temporary file names"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially overwrite or read the temporary files created by dgen, leading to possible data corruption or information disclosure. Although not explicitly stated, symlink attacks might also be a concern.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker could create files with the same name in /tmp before dgen creates them, potentially leading to overwrite attacks.",
        "An attacker could potentially create a symlink with the same name and redirect it somewhere else, leading to various other attacks."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have local access to the system where dgen is running."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The vulnerability was fixed by using mkstemp() to create temporary files securely, and by using fork/exec and pipes instead of system calls to decompress the ROM files."
  ],
    "cve_assigned": "CAN-2004-0770"
