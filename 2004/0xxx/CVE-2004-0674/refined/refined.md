- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Enterasys XSR Security Routers crash when processing a packet with the IP record route option.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of IP packets with the record route option.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service (DoS) due to device crash.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted IP packet containing the record route option.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the vulnerable device. The provided proof-of-concept uses `hping3` to send a ping with the `-G` option which sets the IP record route option.
