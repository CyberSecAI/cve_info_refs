- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The 12Planet Chat Server 2.9 does not properly filter input strings. Specifically, the server fails to sanitize input provided to the "page" parameter in the URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS). The server reflects unsanitized user input back to the user, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, redirection, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within the "page" parameter. If a user clicks on this link, the malicious script will be executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to click on the malicious link.
