The provided content details two vulnerabilities in WebCortex Webstores2000 version 6.0:

**Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection vulnerability**

*   **Root cause:**  User-supplied input to the `browse_items.asp` script is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation/sanitization, SQL injection.
*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker can gain administrative access to the shopping mall.
    *   An attacker can read any information from the database, including customer private data.
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server using the `xp_cmdshell` function.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending specially crafted input through the `Search_Text`, `Search_Dept`, `SEARCH_MINPRICE`, `SEARCH_MAXPRICE`, and `SEARCH_SKU` parameters to `browse_items.asp`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `browse_items.asp` page. They don't need prior access or authentication.

**Vulnerability 2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability**

*   **Root cause:** The `error.asp` script does not sanitize user-supplied input in the `Message_id` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of output encoding/escaping, Cross-site scripting (XSS).
*  **Impact:** A remote attacker can steal user session IDs by tricking a user into visiting a crafted URL, potentially gaining access to the user's personal data.
*   **Attack vector:** Crafting a URL with malicious JavaScript code injected into the `Message_id` parameter of the `error.asp` script, then tricking a user into visiting the crafted URL.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs and trick users to visit them.
