# Apache 2, mod\_dav: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200409-21**

Several vulnerabilities have been found in Apache 2 and mod\_dav for Apache
1.3 which could allow a remote attacker to cause a Denial of Service or a
local user to get escalated privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.51** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.51**< **2.0** |

| Package | **net-www/mod\_dav** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.0.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.3-r2** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP server is one of most popular web servers on the internet.
mod\_ssl provides SSL v2/v3 and TLS v1 support for it and mod\_dav is the
Apache module for Distributed Authoring and Versioning (DAV).

### Description

A potential infinite loop has been found in the input filter of mod\_ssl
(CAN-2004-0748) as well as a possible segmentation fault in the
char\_buffer\_read function if reverse proxying to a SSL server is being used
(CAN-2004-0751). Furthermore, mod\_dav, as shipped in Apache httpd 2 or
mod\_dav 1.0.x for Apache 1.3, contains a NULL pointer dereference which can
be triggered remotely (CAN-2004-0809). The third issue is an input
validation error found in the IPv6 URI parsing routines within the apr-util
library (CAN-2004-0786). Additionally a possible buffer overflow has been
reported when expanding environment variables during the parsing of
configuration files (CAN-2004-0747).

### Impact

A remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service either by aborting a SSL
connection in a special way, resulting in CPU consumption, by exploiting
the segmentation fault in mod\_ssl or the mod\_dav flaw. A remote attacker
could also crash a httpd child process by sending a specially crafted URI.
The last vulnerabilty could be used by a local user to gain the privileges
of a httpd child, if the server parses a carefully prepared .htaccess file.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache 2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.51"
 # emerge ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.51"
```

All mod\_dav users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-www/mod_dav-1.0.3-r2"
 # emerge ">=net-www/mod_dav-1.0.3-r2"
```

Debian Security Advisory DSA 558-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
October 6th, 2004                       <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : libapache-mod-dav
Vulnerability  : null pointer dereference
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0809

Julian Reschke reported a problem in mod_dav of Apache 2 in connection
with a NULL pointer dereference.  When running in a threaded model,
especially with Apache 2, a segmentation fault can take out a whole
process and hence create a denial of service for the whole server.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.3-3.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.3-10 of libapache-mod-dav and in version 2.0.51-1 of
Apache 2.

We recommend that you upgrade your mod_dav packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
