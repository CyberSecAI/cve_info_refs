Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2004-0809:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A NULL pointer dereference exists within the `mod_dav` module of Apache HTTP Server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The core issue is a NULL pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can trigger this vulnerability, leading to a segmentation fault (crash) of the httpd process.
- In a threaded model (especially with Apache 2), this crash can take down an entire process, causing a denial of service (DoS) for the whole server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is triggered remotely, by sending a specifically crafted request that exploits the NULL pointer dereference in mod_dav.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Apache server.

**Additional notes:**
- This vulnerability affects both Apache 2 and mod_dav 1.0.x for Apache 1.3.
- The vulnerability is present in mod_dav versions <= 1.0.3-r1.
- Patched versions are mod_dav >= 1.0.3-r2 and Apache >= 2.0.51.
- The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
