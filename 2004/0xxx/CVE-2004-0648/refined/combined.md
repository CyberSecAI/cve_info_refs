How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Mozilla fails to restrict access to the "shell:" URI handler

#### Vulnerability Note VU#927014

Original Release Date: 2004-07-09 | Last Revised: 2005-06-15

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way Mozilla and its derived programs handle certain types of links could allow an attacker to run local programs on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Versions of the [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/), [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/), and [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/) programs for Microsoft Windows will handle URIs of the form shell: and invoke external programs for certain file types. As a result, external programs located on the system can be invoked if the user clicks on this type of link in an HTML web page, email, or other source. In the event that the program being invoked contains a separate vulnerability, an attacker may be able to leverage the use of the shell: handler as a means to exploit that vulnerability.  Since the ability to invoke programs with the shell: moniker is handled natively by the Windows operating system, **any** program that passes these URIs off to the operating system (Internet Explorer, Outlook, etc.) exposes a similar vulnerability. Non-Windows versions of the mozilla products listed above do not expose this vulnerability because they do not handle the shell: URIs. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to invoke local programs on the vulnerable system. This could allow the attacker to exploit a separate vulnerability in the external program being invoked or execute malicious programs that were stored on the system by another means. The specific impact of such exploitation would be dependent on the nature of the vulnerability being exploited or the malicious program being invoked. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from the vendor**[The Mozilla Project](http://www.mozilla.org/) has published patches for this issue. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more information. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  **Disable the shell: protocol handler**Mozilla and Firefox users, particularly those who are unable to apply the patches supplied by the Mozilla Project, are encouraged to consider disabling the shell: protocol handler. This can be accomplished by adding the following line to the prefs.js file:user\_pref("network.protocol-handler.external.shell", false);**or** by following these steps:   1. Open the browser, type about:config into the location bar, and hit enter. 2. Right click on any value inside the window and select New -> Boolean. 3. A dialog box titled "New boolean value" should appear. Enter "network.protocol-handler.external.shell" (without the quotation marks) and hit enter. 4. A dialog box titled "Enter boolean value" should appear. Enter "false" into this box and hit enter. |
