{
  "CVE-2004-0643": {
    "Description": "The krb5_rd_cred() function in MIT Kerberos 5, in releases prior to krb5-1.3.2, contains a double-free vulnerability. When the ASN.1 decoder function decode_krb5_enc_cred_part() returns an error, krb5_rd_cred() explicitly frees the buffer returned by the decoder. However, the decoder itself already frees the buffer on error, leading to a double-free.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The krb5_rd_cred() function attempts to free memory that has already been freed by the ASN.1 decoder function, decode_krb5_enc_cred_part(), when an error occurs during decoding.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Double-free"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable host or a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote, authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Kerberos messages containing forwarded credentials to a vulnerable service.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, as the vulnerable code path is only reached after successful decryption of the encrypted part of the KRB-CRED message."
