{
  "CVE-2004-0782": {
    "Description": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the pixbuf_create_from_xpm() function of the GdkPixbuf library when parsing XPM image files. This can be triggered by an integer overflow when calculating the required buffer size, leading to a heap overflow when copying color data.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the calculation of the buffer size during XPM parsing.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could cause a denial-of-service by crashing the application or potentially execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the application by exploiting the heap overflow.",
    "Attack vectors": "By convincing a user to open a specially crafted XPM file.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious XPM file with specific values for 'n_col' and 'cpp' that trigger the integer overflow. No special privileges are required, just the ability to deliver the malicious file to the victim."
