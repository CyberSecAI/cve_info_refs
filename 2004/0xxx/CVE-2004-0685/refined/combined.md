How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=127921#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2004-07-15 11:59:16 UTC  ``` Back in October 2003 Arnaldo commited some fixes prior to 2.6 for some leaking info to userspace in the usb drivers: [http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/cset@3f986b35LyBKc-OxB8G6k22oOjgYTQ](http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/cset%403f986b35LyBKc-OxB8G6k22oOjgYTQ)  The corresponding changes have not been commited to 2.4, or included in the previous sparse fixes.  So I've assigned them [CAN-2004-0685](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-0685) (for 2.4 only, as they were fixed before 2.6.0).   Treat as public.  Only affects FC1   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=127921#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2004-07-28 10:43:32 UTC  ``` Now fixed upstream [http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.4/cset@410582380U3H9KOx8J2YZmMT0bhXQw](http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.4/cset%40410582380U3H9KOx8J2YZmMT0bhXQw)     ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=127921#c2)  Mark J.

## Linux kernel USB drivers do not initialize kernel memory properly

#### Vulnerability Note VU#981134

Original Release Date: 2004-10-22 | Last Revised: 2004-10-25

---

### Overview

Various Linux USB drivers contain an information disclosure vulnerability that may expose sensitive segments of kernel memory to users.

### Description

| USB drivers for several versions the Linux kernel do not properly initialize kernel memory before using it. When an affected USB driver copies uninitialized memory from kernel space to user space (with the copy\_to\_user function), the previous kernel memory contents will be copied as well. In some cases, this will grant a user inappropriate access to sensitive segments of kernel memory. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Users may be able to view sensitive segments of kernel memory. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Check with Vendor**  Users who suspect they are vulnerable are encouraged to check with their vendor to determine the appropriate action to take.**Upgrade to Unaffected Build of the Linux Kernel**Users are encouraged to upgrade to an unaffected build of the Linux kernel. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Background

The Linux kernel is responsible for managing the core aspects of a
GNU/Linux system, providing an interface for core system applications
as well as providing the essential structure and capability to access
hardware that is needed for a running system.

### Description

The Linux kernel allows a local attacker to obtain sensitive kernel
information by gaining access to kernel memory via several leaks in the
/proc interfaces. These vulnerabilities exist in various drivers which
make up a working Linux kernel, some of which are present across all
architectures and configurations.

CAN-2004-0415 deals with addressing invalid 32 to 64 bit conversions in
the kernel, as well as insecure direct access to file offset pointers
in kernel code which can be modified by the open(...), lseek(...) and
other core system I/O functions by an attacker.

CAN-2004-0685 deals with certain USB drivers using uninitialized
structures and then using the copy\_to\_user(...) kernel call to copy
these structures. This may leak uninitialized kernel memory, which can
contain sensitive information from user applications.

Finally, a race condition with the /proc/.../cmdline node was found,
allowing environment variables to be read while the process was still
spawning. If the race is won, environment variables of the process,
which might not be owned by the attacker, can be read.

### Impact

These vulnerabilities allow a local unprivileged attacker to access
segments of kernel memory or environment variables which may contain
sensitive information. Kernel memory may contain passwords, data
transferred between processes and any memory which applications did not
clear upon exiting as well as the kernel cache and kernel buffers.

This information may be used to read sensitive data, open other attack
vectors for further exploitation or cause a Denial of Service if the
attacker can gain superuser access via the leaked information.

### Workaround

There is no temporary workaround for any of these information leaks
other than totally disabling /proc support - otherwise, a kernel
upgrade is required. A list of unaffected kernels is provided along
with this announcement.

### Resolution

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest available sources for
their system:

```
 # emerge sync
 # emerge -pv your-favorite-sources
 # emerge your-favorite-sources

 # # Follow usual procedure for compiling and installing a kernel.
 # # If you use genkernel, run genkernel as you would normally.
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
