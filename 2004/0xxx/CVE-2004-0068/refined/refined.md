Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the way PhpDig 1.6.x includes files, specifically in the `config.php` file. The `$relative_script_path` variable, which is used to construct file paths for inclusion, can be manipulated by an attacker. This allows the attacker to inject a malicious URL into `$relative_script_path`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unvalidated Input:** The `$relative_script_path` variable is not properly validated or sanitized before being used in the `include` statements. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary values into the variable.
*   **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** Due to the lack of validation, the attacker can control the path of the included file. This can lead to the inclusion of malicious files from a remote server, allowing for remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** By injecting a malicious URL, an attacker can cause the web server to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could allow the attacker to gain complete control of the server, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or denial of service.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  The included code would execute with the privileges of the web server user (typically `nobody`).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attack:** An attacker injects a malicious URL into the `$relative_script_path` variable. This is likely done via an HTTP request by manipulating parameters passed to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server running PhpDig.
*   **Understanding of Input Parameters:** The attacker needs to be aware of the input parameters that can be manipulated to affect the value of `$relative_script_path`.
