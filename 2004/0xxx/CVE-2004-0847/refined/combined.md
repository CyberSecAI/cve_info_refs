Windows Update will now offer these updates to customers. Customers who have already installed the cumulative update MS07-040 will not need to apply MS05-004.

**Why did Microsoft reissue this bulletin on August 8, 2006?**

Subsequent to the release of this bulletin, it was determined that the vulnerability addressed also affects Microsoft Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition for .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1. Microsoft has updated the bulletin with additional information about Microsoft Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition for .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1 in the âAffected Softwareâ section.

**Why did Microsoft reissue this bulletin on June 14, 2005?**

Subsequent to the release of this bulletin, it was determined that the update for .NET Framework 1.0 Service Pack 3 for the following operating system versions: Windows XP Tablet PC Edition and Windows XP Media Center Edition was failing to install when distributed through SMS or AutoUpdate. The updated package corrects this behavior\*\*.\*\*

**If I already applied the original release of the update to my machine, do I need to install the re-released version of the update?**

No, only customers that attempted distribution through SMS or used Automatic Update will need to apply the re-released version of the update for the following:

NET Framework 1.0 Service Pack 3 for the following operating system versions

* Windows XP Tablet PC Edition
* Windows XP Media Center Edition

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine if this update is required?**

No. MBSA does not currently support the detection of .NET Framework. For detailed information about the programs that MBSA currently does not detect, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460).

However, Microsoft has made available an [Enterprise Update Scanning Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) (EST) to assist customers with the detection of needed security updates not currently supported by MBSA.

**What is the** **Enterprise** **Update Scanning Tool (EST)?**

As part of an ongoing commitment to provide detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft is delivering a stand-alone detection tool for all bulletins during a MSRC release cycle which cannot be detected by the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) or the Office Detection Tool (ODT). This standalone tool is referred to as an Enterprise Update Scanning Tool or EST and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a detection tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers will be able to run the tool from a command line interface (CLI), and view the results of the XML output file. In order to help customers better utilize the tool, [detailed documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) will be provided with the tool.
There is also a version of the tool that [SMS](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894154) customers can obtain that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.

**Can I use a version of the** **Enterprise** **Update Scanning Tool (EST) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. Microsoft has created a version of the EST that will determine if you need to apply this update for all of the products listed under Affected Products above. [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 984193](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) describes the EST in detail, as well as provides a download link to the tool. There is also a version of this tool that SMS customers can obtain. See the following [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 894154](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894154).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. SMS uses MBSA for detection; therefore, SMS has the same limitation listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA does not detect. However, there is a version of the [EST](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894154) that SMS customers can obtain that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.
For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

The Security Update Inventory Tool is required for detecting Microsoft Windows and other affected Microsoft products. For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460)

## Vulnerability Details

#### Path Validation Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0847.

A canonicalization vulnerability exists in ASP.NET that could allow an attacker to bypass the security of an ASP.NET Web site and gain unauthorized access. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take a variety of actions, depending on the specific contents of the website.

#### Mitigating Factors for Path Validation Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0847:

* Vulnerability only affects sites that require authenticated access.

#### Workarounds for Path Validation Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0847:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* Apply the mitigation code module discussed in Microsoft Knowledge Base article [887289](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/887289). The mitigation code module provides protection on a server-basis.
* An alternative to installing the module on a per application-basis is to make the following change to the global.asax file in the application root directory for each application on an affected system:
  <script runat=server language=cs>void Application\_BeginRequest(object src, EventArgs e) { if (Request.Path.IndexOf('\\') >= 0 || System.IO.Path.GetFullPath(Request.PhysicalPath) != Request.PhysicalPath) { throw new HttpException(404, "not found"); }}</script>
* Install and Use URLScan. URLScan will help protect against a large number of issues stemming from improperly formed URL requests including the publicly described issues addressed by this bulletin. URLScan does not protect your system as comprehensively as either the mitigation code module or the global.asax script below. Information on URLScan is available here [https:](https://).

#### FAQ for Path Validation Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0847:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability that could lead to an elevation privilege in some cases. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass the security of an ASP.NET Web site and gain unauthorized access. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take a variety of actions, depending on the specific contents of the Web site.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The canonicalization routine that is used by ASP.NET to map the request does not correctly parse the URL.

**What is ASP.NET?**

[ASP.NET](https://www.asp.net/) is collection of technologies within the.NET Framework that enable developers to build Web applications and XML Web Services.
Unlike traditional Web pages, which use a combination of static HTML and scripting, ASP.NET uses compiled, event-driven pages. This enables developers to build Web-based applications with the same richness and functionality usually associated with applications built in languages such as Visual Basic or Visual C++. Unlike desktop applications, however, these complied pages generate information that is sent to client desktops or browsers using markup languages such as HTML and XML. This enables developers to build applications with broad functionality, yet project a user interface to devices and systems running many operating systems.
Because ASP.NET is a Web-based application environment, it requires an underlying Web server to provide basic HTTP functionality. For this reason, ASP.NET runs on top of IIS 5.0 on Windows 2000, IIS 5.1 on Windows XP and IIS 6.0 on Windows Server 2003.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain unauthorized access to parts of a Web site. The actions the attacker could take would depend on the specific content being protected.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted URL to the affected system could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted URL and sending the URL to an affected system, which could then allow the attacker to bypass the Web siteâs security.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Internet facing systems are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. In addition, internal Web sites that use ASP.NET to host sensitive data can be at risk from this vulnerability.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet.

**I have already applied the ASP.NET ValidatePath Module (887290) listed in the workarounds section of the bulletin. Do I still need to apply this Security Update?**

Yes. While the mitigation is effective, it is still important to apply the security update which removes the vulnerability.

**Do I need to uninstall the ASP.NET ValidatePath Module (887290) before applying this update?**

No. The module and security update can exist on a system at the same time, although this security update provides all of the benefits that the module does, so it is safe to remove the module once the update is installed.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that ASP.NET validates url paths.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CAN-2004-0847](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2004-0847).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. When the security bulletin was released, Microsoft had received information that this vulnerability was being exploited.
