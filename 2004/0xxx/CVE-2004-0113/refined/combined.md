# Apache HTTP Server 2.0 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.0. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 2.0 has had no new releases since 2013 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before August 2013. Subsequent issues may have affected 2.0 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.0.65

### moderate: apr\_fnmatch flaw leads to mod\_autoindex remote DoS ([CVE-2011-0419](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0419))

A flaw was found in the apr\_fnmatch() function of the bundled APR library. Where mod\_autoindex is enabled, and a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

Workaround: Setting the 'IgnoreClient' option to the 'IndexOptions' directive disables processing of the client-supplied request query arguments, preventing this attack.

Resolution: Update APR to release 1.4.5 (bundled with httpd 2.2.19) or release 0.9.20 (bundled with httpd 2.0.65)

Acknowledgements: This issue was reported by Maksymilian Arciemowicz

### important: Range header remote DoS ([CVE-2011-3192](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3192))

A flaw was found in the way the Apache HTTP Server handled Range HTTP headers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd to use an excessive amount of memory and CPU time via HTTP requests with a specially-crafted Range header. This could be used in a denial of service attack. Advisory: CVE-2011-3192.txt

### moderate: mod\_proxy reverse proxy exposure ([CVE-2011-3368](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3368))

An exposure was found when using mod\_proxy in reverse proxy mode. In certain configurations using RewriteRule with proxy flag or ProxyPassMatch, a remote attacker could cause the reverse proxy to connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing sensitive information from internal web servers not directly accessible to attacker. No update of 1.3 will be released.

Patches will be published to https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply\_to\_1.3.42/

### important: mod\_isapi module unload flaw ([CVE-2010-0425](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0425))

A flaw was found with within mod\_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod\_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

### low: Subrequest handling of request headers (mod\_headers) ([CVE-2010-0434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0434))

A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy of the headers\_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod\_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

### low: mod\_cache and mod\_dav DoS ([CVE-2010-1452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1452))

A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod\_cache (2.2) and mod\_dav (2.0 and 2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM. This issue is further mitigated as mod\_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod\_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers" directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.

Acknowledgements: This issue was reported by Mark Drayton.

| Update 2.0.43 released | 2002-10-03 |
| Update 1.3.27 released | 2002-10-03 |
| Affects | 2.0.42, 2.0.40, 2.0.39, 2.0.37, 2.0.36, 2.0.35, 1.3.26, 1.3.24, 1.3.22, 1.3.20, 1.3.19, 1.3.17, 1.3.14, 1.3.12, 1.3.11, 1.3.9, 1.3.6, 1.3.4, 1.3.3, 1.3.2, 1.3.1, 1.3.0 |

### moderate: CGI scripts source revealed using WebDAV ([CVE-2002-1156](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1156))

In Apache 2.0.42 only, for a location where both WebDAV and CGI were enabled, a POST request to a CGI script would reveal the CGI source to a remote user.

| Update 2.0.43 released | 2002-10-03 |

| Affects | 2.0.42 |

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.0.42

### moderate: mod\_dav crash ([CVE-2002-1593](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1593))

A flaw was found in handling of versioning hooks in mod\_dav. An attacker could send a carefully crafted request in such a way to cause the child process handling the connection to crash. This issue will only result in a denial of service where a threaded process model is in use.

| Issue public | 2002-09-19 |

| Update 2.0.42 released | 2002-09-24 |
| Affects | 2.0.40, 2.0.39, 2.0.37, 2.0.36, 2.0.35 |

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.0.40

### low: Path revealing exposures ([CVE-2002-0654](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0654))

A path-revealing exposure was present in multiview type map negotiation (such as the default error documents) where a module would report the full path of the typemapped .var file when multiple documents or no documents could be served. Additionally a path-revealing exposure in cgi/cgid when Apache fails to invoke a script. The modules would report "couldn't create child process /path-to-script/script.pl" revealing the full path of the script.

### important: Path vulnerability ([CVE-2002-0661](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0661))

Certain URIs would bypass security and allow users to invoke or access any file depending on the system configuration. Affects Windows, OS2, Netware and Cygwin platforms only.

### critical: Apache Chunked encoding vulnerability ([CVE-2002-0392](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0392))

Malicious requests can cause various effects ranging from a relatively harmless increase in system resources through to denial of service attacks and in some cases the ability to execute arbitrary remote code.

# Multiple security vulnerabilities in Apache 2 — GLSA **200403-04**

A memory leak in mod\_ssl allows a remote denial of service attack against
an SSL-enabled server via plain HTTP requests. Another flaw was found when
arbitrary client-supplied strings can be written to the error log, allowing
the exploit of certain terminal emulators. A third flaw exists with the
mod\_disk\_cache module.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.0.48** |
| Unaffected versions | = **1.3\***>= **2.0.49** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems. The goal of this
project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that
provides services in tune with the current HTTP standards.

### Description

Three vulnerabilities were found:

1. A memory leak in ssl\_engine\_io.c for mod\_ssl in Apache 2.0.48 and below
   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service attack via plain
   HTTP requests to the SSL port of an SSL-enabled server.
2. Apache fails to filter terminal escape sequences from error logs that
   begin with the ASCII (0x1B) sequence and are followed by a series of
   arguments. If a remote attacker could inject escape sequences into an
   Apache error log, the attacker could take advantages of weaknesses in
   various terminal emulators, launching attacks against remote users
   including further denial of service attacks, file modification, and the
   execution of arbitrary commands.
3. The Apache mod\_disk\_cache has been found to be vulnerable to a weakness
   that allows attackers to gain access to authentication credentials
   through the issue of caching HTTP hop-by-hop headers which would
   contain plaintext user passwords. There is no available resolution for
   this issue yet.

### Impact

No special privileges are required for these vulnerabilities. As a
result, all users are recommended to upgrade their Apache
installations.

### Workaround

There is no immediate workaround; a software upgrade is required. There
is no workaround for the mod\_disk\_cache issue; users are recommended to
disable the feature on their servers until a patched version is
released.

### Resolution

Users are urged to upgrade to Apache 2.0.49:

```
 # emerge sync
 # emerge -pv ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.49"
 # emerge ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.49"

 # ** IMPORTANT **

 # If you are migrating from Apache 2.0.48-r1 or earlier versions,
 # it is important that the following directories are removed.

 # The following commands should cause no data loss since these
 # are symbolic links.

 # rm /etc/apache2/lib /etc/apache2/logs /etc/apache2/modules
 # rm /etc/apache2/modules

 # ** ** ** ** **

 # ** ALSO NOTE **

 # Users who use mod_disk_cache should edit their Apache
 # configuration and disable mod_disk_cache.
```

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
