  "additionalDetails": [
    "The vulnerability is located in the `ssl_engine_io.c` file within the mod_ssl module of Apache httpd.",
     "The issue occurs because the SSL structure is not freed when a plain HTTP request is sent to an SSL-enabled port, leading to a memory leak for each such request.",
    "The fix involves modifying the `ssl_io_filter_disable` function to free the SSL structure, preventing the memory leak.",
