How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## The zlib compression library is vulnerable to a denial-of-service condition

#### Vulnerability Note VU#238678

Original Release Date: 2004-10-01 | Last Revised: 2005-10-05

---

### Overview

Un-handled error conditions in the zlib compression library may allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| There is a vulnerability in the error handling mechanisms of the decompression functions in the zlib compression library. The decompression functions inflate() and inflateBack() fail to handle certain error conditions properly. If an un-handled error condition is raised, the application linked to zlib may abruptly and abnormally terminate. This vulnerability may be exploited locally or remotely depending on the application being attacked.  This issue exists in zlib versions 1.2.0.x and 1.2.x, other versions are not vulnerable. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A malicious user may be able to intentionally raise an un-handled error condition by supplying the vulnerable functions with specially crafted compressed data. As a result, applications linked to the zlib library may abruptly and abnormally terminate resulting in a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Check with Vendor**Users who suspect they are vulnerable are encouraged to check with their vendor to determine the appropriate action to take. Please see the list of vendors we have notified below. |

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Probably, though the release and security teams are already aware.  It
will be fixed in -6.

Description:
  Triggered by a Debian bug report [[1]](#1), a denial of service vulnerability
  was found in the ZLib compression library [[0]](#0) versions 1.2.x
  (older versions are not affected). The problem arises from incorrect
  error handling in the inflate() and inflateBack() functions. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2004-0797 [[2]](#2) to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/openpkg
  rpm -q zlib". If you have the "zlib" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution) and its dependent packages (see above) as well [3][[4]](#4).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][[6]](#6), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][[8]](#8) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[9]](#9), build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [[3]](#3) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [[4]](#4). For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.1, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.1/UPD
  ftp> get zlib-1.2.1-2.1.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig zlib-1.2.1-2.1.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild zlib-1.2.1-2.1.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/zlib-1.2.1-2.1.1.*.rpm

  Additionally, rebuild and reinstall any other dependent packages (see
  above) already installed in your OpenPKG instance. Only updating the
  "zlib" package is NOT sufficient because of the statically linked old
  "libz.a" code residing in the executables of other dependent packages.

  Due to transitive dependencies and because "zlib" is used by such many
  other libraries and programs, the convenient way to upgrade "zlib" and
  all affected packages is to use the "openpkg-tools" package:

  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg build -Ua | sh

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# zlib: Denial of service vulnerability — GLSA **200408-26**

The zlib library contains a Denial of Service vulnerability.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-libs/zlib** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.2.1-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.1-r3** |

### Background

zlib is a general-purpose data-compression library.

### Description

zlib contains a bug in the handling of errors in the "inflate()" and
"inflateBack()" functions.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch a Denial of
Service attack on any application using the zlib library.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version of zlib.

### Resolution

All zlib users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=sys-libs/zlib-1.2.1-r3"
 # emerge ">=sys-libs/zlib-1.2.1-r3"
```

You should also run revdep-rebuild to rebuild any packages that depend
on older versions of zlib :

```
 # revdep-rebuild
```
