# Apache: Exposure of protected directories — GLSA **200409-33**

A bug in the way Apache handles the Satisfy directive can lead to the
exposure of protected directories to unauthorized users.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | = **2.0.51** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.51-r1**< **2.0.51** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP server is one of most popular web servers on the Internet.

### Description

A bug in the way Apache handles the Satisfy directive, which is used to
require that certain conditions (client host, client authentication, etc)
be met before access to a certain directory is granted, could allow the
exposure of protected directories to unauthorized clients.

### Impact

Directories containing protected data could be exposed to all visitors to
the webserver.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.51-r1"
 # emerge ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.51-r1"
```

# Apache HTTP Server 2.0 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.0. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 2.0 has had no new releases since 2013 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before August 2013. Subsequent issues may have affected 2.0 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.0.65

### moderate: apr\_fnmatch flaw leads to mod\_autoindex remote DoS ([CVE-2011-0419](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0419))

A flaw was found in the apr\_fnmatch() function of the bundled APR library. Where mod\_autoindex is enabled, and a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

Workaround: Setting the 'IgnoreClient' option to the 'IndexOptions' directive disables processing of the client-supplied request query arguments, preventing this attack.

Resolution: Update APR to release 1.4.5 (bundled with httpd 2.2.19) or release 0.9.20 (bundled with httpd 2.0.65)

### low: APR apr\_palloc heap overflow ([CVE-2009-2412](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2412))

A flaw in apr\_palloc() in the bundled copy of APR could cause heap overflows in programs that try to apr\_palloc() a user controlled size. The Apache HTTP Server itself does not pass unsanitized user-provided sizes to this function, so it could only be triggered through some other application which uses apr\_palloc() in a vulnerable way.

### important: mod\_isapi module unload flaw ([CVE-2010-0425](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0425))

A flaw was found with within mod\_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod\_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

### low: Subrequest handling of request headers (mod\_headers) ([CVE-2010-0434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0434))

A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy of the headers\_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod\_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

### low: mod\_cache and mod\_dav DoS ([CVE-2010-1452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1452))

A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod\_cache (2.2) and mod\_dav (2.0 and 2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM. This issue is further mitigated as mod\_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod\_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers" directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.

### moderate: mod\_proxy crash ([CVE-2007-3847](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-3847))

A flaw was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod\_proxy module. On sites where a reverse proxy is configured, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would cause the Apache child process handling that request to crash. On sites where a forward proxy is configured, an attacker could cause a similar crash if a user could be persuaded to visit a malicious site using the proxy. This could lead to a denial of service if using a threaded Multi-Processing Module.

### important: listening socket starvation ([CVE-2004-0174](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0174))

A starvation issue on listening sockets occurs when a short-lived connection on a rarely-accessed listening socket will cause a child to hold the accept mutex and block out new connections until another connection arrives on that rarely-accessed listening socket. This issue is known to affect some versions of AIX, Solaris, and Tru64; it is known to not affect FreeBSD or Linux.
