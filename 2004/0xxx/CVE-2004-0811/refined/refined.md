Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2004-0811:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A bug in Apache HTTP Server 2.0.51 in the way it handles the `Satisfy` directive. Specifically, it broke the merging of `Satisfy` directives configured in different contexts (e.g., directory and location), causing the access control to be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper merging of access control directives.
- Incorrect implementation of the `Satisfy` directive logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Protected directories and resources, intended to be restricted by authentication requirements, become accessible to unauthorized users. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure or unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  A remote attacker can access protected resources without proper authentication due to the broken `Satisfy` directive merging.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Apache web server.
- The attacker needs no prior authentication to access resources that should have been protected.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Apache HTTP Server version 2.0.51.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves upgrading to version 2.0.52 or later which correctly merges the `Satisfy` directives.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200409-33) specifically mentions that a bug in the way Apache handles the Satisfy directive could lead to the exposure of protected directories to unauthorized users. This is a more detailed description than the CVE, and confirms that the vulnerability allows bypassing authentication requirements.
- The Fedora update notification confirms that the update to `httpd-2.0.51-2.7` includes the fix for this vulnerability.
