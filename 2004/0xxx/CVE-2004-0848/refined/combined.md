## Vulnerability Details

#### Buffer Overrun in Microsoft Office XP Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0848:

A vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office XP software that could allow remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Buffer Overrun in Microsoft Office XP Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0848:

* This vulnerability could only be exploited by an attacker who persuaded a user to open a malicious file hosted in Internet Explorer or click on a link in an email message.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
* Customers running Microsoft ISA 2004 as their web proxy have the ability to reject questionable URL's by utilizing an HTTP Filter Signature. For information on HTTP Filtering in ISA 2004, see the [product documentation.](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/isa/2004/plan/httpfiltering.mspx)

#### Workarounds for Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Microsoft Office XP - CAN-2004-0848:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* Enable prompting for office documents. By default, Internet Explorer will prompt the user to Open/Save As the document.
  **Note** If this functionally has been turned off the documents will automatically be opened.

  To re-enable this functionality, follow these steps:

  1. Double-click on the **My Computer** icon on your desktop or in the start menu right-click **My Computer** and select **Explore**.
  2. From the **Tools** menu, select **Folder Options**.
  3. On the **File Types** tab, for each Office file type, highlight and click **Advanced**.
  4. In the dialog box that is displayed, verify that the **Confirm open after download** setting is checked. Also, uncheck **Browse in same window** if it is checked.

  **Impact of Workaround:**

  Microsoft Office will now prompt the user to Open/Save As instead of allowing for malicious code to automatically be run.

#### FAQ for Buffer Overrun in Microsoft Office XP Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0848:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges

**What causes the vulnerability?**

A buffer overrun in the process that passes URL file locations to Microsoft Office XP software.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any user who could persuade another user to open a specially-crafted html link can attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could seek to exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially-crafted html link that references malicious code. The attacker could then send this to a user, typically through an e-mail message, and then persuade the user to click on the link.
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability.
An attacker could also attempt to compromise a Web site to have it display a Web page with malicious content. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers are only at risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative credentials are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Microsoft Works Suite is listed as a vulnerable product - why?**

Microsoft Works Suite includes Microsoft Word. Microsoft Works users should use [Office Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21135) to detect and to install the appropriate update.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Office XP validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Microsoft Office XP contains buffer overflow vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#416001

Original Release Date: 2005-02-09 | Last Revised: 2005-02-09

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow in Microsoft Office XP may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft Office XP is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. According to [MS05-005](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-005.mspx), the buffer overflow exists in the process that passes URL file locations to Microsoft Office XP software. Please note that customers using Microsoft ISA 2004 as their web proxy are at less risk because ISA 2004 rejects the URL in question by default when handling proxy client requests.  For more information about this issue including the versions of Office affected and remediation techniques, please see MS05-005. |
| --- |

### Impact

| If a remote attacker can persuade a user to access a specially crafted HTML file or hyperlink using a vulnerable Office application, that attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch** Microsoft has released Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-005 to address this issue. |
| --- |

| **Do Not Access Unsolicited HTML Files or Click Unsolicited Hyperlinks**By only accessing HTML file or clicking hyperlinks form known or trusted sources, the chances of exploitation are reduced. |
