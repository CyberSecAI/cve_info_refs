## Vulnerability Details

#### Indexing Service Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0897:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Indexing Service because of the way that it handles query validation. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious query that could potentially allow remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. While remote code execution is possible, an attack would most likely result in a denial of service condition.

#### Mitigating Factors for Indexing Service Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0897:

* The Indexing Service is not enabled by default on the affected systems.
* Even when the Indexing Service is installed, by default it is not accessible from Internet Information Services (IIS). Manual steps are required to enable (IIS) to become a Web-based interface for the Indexing Service. By default the Indexing Service is used only to perform local and remote file system queries. Web-based query pages must be created or installed manually that will allow IIS to receive queries from anonymous users and pass those queries to the Indexing Service.
* Only users with permissions to access the manually created or installed queries pages would be able to attempt to exploit this vulnerability through IIS. If these Web-based query pages require authenticated access, anonymous users would not be able to exploit this vulnerable through IIS.
* If none of the Web-based query methods have been manually enabled, only authenticated users would be able to attempt to exploit this vulnerability through remote file system queries.
* Windows 2000 is not affected by this vulnerability. However the additional security-related change does affect Windows 2000 and we recommend customers install this update.
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for Indexing Service Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0897:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Block the following at the firewall:**

  + **UDP ports 137 and 138 and TCP ports 139 and 445**

  These ports could be used to initiate a connection with the Indexing Service to perform file system based queries. Blocking them at the firewall will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability through these ports. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports.
* **Use a personal firewall such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33335)**, which is included with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.**

  If you use the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP or in Windows Server 2003 to help protect your Internet connection, it blocks unsolicited inbound traffic by default. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet.

  To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

  To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
  3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  5. Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you want to enable the use of some programs and services through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, protocols, and services that are required.
* **Enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798).
* **Block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).
* **Remove the Indexing Service if you do not need it:**

  If the Indexing Service is no longer needed, you could remove it by following this procedure.

  To configure components and services:

  1. In Control Panel, open **Add or Remove Programs**.
  2. Click **Add/Remove Windows Components**.
  3. Click to clear the Indexing Service check box to remove the Indexing Service.
  4. Complete the Windows Components Wizard by following the instructions on the screen.
* You could modify any web pages that use the Index Service to block queries longer than 60 characters. [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 890621](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/890621) provides more information on how to perform these steps.

#### FAQ for Indexing Service Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0897:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full privileges. While remote code execution is possible, an attack would most likely result in a denial of service condition. There are also significant mitigating factors that exist that helps reduce the severity of this vulnerability. For more information see the Mitigating Factors section of the security bulletin.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the Indexing Service.

**What is Indexing Service?**

The Indexing Service is a base service for the affected operating systems. Formerly known as Index Server, its original function was to index the content of Internet Information Services (IIS) Web servers. Indexing Service now creates indexed catalogs for the contents and properties of both file systems and virtual Webs.
The Indexing Service is available to applications and scripts for providing an efficient means of managing, querying, and indexing information in file systems or Web servers. Indexing Service also provides query mechanisms for efficiently accessing the information in the catalogs. The indexed information results from filtering the file systems and the Web servers using Microsoft-supplied filters and, optionally, custom-supplied filters.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

On systems where administrators have manually performed multiple steps and have enabled an anonymous Web-based query interface through Internet Information Services (IIS) to the Indexing Service, any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could attempt to exploit this vulnerability. By default, the Indexing Service does not enable the Web-based query interface. However, the Indexing Service does listen on the local network interface for communication requests by default. Any authenticated user could attempt to exploit this vulnerable by sending a specially-crafted network packet to the Indexing Service. This vulnerability could also be used locally by an authenticated user to attempt a local elevation of privilege attack.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems that have the Indexing Service enabled are primarily at risk from this vulnerability from local or network based attacks. Systems that have the Indexing Service accessible through IIS are at risk from this vulnerability from Internet based attacks. If the Indexing Service is not enabled the system would not be vulnerable to this issue. None of the affected systems enable the Indexing Service by default.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could attempt to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet. Microsoft has provided information on how you can help protect your PC. End users can visit the [Protect Your PC Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21169). IT Professionals can visit the [Security Center Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21171).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Indexing Service validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Notes** The Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 version of this security update is packaged as a dual-mode package. Dual-mode packages contain files for the multiple versions of the affected operating system. For more information about dual-mode packages, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 328848](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/328848).
When you install this security update on Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 the installer checks to see if any of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system.

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

## Microsoft Windows Indexing Service fails to properly handle query validation

#### Vulnerability Note VU#657118

Original Release Date: 2005-01-20 | Last Revised: 2005-01-20

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the Microsoft Indexing Service could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.

### Description

| The Microsoft [Indexing Service](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/indexsrv/html/ixintro_03l1.asp) provides applications and scripts with a means of managing, querying, and indexing information in file systems or web servers. It is included as a base service on some versions of Windows. A vulnerability exists in the way that the Indexing Service uses an unchecked buffer in the handling of queries. An attacker with the ability to supply a long, specially-crafted query to the Indexing Service may be able to exploit this vulnerability. Additional details about the nature of the query malformation exploiting this vulnerability are unknown.  The level of exposure to a vulnerable system is dependent on how the Indexing Service is configured:     + If the Indexing Service is not accessible through the web server (IIS), then the vulnerability could only be exploited by a local, authenticated attacker + If the Indexing Service is accessible through IIS, then the vulnerability could be exploited by a remote attacker + If access controls have been placed on the query pages, only authenticated remote attackers would be able to exploit this vulnerability + If access controls have not been placed on the query pages, any anonymous remote attacker would be able to exploit this vulnerability |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to execute code of their choosing on an affected system by constructing a malicious query. The attacker-supplied code would be executed with Local System privileges, resulting in a complete system compromise. Microsoft reports that while remote code execution is possible, an attack would most likely result in a denial of service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from the vendor**Microsoft Security has published Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-003](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-003.mspx) in response to this issue. Users are encouraged to review this bulletin and apply the patches it refers to. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  Microsoft has published the following workarounds in [MS05-003](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-003.mspx). Users, particularly those who are unable to apply the patches, should consider implementing these workarounds.  Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.     | • | **Block the following at the firewall:**  | • | **UDP ports 137 and 138 and TCP ports 139 and 445** | | --- | --- |  These ports could be used to initiate a connection with the Indexing Service to perform file system based queries. Blocking them at the firewall will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability through these ports. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | • | **Use a personal firewall such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=33335)**, which is included with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.** If you use the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP or in Windows Server 2003 to help protect your Internet connection, it blocks unsolicited inbound traffic by default. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet.  To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:   | 1. | Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**. | | --- | --- | | 2. | In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet. |  To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:  | 1. | Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**. | | --- | --- | | 2. | In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**. | | 3. | Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**. | | 4. | Click the **Advanced** tab. | | 5. | Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**. |  **Note** If you want to enable the use of some programs and services through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, protocols, and services that are required. | | • | **Enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.** You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798). | | • | **Block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.** Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878). | | • | **Remove the Indexing Service if you do not need it:**  If the Indexing Service is no longer needed, you could remove it by following this procedure.  To configure components and services:   | 1. | In Control Panel, open **Add or Remove Programs**. | | --- | --- | | 2. | Click **Add/Remove Windows Components**. | | 3. | Click to clear the Indexing Service check box to remove the Indexing Service. | | 4. | Complete the Windows Components Wizard by following the instructions on the screen. | | | • | You could modify any web pages that use the Index Service to block queries longer than 60 characters. [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 890621](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/890621) provides more information on how to perform these steps. | |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
