Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-0760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of null characters (%00) within FTP URIs by Mozilla. When a null character is present in an FTP URI, Mozilla could be misled into interpreting a resource as a different MIME type than it actually is.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **MIME Type Confusion:** The primary weakness is the ability to manipulate the perceived MIME type of a resource by inserting a null byte in its URI. This could lead to the browser treating the resource as a different file type, such as HTML, when it's not.
-   **Improper Input Validation**: The vulnerability is due to lack of proper input validation in the ftp URI handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Code Execution:** By manipulating the MIME type, an attacker could potentially trick the browser into executing malicious code (e.g., JavaScript) that was not intended to be executed.
-   **Local Zone Code Execution**: Combining this vulnerability with the knowledge of the Firefox cache file locations allowed the attacker to execute code in the local zone, leading to compromise of the victim's computer.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Crafted FTP URIs:** The primary attack vector involves creating malicious FTP URIs that include null characters (%00).
-   **Redirection**: Redirecting a user in the Internet Zone to a crafted file:// location could result in code execution in the local zone.
-   **Malicious Website:** An attacker could host a website designed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Create FTP URIs:** The attacker needs to be able to construct FTP URIs that include a null character (%00).
-   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to persuade the victim to access the malicious URI (either through a link or redirection).

**Additional Details from the Content:**

-   The vulnerability also affects the `file://` protocol by allowing for a file to be loaded as a different MIME type, based on the crafted URI.
-   The provided bug report also details other areas of concern in the handling of URIs such as control characters, `/.`, and `../`.
-   Patches were created to prevent loading of ftp:// URIs and file:// URIs with null bytes and other invalid characters in the path.
-   The bug report notes that IE cuts the URL at the %00 mark, and refuses to recognize the URL.
-   The bug was assigned the CVE ID CAN-2004-0760.
-   The vulnerability was fixed in Mozilla versions 1.4.3, 1.7.2, and 1.7.5.
