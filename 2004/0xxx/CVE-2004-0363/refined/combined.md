Symantec Security Advisory

SYM04-005

19 March, 2004
Symantec Norton Internet Security and Norton AntiSpam Remote Access
Vulnerability

Revision History
None

Risk Impact
High

Overview
NGSsoftware notified Symantec of a security vulnerability NGSsoftware had
found in the Symantec Norton Internet Security and Symantec Norton
AntiSpam 2004. If properly exploited this vulnerability could allow remote
execution of arbitrary code on a targeted system resulting in possible
system compromise.

Affected Components
Symantec Norton Internet Security 2004 and Professional for Windows
Symantec Norton AntiSpam 2004

Details
Symantec was alerted to a remote access vulnerability that NGSsoftware
discovered while evaluating Symantec Norton Internet Security 2004 and
Symantec Norton AntiSpam 2004.  Symantec Norton Internet Security and
Symantec Norton AntiSpam 2004 contain ActiveX components that do not do
proper bounds checking of external input.  A malicious individual could
potentially exploit these weaknesses to launch a local application on the
target system and possibly run arbitrary code of their choice on the local
system with elevated privileges.

To do this successfully, the attacker would need to either entice the
targeted user to visit a location where the malicious code could be
launched or to download and launch the malicious code on their system.
Successful execution of these security issues could result in compromise
of the targeted system.

Symantec Response
Symantec has verified the issues reported by NGSsoftware and released
patches for both Symantec Norton Internet Security and Symantec Norton
AntiSpam 2004 via Symantec LiveUpdate.  Customers should run Symantec
LiveUpdate manually to ensure all installed Symantec products are fully
updated.
·       Open any installed Symantec product
·       Click on LiveUpdate in the toolbar
·       Run LiveUpdate until all available Symantec product updates are
downloaded and installed

Symantec is unaware of any active exploits for or customer impact from
these issues.  Symantec will continue to evaluate the issues.

As a part of normal best practices, Symantec recommends using a
multi-layered approach to security. Users, at a minimum, should run both
personal firewall and antivirus applications with current updates to
provide multiple points of detection and protection to both inbound and
outbound threats.

Users should keep vendor-supplied patches for all application software and
operating systems up-to-date.

Users should further be wary of mysterious attachments and executables
delivered via email and be wary of visiting unknown/untrusted websites.

Do not open attachments or executables from unknown sources. Always err on
the side of caution.

Even if the sender is known, be wary of attachments if the sender does not
fully explain the attachment content in the body of the email. You do not
know the source of the attachment.

If in doubt, contact the sender before opening the attachment. If still in
doubt, delete the attachment without opening it.

CVE
Symantec has requested a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
candidate name for these issues.  We will revise this Advisory upon
receipt.

This is a candidate for inclusion in the CVE list (<http://cve.mitre.org>),
which standardizes names for security problems.

Credit:
Symantec appreciates the cooperation of Mark Litchfield and the
NGSsoftware research team in identifying this issue.

Symantec Product Security Contact:
Symantec takes the security and proper functionality of its products very
seriously.  As founding members in the Organization for Internet Safety,

NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: Norton AntiSpam Remote Buffer Overrun
Systems Affected: Windows XP (not confirmed on 2000)
Severity: High
Vendor URL: <http://www.symantec.com>
Author: Mark Litchfield [ mark@ngssoftware.com ]
Date Vendor Notified:    4th March 2004
Date of Public Advisory: 19th March 2004
Advisory number: #NISR19042004a
Advisory URL: <http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/antispam.txt>

Description
***********

Symantec's Norton AntiSpamT 2004 filters unwanted email out of your inbox.
Working with any POP3 email program, it filters incoming mail on multiple
levels, detecting and flagging unsolicited messages while promptly
delivering valid mail. To make your online time more enjoyable, Norton
AntiSpam also blocks intrusive pop-up and banner ads.
It is worth mentioning here, that Norton AntiSpamT is also packaged within
Norton Internet Security 2004 and Norton Internet Security 2004
Professional.

Details
*******

Installed with Norton AntiSpam is an ActiveX component that is marked safe
for scripting, namely SymSpamHelper Class (c:\program files\common
files\symantec shared\antispam\symspam.dll).
Using the method LaunchCustomRuleWizard with an overly long parameter, an
attacker can cause a stack based overflow allowing the ability to remotley
run arbitrary code on the target.  This can be achieved either by
encouraging the 'victim' to visit a malicious web page or placing a script
within the content of an (html) email.

Fix Information
***************

Shipped with all Symantecs products is the LiveUpdate feature. Open Norton
AntiSpam or Norton Internet Security / Professional and select the
LiveUpdate feature which will retrieve the lastest patch.  Also worth
mentioning is Symantec's quick response to this issue in ensuring their
clients remain protected.
