Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `SymSpamHelper Class` ActiveX control (symspam.dll) that ships with Symantec Norton AntiSpam and Norton Internet Security 2004 products. This ActiveX control is marked as safe for scripting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The `LaunchCustomRuleWizard` method within the ActiveX control does not properly validate the length of an input parameter. This allows an attacker to provide an overly long parameter that overflows a buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
*   **Elevated Privileges:** The code execution could occur with elevated privileges.
*   **System Compromise:** This could result in a full compromise of the targeted system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker can host a malicious web page containing JavaScript that exploits the vulnerability when a user visits the page.
*   **HTML Email:**  An attacker can embed malicious scripts within an HTML formatted email that, when opened, trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to entice the victim to either:
    * Visit a malicious web page controlled by the attacker
    * Open an HTML email containing malicious script that triggers the vulnerable ActiveX control method.
*   No special network access or prior authentication is explicitly needed; exploitation occurs on the victim's machine.
