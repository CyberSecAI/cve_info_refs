Package:             sasl
Vulnerability:       arbitrary code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= sasl-2.1.19-20040920     >= sasl-2.1.20-20041025

OpenPKG 2.1          <= sasl-2.1.18-2.1.0        >= sasl-2.1.18-2.1.1

Affected Releases:   Dependent Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      imapd kolab openldap::with_sasl
                     postfix::with_sasl sendmail::with_sasl
OpenPKG 2.2          imapd kolab openldap::with_sasl

OpenPKG 2.1          imapd kolab openldap::with_sasl
                     postfix::with_sasl sendmail::with_sasl

Description:
  A setuid and setgid application vulnerability was found in the Cyrus
  SASL library [[0]](#0). At application startup, libsasl2 attempts to build a
  list of all available SASL plugins which are available on the system.
  To do so, the library searches for and attempts to load every shared
  library found within the plugin directory. This location can be set
  with the SASL_PATH environment variable.

  In situations where an untrusted local user can affect the environment
  of a privileged process, this behavior could be exploited to run
  arbitrary code with the privileges of a setuid or setgid application.
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the
  identifier CAN-2004-0884 [[1]](#1) to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/openpkg
  rpm -q sasl". If you have the "sasl" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution) and any dependent packages as well [2][[3]](#3).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [4][[5]](#5), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [6][[7]](#7) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[8]](#8), build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [[2]](#2) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [[3]](#3). For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.2, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.2/UPD
  ftp> get sasl-2.1.19-2.2.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig sasl-2.1.19-2.2.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild sasl-2.1.19-2.2.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/sasl-2.1.19-2.2.1.*.rpm

  Additionally, we recommend that you rebuild and reinstall
  any dependent packages (see above) as well [2][[3]](#3).

Package        : cyrus-sasl-mit
Vulnerability  : unsanitised input
Problem-Type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0884
Debian Bug     : 275498

A vulnerability has been discovered in the Cyrus implementation of the
SASL library, the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method
for adding authentication support to connection-based protocols.  The
library honors the environment variable SASL_PATH blindly, which
allows a local user to link against a malicious library to run
arbitrary code with the privileges of a setuid or setgid application.

The MIT version of the Cyrus implementation of the SASL library
provides bindings against MIT GSSAPI and MIT Kerberos4.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.24-15woody3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your libsasl packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=134979#c0)  Benjamin Gordon    2004-10-07 17:16:14 UTC  ``` From Bugzilla Helper: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040914 Firefox/0.10  Description of problem: The cyrus-sasl-2.1.15-9 update from today causes crashes in all authentication processes such as ssh, su, sudo, etc when pam is configured to look up user accounts and passwords in ldap.  Replacing 2.1.15-9 with 2.1.15-8 fixes the problem.  All accounts on the machines are affected, not just accounts stored in ldap.    Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): cyrus-sasl-2.1.15-9  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Upgrade to cyrus-sasl-2.1.15-9 2. Run /bin/su       Actual Results:  su crashes with a segmentation fault  Additional info:  We have our ldap set to use tls to talk to the server.  Removing the ldap lines from /etc/pam.d/system-auth definitely stops the crashes.  I have not tested if just removing the tls part fixes it.  The top 6 stack frames from a core dump of su are: #0  0x002b61e1 in _sasl_getcallback () from /usr/lib/libsasl.so.7 #1  0x002baf46 in _sasl_get_mech_list () from /usr/lib/libsasl.so.7 #2  0x002b976d in sasl_client_new () from /usr/lib/libsasl.so.7 #3  0x00e18891 in ldap_int_sasl_init () from /usr/lib/libldap.so.2 #4  0x00e28b1c in ldap_int_initialize () from /usr/lib/libldap.so.2 #5  0x00e29150 in ldap_set_option () from /usr/lib/libldap.so.2 #6  0x0011b79d in ?? () from /lib/security/pam_ldap.so  Following that are about 550 lines similar to #6.  I can post the full backtrace if needed.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=134979#c2)  Marc Wallman    2004-10-07 18:43:07 UTC  ``` It breaks /usr/bin/ldapsearch too. Anonymous lookups segfault before returning any results.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=134979#c3)  Mark J. Cox    2004-10-07 19:31:12 UTC  ``` Update in progress   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=134979#c4)  Dan Stromberg    2004-10-07 19:35:05 UTC  ``` We had much the same problem, but we aren't using LDAP for anything.  Sendmail, upon being killed and restarted, would segfault until we downgraded to -8 of the cyrus-sasl package.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=134979#c5)  Lee Whatley    2004-10-07 19:39:46 UTC  ``` Yeah we are not using ldap here and sendmail crapped on itself after the cyrus-sasl upgrade.  The queue runner would start, but the actual daemon would not.  It would just segfault like the previoud poster said.  We also had to downgrade to -8 for sendmail to work again.  It hasn't affected anything else but sendmail as far as I can tell...   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=134979#c7)  Mark J. Cox    2004-10-07 20:37:09 UTC  ``` Revised packages are currently undergoing QA   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=134979#c8)  Mark J. Cox    2004-10-07 20:47:20 UTC  ``` (Note this flaw only affects the RHEL 3 cyrus-sasl packages, the RHEL 2.1 packages contained a correct patch)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=134979#c9)  Josh Bressers    2004-10-07 22:03:25 UTC  ```  An errata has been issued which should help the problem  described in this bug report. This report is therefore being  closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files,  please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report  if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2004-546.html>    ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=134979#c10)  Suzanne Hillman    2004-10-12 19:33:59 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 135056](show_bug.cgi?id=135056 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - After bugfix update of cyrus-sasl, openldap and postfix segfault") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=134657#c0)  Josh Bressers    2004-10-05 14:24:02 UTC  ``` Gentoo has reported this issue via vendor-sec on 2004-10-05  Libsasl honors the environment variable SASL_PATH blindly, allowing a local user to compile a "library" locally that is executed with the EID of SASL when anything calls libsasl.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=134657#c1)  Josh Bressers    2004-10-05 14:41:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 104781](attachment.cgi?id=104781&action=diff "Upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=104781&action=edit "Upstream patch") Upstream patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=134657#c2)  Josh Bressers    2004-10-05 18:10:01 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 134658](show_bug.cgi?id=134658 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CAN-2004-0884 privilege escalation") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=134657#c3)  Josh Bressers    2004-10-05 18:12:32 UTC  ``` This issue also affects RHEL2.1   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=134657#c4)  Josh Bressers    2004-10-05 18:30:17 UTC  ``` This issue goes public on 2004-10-07   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=134657#c5)  Mark J. Cox    2004-10-07 13:43:51 UTC  ``` Removing embargo   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=134657#c6)  Josh Bressers    2004-10-07 14:51:42 UTC  ```  An errata has been issued which should help the problem  described in this bug report.

You may reopen this bug report  if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2004-546.html>    ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=134657#c7)  Josh Bressers    2004-10-07 22:03:25 UTC  ```  An errata has been issued which should help the problem  described in this bug report. This report is therefore being  closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files,  please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report  if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2004-546.html>    ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=134657#c8)  Michal Jaegermann    2004-10-12 21:31:37 UTC  ``` It is a bit confusing what is really in [CAN-2004-0884](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-0884), as it is marked now ** RESERVED **, but Gentoo GLSA 200410-05 advisory, <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/377775/2004-10-04/2004-10-10/0> says also "Cyrus-SASL contains a remote buffer overflow in the digestmda5.c file".  See <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/11347> as well.  Somehow I do no see in the recent code patches anything which would address that concern; or this is something new and not mentioned by CAN-2004-0884?    ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=134657#c9)  Mark J. Cox    2004-10-12 21:36:31 UTC  ``` The digestmda5.c issue was separate to [CAN-2004-0884](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-0884) and did not affect any version of cryus-sasl with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (or Fedora Core).   ``` |  |

RHSA-2004:546 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2004-10-07
Updated:
2004-10-07
# RHSA-2004:546 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

cyrus-sasl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated cyrus-sasl packages that fix a setuid and setgid application
vulnerability are now available.

[Updated 7th October 2004]
Revised cryus-sasl packages have been added for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3;
the patch in the previous packages broke interaction with ldap.

## Description

The cyrus-sasl package contains the Cyrus implementation of SASL. SASL is
the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for adding
authentication support to connection-based protocols.

At application startup, libsasl and libsasl2 attempts to build a list
of all available SASL plug-ins which are available on the system. To do
so, the libraries search for and attempt to load every shared library found
within the plug-in directory. This location can be set with the SASL\_PATH
environment variable.

In situations where an untrusted local user can affect the environment of a
privileged process, this behavior could be exploited to run arbitrary code
with the privileges of a setuid or setgid application. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0884 to this issue.

Users of cyrus-sasl should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches and are not vulnerable to this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied. Use Red Hat
Network to download and update your packages. To launch the Red Hat
Update Agent, use the following command:

# Cyrus-SASL: Buffer overflow and SASL\_PATH vulnerabilities — GLSA **200410-05**

Cyrus-SASL contains two vulnerabilities that might allow an attacker to
completely compromise the vulnerable system.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/cyrus-sasl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.1.18-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.1.18-r2** |

### Background

Cyrus-SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and
Security Layer.

### Description

Cyrus-SASL contains a remote buffer overflow in the digestmda5.c file.
Additionally, under certain conditions it is possible for a local user
to exploit a vulnerability in the way the SASL\_PATH environment
variable is honored (CAN-2004-0884).

### Impact

An attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code with the Effective
ID of the application calling the Cyrus-SASL libraries.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Cyrus-SASL users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=dev-libs/cyrus-sasl-2.1.18-r2"
 # emerge ">=dev-libs/cyrus-sasl-2.1.18-r2"
```
