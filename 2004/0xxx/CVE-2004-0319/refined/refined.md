- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ezBoard software fails to properly filter or sanitize user-supplied input within the `[font]` tag, specifically when used with the `background` attribute and `javascript:` URL scheme.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of the victim's browser when they view the forum post. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves crafting a forum post containing a specially crafted `[font]` tag with a `background` attribute that contains malicious javascript within a `javascript:` URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to post content to a vulnerable ezBoard forum.
