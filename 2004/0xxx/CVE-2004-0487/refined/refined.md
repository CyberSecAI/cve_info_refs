- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can trigger the vulnerability from a remote location (e.g., via a malicious website).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Target System:** To execute an arbitrary program, the attacker needs prior knowledge of the executable's location on the victim's system.
- **Ability to Host/Distribute Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be able to host or distribute the malicious HTML that exploits the vulnerability, typically by creating or compromising a web site.
- **Induce User Interaction:** The attacker needs to induce a victim to view the malicious content.
