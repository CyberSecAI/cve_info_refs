## Apple Mac OS X vulnerable to privilege escalation when using Directory Services

#### Vulnerability Note VU#174790

Original Release Date: 2004-06-21 | Last Revised: 2004-07-21

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in Mac OS X may permit a local authenticated user with physical access to the machine to gain elevated privileges.

### Description

| Mac OS X permits the remote authentication of users via directory sevices lookups. When a user logs in to a machine configured to use the Directory Services to provide authentication, it is possible to disconnect the machine's network connection and potentially be logged in with a Finder running as root. This gives the user full root permissions on the machine. Applications started in the session will also run as root.  This vulnerability affects Mac OS X 10.3 through 10.3.3. |

### Impact

### Solution
