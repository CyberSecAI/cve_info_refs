- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from how Mac OS X handles directory service lookups for user authentication. Specifically, it's related to the timing of network disconnection during the login process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the ability to disconnect the network connection of a machine configured to use Directory Services during user authentication which can result in the Finder application running with root privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows a local, authenticated user with physical access to gain full root permissions on the machine. Any applications started within this session will also run as root.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector requires physical access to the machine. It involves logging in as an authenticated user on a system configured to use Directory Services and then disconnecting the network during the authentication process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a local, authenticated user with physical access to the machine. They must also be able to manipulate the network connection.
