Zone-h Security Team has discovered a flaw in BosDates. There is a vulnerability in \
the current version (and also in prior versions) of BosDates that allows an attacker \
to disclose sensitive information that could be used to gain unauthorized access. \
"BosDates is hands-down the MOST feature packed calendar on the market today. The \
BosDates calendar system is the best full featured calendar system on the market \
today at half the price of our competitors!"

Details

The problems exist due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data. A remote \
attacker may exploit this issue to influence SQL query logic to disclose sensitive \
information that could be used to gain unauthorized access.
