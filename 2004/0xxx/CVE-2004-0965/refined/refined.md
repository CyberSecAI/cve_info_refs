- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `stmkfont` program in HP-UX uses relative paths when executing external commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of relative paths by a set-group-ID (`sgid`) executable. When `stmkfont` executes external commands using relative paths, a local attacker can manipulate the `PATH` environment variable to point to a malicious executable of their choosing. 
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the 'bin' group (due to the `sgid` bit), leading to a privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have shell access. The attacker needs to manipulate the `PATH` environment variable before executing `stmkfont`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local shell access to the vulnerable system. They need to be able to set the `PATH` environment variable and execute `stmkfont`.
