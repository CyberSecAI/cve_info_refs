Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation in OpenConnect WebConnect when handling HTTP requests. Specifically, the software fails to check for MS-DOS device names within the requested URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper Input Validation: The software does not validate the URL input, allowing special device names to be processed as part of the request.
- Denial of Service: The software becomes unresponsive after processing an HTTP request containing an MS-DOS device name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A remote attacker can cause the WebConnect service to stop responding, effectively blocking access to the application and all its supported services. This affects all HTTP and emulation services provided by WebConnect.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET or POST requests: The attack is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request (either GET or POST) that includes an MS-DOS device name in the URL.
- Both client website and the administration interface: The vulnerability can be exploited through both the client-facing website and the administrative interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote Access: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network by sending crafted HTTP requests.
- No Authentication Required: It appears no authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability, meaning it can be exploited by unauthenticated users.

**Additional Details:**

- Affected Versions: WebConnect versions 6.4.4 and 6.5 (Windows versions) are vulnerable.
- Corrected Versions: The vulnerability is fixed in WebConnect versions 6.4.5 and 6.5.1.
- The vulnerability only affects the Windows versions of WebConnect.
- The vulnerability is identified as VU#552561 by CERT.
- The vulnerability was reported by Dennis Rand of the Danish Computer Incident Response Team.
