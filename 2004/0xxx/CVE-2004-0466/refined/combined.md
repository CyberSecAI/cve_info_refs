How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The WebConnect 6.4.4 and 6.5 contains several vulnerabilities such as:
 - Denial of Service when requesting an DOS Device in Path Name
 - Reading of files outside webroot (Directory traversal)

Requesting "DOS Device in Path Name" Denial of Service
When requesting a DOS device in the URL the server will stop responding
to any further requests before a manual restart of service has been made.
This attack can be preformed on both the client website and the
administration interface.

Vulnerable versions:
 - WebConnect 6.4.4 (Possible previous versions)
 - WebConnect 6.5

CERT response:
 - VU#552561 CAN-2004-0466

Reading of files outside webroot (Directory traversal)
When sending a specially crafted request to the server it is possible to
read files outside the webroot. Since the service as default runs with
system rights, this could give access to the entire partition that
WebConnect
are installed on.

Vulnerable versions:
 - WebConnect 6.4.4 (Possible previous versions)

CERT response:
 - VU#628411 CAN-2004-0465

## OpenConnect Webconnect MS-DOS device name denial-of-service

#### Vulnerability Note VU#552561

Original Release Date: 2005-02-21 | Last Revised: 2005-02-21

---

### Overview

OpenConnect WebConnect may stop responding after processing an HTTP request with an MS-DOS device name in it.

### Description

| OpenConnect Webconnect provides secured web access and emulation services for backend mainframes and UNIX servers. Versions of Webconnect prior to 6.4.5 and 6.5.1 running on Windows OS may stop responding after processing an HTTP GET or POST request with an MS-DOS device name in it. All HTTP and emulation services supported by Webconnect may be affected after such an attack. |
| --- |

### Impact

| OpenConnect WebConnect running on Windows OS may experience a denial-of-service condition after processing MS-DOS device names in HTTP requests. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Affected sites should upgrade to a corrected version of WebConnect, versions 6.4.5 and 6.5.1. Licensed users can send mail to OpenConnect technical support mailto: ocs\_support@oc.com, or call +1-972-888-0678. |

### Vendor Statement

**Vulnerability Note VU#552561**

**OpenConnect WebConnect MS-DOS Device Name Denial of Service**

**Overview**

When requesting a DOS device name in the URL, the server may stop responding to any further requests.

**I. Description**

From the OpenConnect webpage:

WebConnect is client-server based software that provides secure browser based emulation to mainframe, midrange and UNIX systems. WebConnect enables enterprise organizations to provide suppliers, partners and employees with secure access to vital applications and information. Enterprises increase productivity and profits, and retain all the advantages of secure host connectivity to new and existing applications in "real-time."

Because WebConnect is non-intrusive, it provides secure SSL encrypted information migration and access without requiring modification to the host. With its patented secure, "persistent connectivity" technology, only WebConnect is capable of supporting tens of thousands of concurrent browser-based users.

WebConnect 6.4.4 and 6.5 do not check for DOS device names within requested URLs. This may allow a denial of service attack by requesting a DOS device name. This affects only the Windows versions of WebConnect. This can affect all http services provided by WebConnect.

**II. Impact**

Remote attackers could block access to WebConnect by causing the service to become unresponsive.

**III. Solution**

**Update to a corrected version of WebConnect**

This vulnerability has been corrected in WebConnect versions 6.4.5 and 6.5.1. Licensed users of WebConnect may contact OpenConnect Technical Support to receive these updated versions.

**Credit**

Thanks to Dennis Rand of the Danish Computer Incident Response Team for reporting this vulnerability.

### Vendor Statement

**Vulnerability Note VU#552561**

**OpenConnect WebConnect MS-DOS Device Name Denial of Service**

**Overview**

When requesting a DOS device name in the URL, the server may stop responding to any further requests.

**I. Description**

From the OpenConnect webpage:

WebConnect is client-server based software that provides secure browser based emulation to mainframe, midrange and UNIX systems. WebConnect enables enterprise organizations to provide suppliers, partners and employees with secure access to vital applications and information. Enterprises increase productivity and profits, and retain all the advantages of secure host connectivity to new and existing applications in "real-time."

Because WebConnect is non-intrusive, it provides secure SSL encrypted information migration and access without requiring modification to the host. With its patented secure, "persistent connectivity" technology, only WebConnect is capable of supporting tens of thousands of concurrent browser-based users.

WebConnect 6.4.4 and 6.5 do not check for DOS device names within requested URLs. This may allow a denial of service attack by requesting a DOS device name. This affects only the Windows versions of WebConnect. This can affect all http services provided by WebConnect.

**II. Impact**

Remote attackers could block access to WebConnect by causing the service to become unresponsive.

**III. Solution**

**Update to a corrected version of WebConnect**

This vulnerability has been corrected in WebConnect versions 6.4.5 and 6.5.1. Licensed users of WebConnect may contact OpenConnect Technical Support to receive these updated versions.
