The provided content describes a crash in Internet Explorer related to loading CSS styles within a table.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is an issue in how Internet Explorer (specifically mshtml.dll) handles CSS styles when loaded within a table. This leads to an access violation. The exact trigger is likely related to the specific CSS and HTML structure in the provided link.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is an access violation, specifically a null pointer dereference when attempting to access memory at address pointed to by ECX, which is null (EAX = 0 after dereference).

**Impact of exploitation:** The impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, as it crashes Internet Explorer and all other instances of the browser that are open.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTML page that includes a table and associated CSS. The attacker would host this page on a web server and convince the victim to visit it using Internet Explorer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to host a web page and to lure the victim into viewing the malicious page using Internet Explorer 6.
