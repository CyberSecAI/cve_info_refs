Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.4.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

* **001: DOCUMENTATION FIX: November 1, 2003**
    *All architectures*

  The CD insert documentation has an incorrect example for package installation.

  Where it is written:

  **# pkg\_add https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/3.4/packages/i386**

  It should instead read:

  **# pkg\_add https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/3.4/packages/i386/**

  The extra **/** at the end is important. We do not make
  patch files available for things printed on paper.

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: November 1, 2003**
      *All architectures*

    The use of certain ASN.1 encodings or malformed public keys may allow an
    attacker to mount a denial of service attack against applications linked with
    [ssl(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/ssl.3).
    This does not affect OpenSSH.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.4/common/002_asn1.patch)

    * **003: RELIABILITY FIX: November 1, 2003**
        *All architectures*

      It is possible for a local user to cause a system panic by flooding it with spoofed ARP
      requests.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.4/common/003_arp.patch)

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: November 1, 2003**
          *All architectures*

        A user with write permission to `httpd.conf` or a `.htaccess`
        file can crash
        [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/httpd.8)
        or potentially run arbitrary code as the user `www` (although it
        is believed that ProPolice will prevent code execution).

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.4/common/004_httpd.patch)

        * **005: RELIABILITY FIX: November 4, 2003**
            *All architectures*

          It is possible for a local user to cause a system panic by executing a specially crafted binary with an invalid header.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.4/common/005_exec.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: November 17, 2003**
              *i386 only*

            It may be possible for a local user to overrun the stack in
            [compat\_ibcs2(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/compat_ibcs2.8).

            ProPolice catches this, turning a potential privilege escalation into a denial
            of service. iBCS2 emulation does not need to be enabled via
            [sysctl(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/sysctl.8)
            for this to happen.

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.4/i386/006_ibcs2.patch)

            * **007: RELIABILITY FIX: November 20, 2003**
                *All architectures*

              It is possible for a local user to cause a crash via
              [sysctl(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/sysctl.3) with certain arguments.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.4/common/007_uvm.patch)

              * **008: RELIABILITY FIX: November 20, 2003**
                  *All architectures*

                An improper bounds check makes it possible for a local user to cause a crash
                by passing the
                [semctl(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/semctl.2) and
                [semop(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/semop.2) functions
                certain arguments.

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.4/common/008_sem.patch)

                * **009: SECURITY FIX: January 13, 2004**
                    *All architectures*

                  Several message handling flaws in
                  [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/isakmpd.8)
                  have been reported by Thomas Walpuski. These allow an attacker to delete arbitrary SAs. The patch also
                  includes a reliability fix for a filedescriptor leak that causes problems when a crypto card is
                  installed.

                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.4/common/009_isakmpd.patch)

                  * **010: SECURITY FIX: February 5, 2004**
                      *All architectures*

                    A reference counting bug exists in the
                    [shmat(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/shmat.2)
                    system call that could be used by an attacker to write to kernel memory
                    under certain circumstances.

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.4/common/010_sysvshm.patch)

                    * **011: SECURITY FIX: February 8, 2004**
                        *All architectures*

                      An IPv6 MTU handling problem exists that could be used by an attacker
                      to cause a denial of service attack against hosts with reachable IPv6
                      TCP ports.

                      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.4/common/011_ip6.patch)

                      * **012: RELIABILITY FIX: February 14, 2004**
                          *All architectures*

                        Several buffer overflows exist in the code parsing
                        font.aliases files in XFree86. Thanks to ProPolice, these cannot be
                        exploited to gain privileges, but they can cause the X server to abort.

                        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.4/common/012_font.patch)

                        * **013: RELIABILITY FIX: March 8, 2004**
                            *All architectures*

                          OpenBSD's TCP/IP stack did not impose limits on how many out-of-order
                          TCP segments are queued in the system. An attacker could
                          send out-of-order TCP segments and trick the system into using all
                          available memory buffers.

                          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.4/common/013_tcp.patch)

                          * **014: SECURITY FIX: March 13, 2004**
                              *All architectures*

                            Due to a bug in the parsing of Allow/Deny rules for
                            [httpd(8)'s](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/httpd.8)
                            access module, using IP addresses without a netmask on big endian 64-bit
                            platforms causes the rules to fail to match. This only affects sparc64.

                            * **015: RELIABILITY FIX: March 17, 2004**
                                *All architectures*

                              Defects in the payload validation and processing functions of
                              [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/isakmpd.8)
                              have been discovered. An attacker could send malformed ISAKMP messages and
                              cause isakmpd to crash or to loop endlessly. This patch fixes these problems
                              and removes some memory leaks.

                              * **016: RELIABILITY FIX: March 17, 2004**
                                  *All architectures*

                                A missing check for a NULL-pointer dereference has been found in
                                [ssl(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/ssl.3).
                                A remote attacker can use the bug to cause an OpenSSL application to crash;
                                this may lead to a denial of service.

                                  malicious servers to overwrite files outside the local CVS tree on

                                            has established a cross-realm trust with their realm. The flaw is due to
