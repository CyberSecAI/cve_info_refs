{
  "CVE-2004-0551": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in how Cisco CatOS handles malformed TCP connection attempts.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of TCP connections",
      "Invalid TCP state transitions"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS), leading to device malfunction and reload.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack is conducted remotely through a spoofed source, targeting externally-facing TCP services such as Telnet, SSH, or HTTP.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send malformed TCP packets, specifically by not completing the TCP handshake with the final ACK, and instead sending an invalid response to move the connection to an invalid TCP state."
