Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2004-0905:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how Mozilla browsers handle dragged `javascript:` links. Specifically, when a user drags a `javascript:` link from one window or frame to another, the script within that link executes in the security context of the *destination* window or frame, rather than its origin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-domain scripting violation:** The vulnerability allows a script from one domain to gain access to and manipulate data in a different domain, violating the same-origin policy.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** By dragging specially crafted `javascript:` links, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code. This is further exacerbated when combined with another vulnerability (Bug 250725) where drag-and-dropped links skip the normal URL checking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information theft:** An attacker could steal sensitive information from a user's session on a targeted website.
*   **Data modification:** Malicious scripts could modify data within the targeted domain.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If combined with other vulnerabilities, such as the one fixed in Bug 250725, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
*   **Spoofing:** As the code execution happens within the context of the target window/frame, attackers can make a malicious page appear to be a legitimate one.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Drag and Drop:** The attack vector is through the user dragging a `javascript:` link from a malicious source to a vulnerable target frame or window.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers rely on social engineering to trick users into dragging the malicious link. This could involve disguising the malicious link or embedding it in an otherwise harmless-looking interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create malicious links:** The attacker must be able to create a webpage with a javascript: link.
*   **User interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the user into dragging the malicious link to a target window or frame.
*   **No elevated privileges needed:** The attacker does not require any elevated privileges to carry out this attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple Mozilla-based browsers.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Firefox Preview Release, Mozilla 1.7.3, and Thunderbird 0.8.
*   The issue also affects `data:` URLs, as they also inherit the security context of the previous page.

In summary, CVE-2004-0905 describes a critical cross-domain scripting vulnerability in Mozilla browsers arising from the mishandling of dragged `javascript:` links. This could lead to information theft, data modification, and potentially arbitrary code execution if combined with other issues. Successful exploitation requires tricking a user into dragging a malicious javascript link.
