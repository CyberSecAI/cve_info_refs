# OpenSSL, Groff: Insecure tempfile handling — GLSA **200411-15**

groffer, included in the Groff package, and the der\_chop script, included
in the OpenSSL package, are both vulnerable to symlink attacks, potentially
allowing a local user to overwrite arbitrary files with the rights of the
user running the utility.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.7d-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.7d-r2** |

| Package | **sys-apps/groff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.19.1-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.19.1-r2**revision >= **1.18.1.1** |

### Background

OpenSSL is a toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer and
Transport Layer Security protocols as well as a general-purpose
cryptography library. It includes the der\_chop script, which is used to
convert DER-encoded certificates to PEM format. Groff (GNU Troff) is a
typesetting package which reads plain text mixed with formatting
commands and produces formatted output. It includes groffer, a command
used to display groff files and man pages on X and tty.

### Description

groffer and the der\_chop script create temporary files in
world-writeable directories with predictable names.

### Impact

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary files
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
groffer or der\_chop is executed, this would result in the file being
overwritten with the rights of the user running the utility, which
could be the root user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Groff users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose sys-apps/groff
```

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.7d-r2"
```

Note: /etc/ssl/misc/der\_chop is protected by Portage as a configuration
file. Don't forget to use etc-update and overwrite the old version with
the new one.

<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
December 1st, 2004                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : openssl
Vulnerability  : insecure temporary file
Problem-Type   : local/remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0975

Trustix developers discovered insecure temporary file creation in a
supplemental script (der_chop) of the openssl package which may allow
local users to overwrite files via a symlink attack.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6c-2.woody.7.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.7e-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=136302#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2004-10-19 09:46:55 UTC  ``` On September 10th 2004, Trustix shared some temporary file vulnerabilities with vendor-sec.  After some refinement these were made public on Sep30.  These are minor issues (impact: LOW) and therefore should be fixed in future updates, but don't deserve their own security advisory.  Temporary file vulnerability in der_chop script.  Patch attached.  However der_chop isn't a useful script and is deprecated.  Removing der_chop script is a valid solution to this issue.                  Affects: RHEL3                 Affects: RHEL2.1   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=136302#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2004-10-19 09:48:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 105431](attachment.cgi?id=105431&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=105431&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=136302#c2)  Mark J. Cox    2004-12-07 10:46:46 UTC  ``` Will be RHSA-2004:652   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=136302#c6)  Josh Bressers    2005-06-01 13:32:43 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2005-476.html>    ``` |  |
