## Apple Quicktime/Darwin Streaming Server fails to properly parse DESCRIBE requests

#### Vulnerability Note VU#460350

Original Release Date: 2004-02-25 | Last Revised: 2004-03-15

---

### Overview

Apple Quicktime/Darwin Streaming Server fails to properly parse DESCRIBE requests containing overly large User-Agent fields. This could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| Apple's QuickTime and Darwin Streaming Server is software which provides integrated distribution of various forms of digital content. Such content can be delivered over a network using Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) and Real-Time Streaming Protocol ([RTSP](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2326.txt)).  The RTSP provides a DESCRIBE method which according to [RFC 2326](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2326.txt) "retrieves the description of a presentation or media object identified by the request URL from a server. It may use the Accept header to specify the description formats that the client understands. The server responds with a description of the requested resource. The DESCRIBE reply-response pair constitutes the media initialization phase of RTSP."There is a vulnerability in the way the Quicktime/Darwin Streaming Server parses DESCRIBE requests containing specially crafted User-Agent fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a DESCRIBE request containing an overly large User-Agent field. |
