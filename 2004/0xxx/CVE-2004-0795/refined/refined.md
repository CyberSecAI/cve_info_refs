Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper privilege handling in the IBM DB2 Remote Command Server (DB2RCMD.EXE). When a client connects to the DB2REMOTECMD named pipe, the server spawns a new process (db2rcmdc.exe) to execute the received command. This spawned process runs with the privileges of the "db2admin" account, which is an administrator, regardless of the privileges of the connecting user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user (even a "Guest" account) can execute commands with administrative privileges.
*   **Insecure Command Execution:**  The Remote Command Server does not properly validate the privileges of the connecting user before executing commands with elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** Attackers can gain full control of the server running DB2 due to the ability to execute arbitrary commands as an administrator.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive database information.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can disrupt the availability of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack:** Attackers can connect remotely to the DB2REMOTECMD named pipe.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker must be able to establish a connection to the DB2 server's named pipe (DB2REMOTECMD).
*   **Valid Windows credentials:** The attacker needs a valid Windows user ID and password, but it can be a low-privileged account such as a guest account.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects DB2 8.1 Enterprise Edition on Windows.
*   IBM has released a fix in Fixpak 5. The APAR for the issue is IY53894.
*   The advisory was published by NGSSoftware Insight Security Research.
