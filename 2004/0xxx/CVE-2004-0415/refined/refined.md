  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2004-0415",
      "root_cause": "Invalid 32 to 64 bit conversions in the kernel, and insecure direct access to file offset pointers in kernel code.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Improper conversion between 32-bit and 64-bit data types",
        "Insecure direct access to file offset pointers"
      ],
      "impact": "A local, unprivileged attacker can access segments of kernel memory or environment variables which may contain sensitive information. This information may include passwords, data transferred between processes, and any memory not cleared by applications upon exit, as well as kernel cache and buffers. This can lead to further exploitation or denial of service if the attacker gains superuser access.",

      "attacker_capabilities": "Local unprivileged access to the system is sufficient."

       "cve_id": "CVE-2004-0685",
      "root_cause": "Certain USB drivers use uninitialized structures, which are then copied to user space using the `copy_to_user()` kernel call.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of uninitialized data structures",
        "Information leak through `copy_to_user()`"

      "impact": "A local, unprivileged attacker can leak uninitialized kernel memory which may contain sensitive information from user applications. This information can be used to further exploit the system.",

          "Information leak through `/proc` interface"
