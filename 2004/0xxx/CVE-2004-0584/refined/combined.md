# Horde-IMP: Input validation vulnerability — GLSA **200406-11**

An input validation vulnerability has been discovered in Horde-IMP.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/horde-imp** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **3.2.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.2.4** |

### Background

Horde-IMP is the Internet Messaging Program. It is written in PHP and
provides webmail access to IMAP and POP3 accounts.

### Description

Horde-IMP fails to properly sanitize email messages that contain
malicious HTML or script code.

### Impact

By enticing a user to read a specially crafted e-mail, an attacker can
execute arbitrary scripts running in the context of the victim's
browser. This could lead to a compromise of the user's webmail account,
cookie theft, etc.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Horde-IMP users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=www-apps/horde-imp-3.2.4"
 # emerge ">=www-apps/horde-imp-3.2.4"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Lance Albertson (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-13 23:37:43 UTC  ``` Excerpt from my SANS email:  04.23.34 CVE: Not Available Platform: Web Application Title: Horde IMP Input Validation Vulnerability Description: Horde IMP is a web-based IMAP email interface written in PHP. Insufficient sanitization of email messages that contain malicious HTML or script code expose an arbitrary HTML injection and script execution issue. All current releases in the 3.x branch are affected. Ref: <http://www.horde.org/imp/3.2/>  I don't see anything specific on their site about what exactly causes this (might be in the Changlog when you download it). Version 3.2.4 is in portage, but marked ~arch on all arch's. [Bug #53400](show_bug.cgi?id=53400 "RESOLVED FIXED - net-www/horde-imp version 3.2.4 released.") was the initial bug for getting it into portage, but no mention of the security fix. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2004-06-14 04:58:54 UTC  ``` moved 3.2.4 to stable and removed 3.2.3 ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-15 11:43:04 UTC  ``` GLSA drafted. Security please review.  Bugtraq announcement can be found here:  <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/10501/>  Note: bug number 53862 does not appear in the ChangeLog ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-16 06:31:27 UTC  ``` glsa 200406-11 ``` |  |

IMP is the Internet Messaging Program. It is written in [PHP](http://www.php.net/) and provides webmail access to IMAP
and POP3 accounts. It uses the best-of-class
[Horde/Imap\_Client](http://dev.horde.org/imap_client/) library to
provide fast, robust connections to the remote IMAP/POP3 server. IMP provides
multiple view types to support all possible browsers (desktop vs. mobile vs.
tablet vs. text only).

IMP passes both the
