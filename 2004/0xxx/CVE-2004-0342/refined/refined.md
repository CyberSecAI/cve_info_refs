  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient bounds checking on FTP command buffer and stack overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The FTP command buffer has a default size of 512 bytes. The server increases the buffer by 512 bytes each time it needs more space for the command received from client.",
        "The server doesn't correctly validate if the received data contains the \\n (0x0A) character leading to uncontrolled memory allocation.",
		"Stack-based buffer overflow when creating directory, user option XeroxDocutech is set to 1."
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service. The server can allocate arbitrary amounts of memory, leading to a crash of the server. In some cases, the server process uses 100% CPU. A stack overflow can also lead to denial of service and code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a large FTP command string without \\n (0x0A) byte.",
		"Sending a small FTP packets continuously without \\n (0x0A) or 0x00 byte",
		"Sending MKD or XMKD command with long argument to cause a stack overflow."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "A remote attacker can connect to the FTP server and send crafted commands to exploit these vulnerabilities."
