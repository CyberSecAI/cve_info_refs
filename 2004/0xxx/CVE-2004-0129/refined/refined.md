Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2004-0129:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `export.php` script of phpMyAdmin. It occurs because the script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `what` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal issue. The unsanitized `what` parameter, used within an `include()` function call, allows an attacker to navigate through the server's directory structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this flaw to read arbitrary files on the server with the privileges of the webserver user. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP request to the vulnerable `export.php` script. By manipulating the `what` parameter with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), the attacker can specify files outside of the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable phpMyAdmin instance. No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Basic Understanding:** Basic understanding of web requests and directory traversal techniques is required.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the following code snippet of `export.php`:
  ```php
  if ($what == 'excel') {
      $type = 'csv';
  } else {
      $type = $what;
  }
  require('./libraries/export/' . $type . '.php');
  ```
- By setting the `what` parameter to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`), an attacker can force the `require()` statement to include an arbitrary file, effectively revealing its contents if readable by the webserver.
- The vulnerability is present even if `register_globals` is turned off.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided documents state that phpMyAdmin versions 2.5.5-pl1 and prior are vulnerable.
- A fix for this vulnerability was released in phpMyAdmin version 2.5.6-rc1.
- Patches for `export.php` are also available.
- The vulnerability is classified as "HIGH" severity.
