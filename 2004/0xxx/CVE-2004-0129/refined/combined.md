How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## [phpMyAdmin 5.2.0 is released](/news/2022/5/10/phpmyadmin-520-released/)

2022-05-10

Welcome to the release of phpMyAdmin version 5.2.0. This release contains many new features and quite a few bug fixes. We are simultaneously releasing phpMyAdmin 5.1.4, which is the last release of the 5.1 line and is mostly intended to help downstream packaging teams. Most users should migrate to 5.2.0.

Most notably, these releases resolve a networking error when exporting a file (<https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/17445>).

Some other highlights of 5.2.0 include:

* Removed support for Microsoft Internet Explorer
* Requires PHP 7.2 or newer
* Requires the openssl PHP extension
* Improved handling of system CA bundle and cacert.pem, falling back to Mozilla CA if needed
* Replace "master/slave" terms with "primary/replica"
* Add "NOT LIKE %...%" operator to Table search
* Add support for the Mroonga engine
* Add support for account locking
* Several fixes and improvements to the SQL parser library

## [phpMyAdmin 4.9.10 and 5.1.3 are released](/news/2022/2/11/phpmyadmin-4910-and-513-are-released/)

2022-02-11

The phpMyAdmin team announces the release of versions 4.9.10 and 5.1.3.

These versions primarily address a regression that caused the navigation pane to not function correctly when multiple pages of tables were shown.

Version 5.1.3 includes a security hardening improvement. The issue, reported by Rafael Pedrero, could allow users to cause an error that would reveal the path on disk where phpMyAdmin is running from.
We believe this requires the server to be running with display\_errors on, which is not the recommended setting for a production environment.

Version 5.1.3 includes a few other minor bug fixes and is recommended for all users.

Note that version 4.9 is in extended security support only. Version 5.2.0 is in final testing and is expected to replace the 5.1 branch in the coming week or weeks, with no changes to required versions of PHP or database server.

For the phpMyAdmin team,
Isaac

## [phpMyAdmin 4.9.9 is released](/news/2022/1/23/phpmyadmin-499-released/)

2022-01-23

Welcome to the release of phpMyAdmin version 4.9.9. This is a release to fix two issues with the 4.9.8 release. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Fixed since phpMyAdmin 4.9.8:

* Fix a syntax error preventing use with PHP 5
* An error was shown regarding the new "hide\_configuration\_errors" directive when a controluser is set

Fixed in phpMyAdmin 4.9.8:

* Fix for a user potentially being able to disable their two factor authentication (PMASA-2022-1)
* Add a new configuration directive $cfg['URLQueryEncryption'] to allow encrypting sensitive information in the URL to prevent disclosure. Thanks to Rich Grimes <https://twitter.com/saltycoder> for suggesting this improvement
* Add a new configuration directive $cfg['Servers'][$i]['hide\_connection\_errors'] to allow hiding the full error message when a log on attempt fails, which can leak hostnames or IP addresses of the target database server. Thanks to Dr. Shuzhe Yang, Manager Security Governance at GLS IT Services for suggesting this improvement

Note that the 5.1.2 has two known issues, the hide\_connection\_errors and an issue with the navigation pane. We are preparing fixes for those and will release version 5.1.3 separately.

This is a reminder that phpMyAdmin 4.9 is in the long-term support phase where it will only get important security fixes and critical bug fixes. Users are suggested to migrate to version 5.1.

## [phpMyAdmin 4.9.8, 5.1.2, and 5.2.0-rc1 are released](/news/2022/1/22/phpmyadmin-498-512-and-520-rc1-are-released/)

2022-01-22

The phpMyAdmin project announces several new releases:

* 4.9.8, which fixes some security flaws
* 5.1.2, which fixes some security flaws and contains many bug fixes including better PHP 8.0 and 8.1 compatibility
* 5.2.0-rc1, a testing version introducing many new features

## Security fixes (affected versions as noted)

A flaw was identified in how phpMyAdmin processes two factor authentication; a user could potentially manipulate their account to bypass two factor authentication in subsequent authentication sessions (PMASA-2022-1) (affects both 4.9 and 5.1).

A series of weaknesses was identified allowing a malicious user to submit malicious information to present an XSS or HTML injection attack in the graphical setup page (PMASA-2022-2) (affects 5.1 only; not 4.9).

In some scenarios, potentially sensitive information such as a the database name can be part of the URL. This can now be optionally encrypted. There are two new configuration directives relating to this improvement: `$cfg['URLQueryEncryption']` and `$cfg['URLQueryEncryptionSecretKey']`. This encryption can be enabled by setting URLQueryEncryption to true in your `config.inc.php`. Thanks to Rich Grimes <https://twitter.com/saltycoder> for suggesting this improvement (affects both 4.9 and 5.1).

During a failed log on attempt, the error message reveals the target database server's hostname or IP address. This can reveal some information about the network infrastructure to an attacker. This information can now be suppressed through the `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['hide_connection_errors']` directive. Thanks to Dr. Shuzhe Yang, Manager Security Governance at GLS IT Services for suggesting this improvement (affects both 4.9 and 5.1).

## Bug fixes (5.1.2 and 5.2.0-rc1)

* Revert a changed to $cfg['CharTextareaRows'] allow values less than 7
* Fix encoding of enum and set values on edit value
* Fixed possible "Undefined index: clause\_is\_unique" error
* Fixed some situations where a user is logged out when working with more than one server
* Fixed a problem with assigning privileges to a user using the multiselect list when the database name has an underscore
* Enable cookie parameter "SameSite" when the PHP version is 7.3 or newer
* Correctly handle the removal of "innodb\_file\_format" in MariaDB and MySQL

## New features (5.2.0-rc1)

* Removed support for Microsoft Internet Explorer
* Requires PHP 7.2 or newer
* Requires the openssl PHP extension
* Improved handling of system CA bundle and cacert.pem, falling back to Mozilla CA if needed
* Replace "master/slave" terms with "primary/replica"
* Add "NOT LIKE %...%" operator to Table search
* Add support for the Mroonga engine
* Add support for account locking
* Several fixes and improvements to the SQL parser library

# phpMyAdmin < 2.5.6-rc1: possible attack against export.php — GLSA **200402-05**

A vulnerability in phpMyAdmin which was not properly verifying user
generated input could lead to a directory traversal attack.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/phpmyadmin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.5.5\_p1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5.6\_rc1** |

### Background

phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the administration
of MySQL databased over the Web.

### Description

One component of the phpMyAdmin software package (export.php) does not
properly verify input that is passed to it from a remote user. Since the
input is used to include other files, it is possible to launch a directory
traversal attack.

### Impact

Private information could be gleaned from the remote server if an attacker
uses a malformed URL such as http://phpmyadmin.example.com/export.php?what=../../../[existing\_file]

In this scenario, the script does not sanitize the "what" argument passed
to it, allowing directory traversal attacks to take place, disclosing
the contents of files if the file is readable as the web-server user.

### Workaround

The workaround is to either patch the export.php file using the
referenced CVS patch or upgrade the software via Portage.

### Resolution

Users are encouraged to upgrade to phpMyAdmin-2.5.6\_rc1:

```
 # emerge sync
 # emerge -pv ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.5.6_rc1"
 # emerge ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.5.6_rc1"
 # emerge clean
```
