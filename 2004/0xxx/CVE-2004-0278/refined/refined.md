- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the way the Ratbag game engine handles data blocks received over TCP sockets. The server reads a 16-bit value at the beginning of each data block to determine the expected length of the data. If the server receives less data than indicated by this length value, it enters an infinite loop checking the socket for more data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper error handling when the received data length doesn't match the expected length. The non-blocking socket implementation leads to a busy-wait condition, causing the CPU to spike to 100% usage.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the server. The server becomes unresponsive due to the infinite loop, effectively freezing the match.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote and involves sending a malformed data block with an incorrect length value to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the game server and send manipulated data packets. The attacker is essentially a client communicating with the vulnerable server.
