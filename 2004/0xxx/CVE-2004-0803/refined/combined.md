CESA-2004-006 - rev 5
[See all my vulnerabilities at http://scary.beasts.org/security]
libtiff-3.6.1 image decoder parsing flaws
=========================================
Programs: libtiff, and users of libtiff such as GNOME and KDE
(konqueror and mail clients are of particular concern).
Severity: Compromise of account used to browse malicious TIFF file.
CAN identifier(s): CAN-2004-0803
This advisory lists code flaws discovered by inspection of the libtiff code.
Specifically, libtiff-3.6.1 was investigated. Unfortunately, due to the size
of libtiff, only a limited scan for flaws was possible. These flaws are
likely to typify others present.
Very brief libtiff summary: libtiff is an encoder / decoder for the TIFF image
format. The TIFF image format is an incredibly rich format featuring multiple
possible encodings and formats. The encodings include JPEG, LZW, ZIP, log-based
encodings and many more - from many different companies such as NeXT, SGI and
Pixar.
Flaw 1. Heap-based overflow during RLE decoding in tif\_next.c
off = (bp[0] \* 256) + bp[1];
n = (bp[2] \* 256) + bp[3];
if (cc < 4+n)
goto bad;
\_TIFFmemcpy(row+off, bp+4, n);
Here, off and n are arbitrary values from the TIFF. Bounds checking is
performed on the data source buffer, but not the data destination buffer.
Demo TIFF: http://scary.beasts.org/misc/bad\_next.tiff
(note that memory is subtly corrupted but may not result in an immediate
crash)
Flaw 2. Heap-based overflow during RLE decoding in tif\_thunder.c
case THUNDER\_RUN: /\* pixel run \*/
/\*
\* Replicate the last pixel n times,
\* where n is the lower-order 6 bits.
\*/
if (npixels & 1) {
op[0] |= lastpixel;
lastpixel = \*op++; npixels++; n--;
} else
lastpixel |= lastpixel << 4;
npixels += n;
for (; n > 0; n -= 2)
\*op++ = (tidataval\_t) lastpixel;
Here, n is an arbitrary value from the TIFF, and is used to drive a copy count
into the output without bounds checking.
Demo TIFF: http://scary.beasts.org/misc/bad\_thunder.tiff
(note that memory is subtly corrupted but may not result in an immediate
crash)
Flaw 3. Possible overflow in tif\_luv.c
A TIFF file to confirm this has not been crafted - but it appears that there
may be heap-based overflows when doing RLE decoding:
for (shft = 2\*8; (shft -= 8) >= 0; ) {
for (i = 0; i < npixels && cc > 0; )
if (\*bp >= 128) { /\* run \*/
rc = \*bp++ + (2-128);
b = (int16)(\*bp++ << shft);
cc -= 2;
while (rc--)
[\*] tp[i++] |= b;
} else { /\* non-run \*/
rc = \*bp++; /\* nul is noop \*/
while (--cc && rc--)
[\*] tp[i++] |= (int16)\*bp++ << shft;
Lines marked with a [\*] exhibit a suspicious lack of checking on the size of
the output buffer. Note that tif\_luv.c contains multiple versions of the RLE
decoder for different image depths, and all look similarly dangerous.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
October 15th, 2004                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : tiff
Vulnerability  : heap overflows
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0803 CAN-2004-0804 CAN-2004-0886

Several problems have been discovered in libtiff, the Tag Image File
Format library for processing TIFF graphics files.  An attacker could
prepare a specially crafted TIFF graphic that would cause the client
to execute arbitrary code or crash.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures Project has identified the following problems:

CAN-2004-0803

    Chris Evans discovered several problems in the RLE (run length
    encoding) decoders that could lead to arbitrary code execution.

CAN-2004-0804

    Matthias Clasen discovered a division by zero through an integer
    overflow.

CAN-2004-0886

    Dmitry V. Levin discovered several integer overflows that caused
    malloc issues which can result to either plain crash or memory
    corruption.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.5-6woody1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.1-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libtiff package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

### Description

| LibTIFF is a library used to encode and decode images in [Tag Image File Format (TIFF)](http://www.libtiff.org/). Multiple LibTIFF routines contain buffer overflow vulnerabilities including, but not necessarily limited to, the following functions:     + NeXTDecode (in libtiff/tif\_next.c) + ThunderDecode (in libtiff/tif\_thunder.c) + LogL16Decode (in libtiff/tif\_luv.c)  These issues are the result of insufficient validation of user-supplied data. Consequently, a remote attacker may be able to exploit these vulnerabilities by supplying an application using LibTIFF with a specially crafted TIFF image.Any program that uses the LibTIFF library may be affected by this issue. Users are encouraged to contact their vendors to determine if they are vulnerable. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Specific impacts depend on the application and LibTIFF routine being attacked. Potential consequences range from abrupt and abnormal program termination to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the compromised program. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch** Patch or upgrade as specified by your vendor. Users who suspect they are vulnerable are encouraged to check with their vendor to determine the appropriate action to take. |

KDE Security Advisory: kfax libtiff vulnerabilities
Original Release Date: 2004-12-09
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20041209-2.txt
0. References
CAN-2004-0803
CAN-2004-0804
CAN-2004-0886
1. Systems affected:
All KDE releases earlier than KDE 3.3.2.
2. Overview:
Chris Evans and others discovered multiple vulnerabilities
in the libtiff library. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project assigned CAN-2004-0803 to this issue.
kfax, a small utility for displaying fax files, contains
for historic reasons a private copy of libtiff. Therefore
it is vulnerable to these issues as well.
kfax and the kfax KPart are invoked by KMail or Konqueror
for viewing .g3 files.
For the active KDE maintenance branches, which are
KDE 3.2.x and KDE 3.3.x, this problem has been solved by
removing the private copy of libtiff. In KDE 3.2.x, kfax
will use the tiff2ps and fax2tiff utilities at runtime as
backend. In KDE 3.3.x the code requiring libtiff or any other
runtime dependencies has been replaced by a native solution
that is unaffected by the mentioned vulnerabilities.
Due to the complexity of the change, no simple diff is
provided. The problems have been addressed in the KDE 3.3.2
release.
As a workaround, you can remove the kfax binary and the
kfaxpart.la KPart from your system to be on the safe
side.
3. Impact:
Specially crafted fax files can trigger buffer overflows
in libtiff and execute arbitrary code.
4. Solution:
Source code updates have been made available which fix these
vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.
5. Patch:
No patches are being made available due to complexity of the change.
6. Time line and credits:
13/10/2004 KDE Security Team alerted by Than Ngo
28/10/2004 private libtiff fork removed from CVS, updated
packages finished.
XX/11/2004 Regression fixing, several refinements.

CESA-2004-006 - rev 3

libtiff-3.8.1 image decoder parsing flaws
=========================================

Programs:          libtiff, and users of libtiff such as GNOME and KDE
                   (konqueror and mail clients are of particular concern).
Severity:          Compromise of account used to browse malicious TIFF file.
CAN identifier(s): CAN-2004-0803

This advisory lists code flaws discovered by inspection of the libtiff code.
Specifically, libtiff-3.8.1 was investigated. Unfortunately, due to the size
of libtiff, only a limited scan for flaws was possible. These flaws are
likely to typify others present.

Very brief libtiff summary: libtiff is an encoder / decoder for the TIFF image
format. The TIFF image format is an incredibly rich format featuring multiple
possible encodings and formats. The encodings include JPEG, LZW, ZIP, log-based
encodings and many more - from many different companies such as NeXT, SGI and
Pixar.

Flaw 1. Heap-based overflow during RLE decoding in tif_next.c

      off = (bp[[0]](#0) * 256) + bp[[1]](#1);
      n = (bp[[2]](#2) * 256) + bp[[3]](#3);
      if (cc < 4+n)
        goto bad;
      _TIFFmemcpy(row+off, bp+4, n);

Here, off and n are arbitrary values from the TIFF. Bounds checking is
performed on the data source buffer, but not the data destination buffer.

Demo TIFF: <http://scary.beasts.org/misc/bad_next.tiff>
(note that memory is subtly corrupted but may not result in an immediate
crash)

Flaw 2. Heap-based overflow during RLE decoding in tif_thunder.c

    case THUNDER_RUN:   /* pixel run */
      /*
       * Replicate the last pixel n times,
       * where n is the lower-order 6 bits.
       */
      if (npixels & 1) {
        op[[0]](#0) |= lastpixel;
        lastpixel = *op++; npixels++; n--;
      } else
        lastpixel |= lastpixel << 4;
      npixels += n;
      for (; n > 0; n -= 2)
        *op++ = (tidataval_t) lastpixel;

Here, n is an arbitrary value from the TIFF, and is used to drive a copy count
into the output without bounds checking.

Demo TIFF: <http://scary.beasts.org/misc/bad_thunder.tiff>
(note that memory is subtly corrupted but may not result in an immediate
crash)

Flaw 3. Possible overflow in tif_luv.c

A TIFF file to confirm this has not been crafted - but it appears that there
may be heap-based overflows when doing RLE decoding:

  for (shft = 2*8; (shft -= 8) >= 0; ) {
    for (i = 0; i < npixels && cc > 0; )
      if (*bp >= 128) {   /* run */
        rc = *bp++ + (2-128);
        b = (int16)(*bp++ << shft);
        cc -= 2;
        while (rc--)
[*]       tp[i++] |= b;
      } else {      /* non-run */
        rc = *bp++;   /* nul is noop */
        while (--cc && rc--)
[*]       tp[i++] |= (int16)*bp++ << shft;

Lines marked with a [*] exhibit a suspicious lack of checking on the size of
the output buffer. Note that tif_luv.c contains multiple versions of the RLE
decoder for different image depths, and all look similarly dangerous.

# tiff: Buffer overflows in image decoding — GLSA **200410-11**

Multiple heap-based overflows have been found in the tiff library image
decoding routines, potentially allowing to execute arbitrary code with the
rights of the user viewing a malicious image.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.6.1-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.6.1-r2** |

| Package | **media-gfx/xv** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **3.10a-r7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.10a-r8** |

### Background

The tiff library contains encoding and decoding routines for the Tag Image
File Format. It is called by numerous programs, including GNOME and KDE, to
help in displaying TIFF images. xv is a multi-format image manipulation
utility that is statically linked to the tiff library.

### Description

Chris Evans found heap-based overflows in RLE decoding routines in
tif\_next.c, tif\_thunder.c and potentially tif\_luv.c.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a carefully crafted TIFF
image file, which would potentially lead to execution of arbitrary code
with the rights of the user viewing the image. This affects any program
that makes use of the tiff library, including GNOME and KDE web browsers or
mail readers.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All tiff library users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=media-libs/tiff-3.6.1-r2"
 # emerge ">=media-libs/tiff-3.6.1-r2"
```

xv makes use of the tiff library and needs to be recompiled to receive the
new patched version of the library. All xv users should also upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=media-gfx/xv-3.10a-r8"
 # emerge ">=media-gfx/xv-3.10a-r8"
```
