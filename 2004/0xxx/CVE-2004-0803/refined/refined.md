{
  "CVE-2004-0803": {
    "match": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Multiple heap-based buffer overflows exist in the libtiff library's RLE decoding routines due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflows"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user or cause a denial-of-service condition.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Specially crafted TIFF image files"
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to entice a user to view a malicious TIFF image.",
       "affected_components": [
        "libtiff library",
         "Applications using libtiff such as GNOME and KDE (konqueror and mail clients)"
         ]
    },
      "additional_details": "The vulnerabilities are located in the `tif_next.c`, `tif_thunder.c`, and potentially `tif_luv.c` files. Specifically, the flaws arise from insufficient bounds checking during RLE (Run Length Encoding) decoding. Arbitrary values from the TIFF file are used to calculate offsets and copy counts into the output buffer without verifying the buffer's boundaries."
