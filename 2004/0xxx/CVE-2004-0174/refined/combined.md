## Apache HTTP Server vulnerable to DoS race condition in the handling of short-lived connections

#### Vulnerability Note VU#132110

Original Release Date: 2004-03-24 | Last Revised: 2004-08-25

---

### Overview

A race condition exists in Apache 2 HTTP Server that may cause a denial-of-service condition on some platforms.

### Description

| Apache HTTP Server versions 2.0.48 and prior contain a race condition in the handling of short-lived connections. According to the [Apache anouncement](http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/Announcement2.html), when using multiple listening sockets, a short-lived connection on a rarely-used socket may cause the child process to hold the accept mutex, blocking new connections from being served until another connection uses the socket.  This vulnerability does not affect Apache 2.x servers running on FreeBSD or Linux. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A denial-of-service situation may occur due the race condition until another connection is made the the socket. |
| --- |

### Solution

| This problem is resolved in [Apache HTTP Server 2.0.49](http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi). |
| --- |

These include a possible denial-of-service attack as well as the ability to possible pipe shell escapes through Apache's errorlog (which could create an exploit if the error log is read in a terminal program that does not filter such escapes).  We recommend that sites running Apache upgrade to the new Apache package.  More details about these issues may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0987   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0020   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0174   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0993   Here are the details from the Slackware 9.1 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ Wed May 12 13:06:39 PDT 2004 patches/packages/apache-1.3.29-i486-2.tgz:  Patched four security issues   in the Apache web server as noted on http://httpd.apache.org.   These security fixes were backported from Apache 1.3.31:      In mod_digest, verify whether the nonce returned in the client     response is one we issued ourselves.  This problem does not affect     mod_auth_digest. (CAN-2003-0987)      Escape arbitrary data before writing into the errorlog.  (CAN-2003-0020)      Fix starvation issue on listening sockets where a short-lived connection     on a rarely-accessed listening socket will cause a child to hold the     accept mutex and block out new connections until another connection     arrives on that rarely-accessed listening socket.  (CAN-2004-0174)      Fix parsing of Allow/Deny rules using IP addresses without a netmask;     issue is only known to affect big-endian 64-bit platforms (CAN-2003-0993)    For more details, see:     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0987     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0020     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0174     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0993    (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  Updated package for Slackware 8.1: ftp://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-8.1/patches/packages/apache-1.3.29-i386-2.tgz  Updated package for Slackware 9.0: ftp://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-9.0/patches/packages/apache-1.3.29-i386-2.tgz  Updated package for Slackware 9.1: ftp://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-9.1/patches/packages/apache-1.3.29-i486-2.tgz  Updated packages for Slackware -current: ftp://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-current/slackware/n/apache-1.3.31-i486-1.tgz (these related packages are also available) ftp://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-current/slackware/n/mod_ssl-2.8.17_1.3.31-i486-2.tgz ftp://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-current/slackware/n/php-4.3.6-i486-2.tgz   MD5 signatures: +-------------+  Slackware 8.1 package: 53949a74ba3dd0a01271e3aa1178e082  apache-1.3.29-i386-2.tgz  Slackware 9.0 package: 64ede1f5637736842502301eb5bd727d  apache-1.3.29-i386-2.tgz  Slackware 9.1 package: ec5dad948d8b17b82b91d756a5c6b0f9  apache-1.3.29-i486-2.tgz  Slackware -current packages: a925f8be7b8bbcb7e4a77e2ef755988a  apache-1.3.31-i486-1.tgz 684626575e1c2a783b3d8d208876aab4  mod_ssl-2.8.17_1.3.31-i486-2.tgz ad27d5f96281e11567184411b7c0720e  php-4.3.6-i486-2.tgz   Installation instructions: +------------------------+  First, stop apache:  # apachectl stop  Next, upgrade the Apache package as root: (if you're running -current, upgrade mod_ssl and php as well)  # upgradepkg apache-1.3.29-i486-2.tgz  Finally, restart apache:  # apachectl start  Or, if you're running a secure server with mod_ssl:  # apachectl startssl   +-----+  Slackware Linux Security Team http://slackware.com/gpg-key security@slackware.com  +------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | To leave the slackware-security mailing list:                          | +------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Send an email to majordomo@slackware.com with this text in the body of | | the email message:                                                     | |                                                                        | |   unsubscribe slackware-security                                       | |                                                                        | | You will get a confirmation message back containing instructions to    | | complete the process.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Apache 1.3: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200405-22**

Several security vulnerabilities have been fixed in the latest release of
Apache 1.3.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.31** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.31** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems. The goal of this
project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that
provides services in tune with the current HTTP standards.

### Description

On 64-bit big-endian platforms, mod\_access does not properly parse
Allow/Deny rules using IP addresses without a netmask which could result in
failure to match certain IP addresses.

Terminal escape sequences are not filtered from error logs. This could be
used by an attacker to insert escape sequences into a terminal emulater
vulnerable to escape sequences.

mod\_digest does not properly verify the nonce of a client response by using
a AuthNonce secret. This could permit an attacker to replay the response of
another website. This does not affect mod\_auth\_digest.

On certain platforms there is a starvation issue where listening sockets
fails to handle short-lived connection on a rarely-accessed listening
socket. This causes the child to hold the accept mutex and block out new
connections until another connection arrives on the same rarely-accessed
listening socket thus leading to a denial of service.

### Impact

These vulnerabilities could lead to attackers bypassing intended access
restrictions, denial of service, and possibly execution of arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All users should upgrade to the latest stable version of Apache 1.3.

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=www-servers/apache-1.3.31"
 # emerge ">=www-servers/apache-1.3.31"
```
