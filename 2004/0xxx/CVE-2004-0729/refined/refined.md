The provided content relates to CVE-2004-0729.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in uninitialized arrays within the phpBB code. When `register_globals` is enabled on the server, these uninitialized arrays become vulnerable to manipulation through specially crafted requests, leading to both full path disclosure and cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Full Path Disclosure:** Exploitable through uninitialized arrays, revealing the server's internal file paths.
2.  **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** User-supplied input is not properly sanitized, allowing injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **Full Path Disclosure:** Allows an attacker to gain knowledge of the server's filesystem structure, potentially aiding further attacks.
2.  **XSS:** Enables attackers to inject malicious client-side scripts into the user's browser, which can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors involve sending crafted HTTP GET requests with specific query parameters to various phpBB files. The parameters manipulate uninitialized arrays, resulting in either path disclosure or XSS.
- Example for Full Path Disclosure:
  - `http://localhost/phpbb208/index.php?category_rows=waraxe`
  - `http://localhost/phpbb208/faq.php?faq=waraxe`
  - `http://localhost/phpbb208/faq.php?mode=bbcode&faq=waraxe`
  - `http://localhost/phpbb208/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=2&ranksrow=waraxe`
- Example for XSS:
  -  `http://localhost/phpbb208/index.php?category_rows[0][cat_id]=1&category_rows[0][cat_title]=waraxe<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>&category_rows[0][cat_order]=99`
  -  `http://localhost/phpbb208/faq.php?faq[0][0]=f00<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>bar&faq[0][1]=waraxe`
  -  `http://localhost/phpbb208/faq.php?mode=bbcode&faq[0][0]=f00<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>bar&faq[0][1]=waraxe`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected phpBB installation.
- The server must have `register_globals` enabled for the vulnerabilities to be exploited.
