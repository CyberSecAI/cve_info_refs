**Summary of Vulnerability:**
The provided content describes a vulnerability in OpenSSL related to the handling of Kerberos cipher suites during the SSL/TLS handshake. This vulnerability is identified as CAN-2004-0112, which is the same as CVE-2004-0112.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a flaw in the SSL/TLS handshaking code within OpenSSL when using Kerberos ciphersuites. Specifically, the code does not properly validate the length of Kerberos tickets during the handshake process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper length validation of Kerberos tickets within the SSL/TLS handshake code.
- Out-of-bounds read due to the missing length check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (DoS) on the server.
- The vulnerability leads to a crash of the OpenSSL library, which could disrupt services or applications depending on OpenSSL.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, exploiting the vulnerability over a network connection.
- Attackers send a specially crafted SSL/TLS handshake to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft specific SSL/TLS handshakes that trigger the vulnerability using Kerberos cipher suites.
- No authentication is required.

**Affected Versions:**
- OpenSSL versions 0.9.7a, 0.9.7b, and 0.9.7c are specifically mentioned as vulnerable.
- The vulnerability exists in code that processes SSL/TLS handshakes using Kerberos cipher suites.

**Unaffected Versions:**
- OpenSSL 0.9.6 is stated not to be affected.
- OpenSSL 0.9.7d and 0.9.6m are the recommended versions to upgrade to.

**Additional Notes:**
- Most applications do not utilize Kerberos ciphersuites and are therefore not affected.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL core team.
- The OpenSSL team thanked Codenomicon for providing the TLS Test Tool, which helped discover the vulnerability.

**Relevant content excerpts:**

*   "Stephen Henson discovered a flaw in SSL/TLS handshaking code when using Kerberos ciphersuites.  A remote attacker could perform a carefully crafted SSL/TLS handshake against a server configured to use Kerberos ciphersuites in such a way as to cause OpenSSL to crash."
*   "The SSL/TLS handshaking, when using Kerberos ciphersuites, does not properly check the length of Kerberos tickets during a handshake, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted SSL/TLS handshake that causes an out-of-bounds read."
*   "Versions 0.9.7a, 0.9.7b, and 0.9.7c of OpenSSL are affected by this issue. Any application that makes use of OpenSSL's SSL/TLS library may be affected."
*   "A remote, unauthenticated attacker could cause a denial of service in an application that uses OpenSSL with Kerberos cipher suites."
*   "Upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.7d. Alternatively, upgrade or apply a patch as specified by your vendor. Note that it is necessary to recompile any applications that are statically linked to OpenSSL libraries."
*   "The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0112 to this issue."
