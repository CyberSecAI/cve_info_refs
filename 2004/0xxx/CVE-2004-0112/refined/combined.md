# Multiple OpenSSL Vulnerabilities — GLSA **200403-03**

Three vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL via a commercial test
suite for the TLS protocol developed by Codenomicon Ltd.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.9.7c** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.7d**= **0.9.6m** |

### Background

The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing
the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS
v1) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography
library.

### Description

1. Testing performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test
   Tool uncovered a null-pointer assignment in the do\_change\_cipher\_spec()
   function. A remote attacker could perform a carefully crafted SSL/TLS
   handshake against a server that used the OpenSSL library in such a way
   as to cause OpenSSL to crash. Depending on the application this could
   lead to a denial of service. All versions of OpenSSL from 0.9.6c to
   0.9.6l inclusive and from 0.9.7a to 0.9.7c inclusive are affected by
   this issue.
2. A flaw has been discovered in SSL/TLS handshaking code when using
   Kerberos ciphersuites. A remote attacker could perform a carefully
   crafted SSL/TLS handshake against a server configured to use Kerberos
   ciphersuites in such a way as to cause OpenSSL to crash. Most
   applications have no ability to use Kerberos cipher suites and will
   therefore be unaffected. Versions 0.9.7a, 0.9.7b, and 0.9.7c of OpenSSL
   are affected by this issue.
3. Testing performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test
   Tool uncovered a bug in older versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 that can lead
   to a Denial of Service attack (infinite loop). This issue was traced to
   a fix that was added to OpenSSL 0.9.6d some time ago. This issue will
   affect vendors that ship older versions of OpenSSL with backported
   security patches.

### Impact

Although there are no public exploits known for bug, users are
recommended to upgrade to ensure the security of their infrastructure.

### Workaround

There is no immediate workaround; a software upgrade is required. The
vulnerable function in the code has been rewritten.

### Resolution

All users are recommened to upgrade openssl to either 0.9.7d or 0.9.6m:

```
 # emerge sync
 # emerge -pv ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.7d"
 # emerge ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.7d"
```

OpenSSL Security Advisory [17 March 2004]

Updated versions of OpenSSL are now available which correct two
security issues:

1. Null-pointer assignment during SSL handshake
===============================================

Testing performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test
Tool uncovered a null-pointer assignment in the
do_change_cipher_spec() function.  A remote attacker could perform a
carefully crafted SSL/TLS handshake against a server that used the
OpenSSL library in such a way as to cause OpenSSL to crash.  Depending
on the application this could lead to a denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2004-0079 to this issue.

All versions of OpenSSL from 0.9.6c to 0.9.6k inclusive and from
0.9.7a to 0.9.7c inclusive are affected by this issue.  Any
application that makes use of OpenSSL's SSL/TLS library may be
affected.  Please contact your application vendor for details.

2. Out-of-bounds read affects Kerberos ciphersuites
===================================================

Stephen Henson discovered a flaw in SSL/TLS handshaking code when
using Kerberos ciphersuites.  A remote attacker could perform a
carefully crafted SSL/TLS handshake against a server configured to use
Kerberos ciphersuites in such a way as to cause OpenSSL to crash.
Most applications have no ability to use Kerberos ciphersuites and
will therefore be unaffected.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2004-0112 to this issue.

Versions 0.9.7a, 0.9.7b, and 0.9.7c of OpenSSL are affected by this
issue.  Any application that makes use of OpenSSL's SSL/TLS library
may be affected.  Please contact your application vendor for details.

Recommendations
- ---------------

Upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.7d or 0.9.6m.  Recompile any OpenSSL applications
statically linked to OpenSSL libraries.

OpenSSL 0.9.7d and OpenSSL 0.9.6m are available for download via HTTP and
FTP from the following master locations (you can find the various FTP
mirrors under <http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html>):

    ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

The distribution file names are:

    o openssl-0.9.7d.tar.gz
      MD5 checksum: 1b49e90fc8a75c3a507c0a624529aca5

    o openssl-0.9.6m.tar.gz [normal]
      MD5 checksum: 1b63bfdca1c37837dddde9f1623498f9
    o openssl-engine-0.9.6m.tar.gz [engine]
      MD5 checksum: 4c39d2524bd466180f9077f8efddac8c

The checksums were calculated using the following command:

    openssl md5 openssl-0.9*.tar.gz

Credits
- -------

Patches for these issues were created by Dr Stephen Henson
(steve@openssl.org) of the OpenSSL core team.  The OpenSSL team would
like to thank Codenomicon for supplying the TLS Test Tool which was
used to discover these vulnerabilities, and Joe Orton of Red Hat for
performing the majority of the testing.

## OpenSSL does not adequately validate length of Kerberos ticket during SSL/TLS handshake

#### Vulnerability Note VU#484726

Original Release Date: 2004-03-17 | Last Revised: 2004-03-26

---

### Overview

OpenSSL contains a vulnerability in code that processes SSL/TLS handshakes when configured to use the Kerberos cipher suites. This vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to cause OpenSSL to crash.

### Description

| [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/) implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security ([TLS](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt)) protocols and includes a general purpose cryptographic library. SSL and TLS are commonly used to provide authentication, encryption, integrity, and non-repudiation services to network applications such as HTTP, IMAP, POP3, LDAP, and others.  According to [RFC2712](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2712.txt), TLS allows clients and servers to negotiate cipher suites to meet specific security and administrative policies. In order to provide Kerberos-based authentication, TLS supports the Kerberos cipher suites.Versions 0.9.7a, 0.9.7b, and 0.9.7c of OpenSSL contain a vulnerability in code that processes SSL/TLS handshakes using Kerberos cipher suites. This vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker using a specially crafted SSL/TLS handshake to a server configured to use the Kerberos cipher suites. When the server attempts to process this request, OpenSSL could crash. OpenSSL 0.9.6 is not affected.Further information is available in an advisory from [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20040317.txt) and [NISCC/224012/OpenSSL/2](http://www.uniras.gov.uk/l1/l2/l3/alerts2004/alert-1204.txt). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker could cause a denial of service in an application that uses OpenSSL with Kerberos cipher suites. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or Patch**Upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.7d. Alternatively, upgrade or apply a patch as specified by your vendor. Note that it is necessary to recompile any applications that are statically linked to OpenSSL libraries. |

[Slackware](http://www.slackware.org/)

# Slackware

The story of Slackware is pretty darn interesting, when you start to dig a little deeper. Perhaps the most compelling element to the narrative is its longevity. Some twenty-five years after it was first released to the world, Slackware is indeed still going strong. It remains a preferred Linux distribution method by many. As of this writing, it is also still being updated at a decently steady pace.

If you’re just starting to learn about Linux distribution options, you will hear about Slackware a lot. There are several reasons as to why that is the case.

An Introduction To Slackware
In order to better appreciate the longevity of Slackware, we have to cover two major subjects. First, let’s take a quick at the history of Slackware. That begins in 1993, although work began on it even earlier than that. With this foundation, we can then move on to the benefits of Slackware. These are benefits that have remained consistent through the decades. They can go a long way towards explaining the appeal of Slackware in 2019.

As of this year, Slackware is the longest-standing Linux distribution choice that is still being updated.

A Brief History Of Slackware
Working from an even older Linux distribution known as Softlanding Linux, Patrick Volkerding created Slackware in 1993. It was released to the world at large in April of that year, and it has been well-regarded and updated ever since. One of the main purposes for the creation of Slackware in the first place was to establish the most Unix-like distribution option for Linux. Many believe they have succeeded in this regard time and time again.

Both stability and simplicity in design have always been the goals of Slackware. According to Scott Chow of [Theblogstarter.com](https://www.theblogstarter.com), Slackware continues to aspire to make as few changes as humanly possible to software packages that come from the upstream. Furthermore, it also tries to avoid anticipating use cases, or precluding the decisions of the user. There is nothing in the way of a graphical procedure for installation. You also won’t find automatic dependency resolutions for any given software package. It utilizes plain text files, and utilizes a small set of shell scripts, when it comes to configuration and administration. Booting it will take you to an environment of what can be described as a common-line interface.

Slackware has been updated a few times throughout the years. Volkerding continues to spearhead these updates, which is perhaps why Slackware has maintained such impressive consistency from 1993 to the present. The most recent update was released in June of 2016—just two years ago.

As we get ready for a more detailed look at the benefits of Slackware, let’s take a quick look at some of the main Slackware features you can expect.

Slackware Features
One of the great things about Slackware is that it covers a lot of different needs right out of the gate. It is designed in such a way that you should be able to start working with it pretty quickly, and that would be regardless of your level of experience.

We won’t cover every single Slackware feature here, but let’s unpack some of the top things to expect:

• X-Window Systems
• Developmental environments for both C and C++
• The ability to use Perl
• Various utilities related to networking
• A server for mail
• A server for the web
• A server for FTP-related needs
• GNU Image Manipulation capabilities

As you can see, Slackware brings a lot to the table from the beginning. That is certainly an impressive benefit unto itself, but there are so many other potential advantages of using Slackware to keep in mind.

Slackware Benefits Explained
Ultimately, it is obviously up to you to decide if Slackware is right for your needs. The great thing about Slackware is that you will know the answer to that almost immediately. Many find it to be a straightforward collection of features that they can engage immediately. Others see management and administration of Slackware as being riddled with tedious challenges and time-consuming requirements.

For now, let’s explore some of the most commonly-cited benefits of using Slackware for Linux:

• Stability: Even the people who find Slackware to be too challenging will tell you that it at least benefits from being enormously stable. Over the course of the past twenty-five years, Slackware has continued to function without a whole lot of problems. It has moved nicely with the times, but it really hasn’t changed all that much. Few things related to computers have such stability.
• Security: Even for Linux distributions, there are traps and pitfalls that need to be constantly kept in mind. By and large, Slackware doesn’t have that problem. It probably helps that new versions of Slackware do not come out until everything is absolutely ready.
• Neutral: Remember that Slackware isn’t dependent upon a package manager. This is largely due to the fact that the applications are installed through a source. Slackware is not affiliated with any company either. Distribution was community-driven in the early 90s, and Slackware remains committed to that a quarter of a century later.
• Speediness: Another thing to keep in mind with Slackware is that it will only install what you absolutely want. Because of this, and keeping in mind the release policy we mentioned above, Slackware tends to run the fastest of the Linux distributions.
• Clean configuration: One of the big knocks against Slackware is that it doesn’t have graphical config utilities. No matter what you want to do, you are going to need to use the command line. Some people find this frustrating, but others would argue that this gives you the cleanest possible config files to work with.
• Want to understand Linux: There are other benefits to Slackware, but this one might just be our favorite. Even if you initially think Slackware has a higher learning curve than other distributions, there is a strong argument to be made that it will be worth the extra effort. Some don’t even experience this extra effort. However, if you do, think about Linux in broader terms. If you need to have a comprehensive understanding of Linux, you really can’t ask for a better teacher than Slackware. When you’ve mastered everything there is to know about Slackware, you will have pretty much mastered using Linux, as well.

Conclusion
Slackbuilds and strong IT cred are two more benefits that are worth taking to heart. At the end of the day, nothing in the world of Linux distributions can exist without a certain measure of controversy and disagreement. People also tend to be fiercely passionate and loyal about their favorite distribution. Nonetheless, Slackware has a staying power that would be absurd to ignore. It has worked for an incredibly long time, and it has done so in a field that has little time or patience for things that can’t be intensely/comprehensively useful. You could certainly make the argument that it has done more for bringing people to the world of Linux than just about anything else.

Is Slackware right for you? At this point, you are in the best position possible to make that determination. As we mentioned before, Slackware is best experienced in a hands-on capacity. You can research the subject to death, and you still won’t really know for sure. The only thing we can promise you, as we mentioned before, is that you are going to be able to decide how you feel about Slackware pretty quickly. It could be one of the best decisions you have ever made, in terms of working with a distribution that helps you meet your goals.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

SSRT4717 rev.0 Management Agents: remote DoS with OpenSSL SSL/TLS
                                  in HP WBEM Services

 -----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTICE:
 There are no restrictions for distribution of this Bulletin
 provided that it remains complete and intact.

 The information in this Security bulletin should be acted upon
 as soon as possible.

INITIAL RELEASE:    05 May 2004

POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:    Remote Denial of Service (DoS)

SOURCE:    HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY
HP Software Security Response Team

REFERENCES:    CAN 2004-079, CAN-2004-0112

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:

A potential security vulnerability has been identified with
Management Agents using OpenSSL and SSL/TLS which could be
exploited remotely to create a denial of service (DoS) in HP WBEM
Services on HP-UX and RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.

HP9000 Servers running HP-UX release B.11.00,  B.11.11 and
B.11.23 with versions of the following  products are affected:

- - HP WBEM Services for HP-UX, A.01.05.08 or earlier (B8465BA).
  Version A.01.05.08 of this product includes OpenSSL 0.9.6k.

- - HP WBEM Services for HP-UX, A.02.00.00 (B8465BA).
  This product includes OpenSSL 0.9.6k.

RedHat Enterprise Linux,  RHEL AS 2.1 with the following HP
product numbers/versions are affected:

- - HP WBEM Services for Linux, A.02.00.01

BACKGROUND:

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has identified
potential vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (CAN-2004-079,
CAN-2004-0112).

1. The do_change_cipher_spec function in OpenSSL allows remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted SSL/TLS
   handshake that triggers a null dereference.
   <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0079>

2. The SSL/TLS handshaking, when using Kerberos ciphersuites, does
   not properly check the length of Kerberos tickets during a
   handshake, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
   service via a crafted SSL/TLS handshake that causes an
   out-of-bounds read.
   <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0112>

It affects the following HP product numbers/versions on HP-UX
releases B.11.00, B.11.11, and B.11.23:

 - HP WBEM Services for HP-UX, A.01.05.08 or earlier (B8465BA)

 - HP WBEM Services for HP-UX, A.02.00.00 (B8465BA)

It also affects the following HP product numbers/versions on
RHEL AS 2.1:

 - HP WBEM Services for Linux, A.02.00.01
