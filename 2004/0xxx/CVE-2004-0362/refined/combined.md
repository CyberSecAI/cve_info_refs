How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Internet Security Systems Protocol Analysis Module (PAM) does not properly handle ICQ server response messages

#### Vulnerability Note VU#947254

Original Release Date: 2004-03-20 | Last Revised: 2009-06-12

---

### Overview

The Protocol Analysis Module (PAM) used by Internet Security Systems (ISS) intrusion detection and prevention products does not properly handle ICQ server response messages. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code by sending a specially crafted UDP packet.

### Description

| ISS intrusion detection and prevention products include a component that performs application layer inspection of the ICQ protocol. From the ISS [Alert](http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/alerts/id/166):  *The Protocol Analysis Module (PAM) facilitates the parsing of network protocols in order to perform further analysis and attack detection. ICQ is a popular instant messaging application developed by ICQ Inc., a subsidiary of America Online. In order to detect attacks targeting instant messaging software, PAM parses several IM protocols including ICQ.*A UDP packet with a source port of 4000 is handled by the PAM as an ICQ server response message. The PAM contains a stack buffer overflow in code that parses ICQ server response messages. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability with a specially crafted UDP packet. In most cases, it is trivial for an attacker to spoof the source of a UDP packet. Since RealSecure and BlackICE products listen on the broadcast interface, an attacker may be able to reach multiple targets with one packet.As noted in the ISS [Alert](http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/alerts/id/166), ISS Proventia, RealSecure, and BlackICE products share the vulnerable PAM code. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process running the PAM. RealSecure and BlackICE products run on Microsoft Windows platforms with SYSTEM privileges.An Internet worm called "[Witty](http://www.us-cert.gov/current/current_activity.html#witty)" exploits this vulnerability in RealSecure and BlackICE products on Windows systems (Proventia products are not affected). The worm overwrites sections of the target system's hard drive, which could corrupt stored data and render the target system inoperable. For more information, please see the ISS [Alert](http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/alerts/id/167). |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**Upgrade as specified in the ISS [Alert](http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/alerts/id/166). ISS distributed updates prior to the public release of information about this vulnerability. |
| --- |

| **Block or restrict access**Block UDP packets with a source port of 4000. Note that this will prevent ICQ applications from operating. |

Description:

A critical vulnerability has been discovered in the PAM (Protocol
Analysis Module) component used in all current ISS host, server, and
network device solutions. A routine within the Protocol Analysis Module
(PAM) that monitors ICQ server responses contains a series of stack
based buffer overflow vulnerabilities. If the source port of an incoming
UDP packet is 4000, it is assumed to be an ICQ v5 server response. Any
incoming packet matching this criterion will be forwarded to the
vulnerable routine. By delivering a carefully crafted response packet to
the broadcast address of a network operating RealSecure/BlackICE agents
an attacker can achieve anonymous, remote SYSTEM access across all
vulnerable nodes.

Technical Description:

If the PAM ICQ response handling routine receives a SRV_META_USER
response the nickname, firstname, lastname, and email address buffers
will be assigned a pointer into a general purpose structure. Later in
the parent routine each of these buffers will be temporarily copied into
a 512 byte stack based buffer without any sanity checking. In order to
reach the vulnerable function calls the attacker needs to craft a
SRV_MULTI response that contains two embedded response packets, a
SRV_USER_ONLINE response and a SRV_META_USER response. If both are
supplied then a condition is met and the entire ICQ decoder structure is
filled out, and the vulnerable sprintf calls will be followed.

Since UDP is a stateless protocol, most IDS products are incapable of
keeping state or record of a concurrent connection. Such a feature would
be too costly to the performance of the IDS engine. With this in mind,
this flaw can be exploited by sending a single spoofed datagram.

In our test environment we successfully compromised a BlackICE
installation with "paranoid" configuration enabled, application
protection enabled, file sharing support disabled, and network
neighborhood support disabled.

It should be noted that the BlackICE/RealSecure engine listens for
packets received on the broadcast interface. This allows the
vulnerability to be exploited simultaneously across every vulnerable
host within a targeted network by issuing a single, spoofed, UDP
datagram.
