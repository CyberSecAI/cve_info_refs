{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `send-pr.sh` script in MIT krb5 creates temporary files in world-writable directories with predictable names, leading to a symlink attack vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure temporary file creation",
      "Predictable temporary file names",
      "Use of world-writable directories for temporary files",
      "Symlink vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can create symbolic links in the temporary files directory, pointing to a valid file. When `send-pr.sh` is executed, the linked file will be overwritten with the privileges of the user running the utility (potentially root). This could lead to arbitrary file overwrite and system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local symlink attack"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be a local user with the ability to create symbolic links in the temporary file directory. They also need to know or predict the temporary file names."
