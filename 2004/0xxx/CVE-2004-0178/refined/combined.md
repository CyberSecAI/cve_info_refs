### Background

The Linux kernel is responsible for managing the core aspects of a
GNU/Linux system, providing an interface for core system applications
as well as providing the essential structure and capability to access
hardware that is needed for a running system.

### Description

Multiple flaws have been discovered in the Linux kernel. This advisory
corrects the following issues:

* CAN-2004-0109: This vulnerability allows privilege escalation using
  ISO9660 file systems through a buffer overflow via a malformed file
  system containing a long symbolic link entry. This can allow arbitrary
  code execution at kernel level.
* CAN-2004-0133: The XFS file system in 2.4 series kernels has an
  information leak by which data in the memory can be written to the
  device hosting the file system, allowing users to obtain portions of
  kernel memory by reading the raw block device.
* CAN-2004-0177: The ext3 file system in 2.4 series kernels does not
  properly initialize journal descriptor blocks, causing an information
  leak by which data in the memory can be written to the device hosting
  the file system, allowing users to obtain portions of kernel memory by
  reading the raw device.
* CAN-2004-0181: The JFS file system in 2.4 series kernels has an
  information leak by which data in the memory can be written to the
  device hosting the file system, allowing users to obtain portions of
  kernel memory by reading the raw device.
* CAN-2004-0178: The OSS Sound Blaster [R] Driver has a Denial of Service
  vulnerability since it does not handle certain sample sizes properly.
  This allows local users to hang the kernel.
* CAN-2004-0228: Due to an integer signedness error in the CPUFreq /proc
  handler code in 2.6 series Linux kernels, local users can escalate
  their privileges.
* CAN-2004-0229: The framebuffer driver in 2.6 series kernel drivers does
  not use the fb\_copy\_cmap method of copying structures. The impact of
  this issue is unknown, however.
* CAN-2004-0394: A buffer overflow in the panic() function of 2.4 series
  Linux kernels exists, but it may not be exploitable under normal
  circumstances due to its functionality.
* CAN-2004-0427: The do\_fork() function in both 2.4 and 2.6 series Linux
  kernels does not properly decrement the mm\_count counter when an error
  occurs, triggering a memory leak that allows local users to cause a
  Denial of Service by exhausting other applications of memory; causing
  the kernel to panic or to kill services.
* CAN-2004-0495: Multiple vulnerabilities found by the Sparse source
  checker in the kernel allow local users to escalate their privileges or
  gain access to kernel memory.
* CAN-2004-0535: The e1000 NIC driver does not properly initialize memory
  structures before using them, allowing users to read kernel memory.
* CAN-2004-0554: 2.4 and 2.6 series kernels running on an x86 or an AMD64
  architecture allow local users to cause a Denial of Service by a total
  system hang, due to an infinite loop that triggers a signal handler
  with a certain sequence of fsave and frstor instructions.
* Local DoS in PaX: If ASLR is enabled as a GRSecurity PaX feature, a
  Denial of Service can be achieved by putting the kernel into an
  infinite loop. Only 2.6 series GRSecurity kernels are affected by this
  issue.
* RSBAC 1.2.3 JAIL issues: A flaw in the RSBAC JAIL implementation allows
  suid/sgid files to be created inside the jail since the relevant module
  does not check the corresponding mode values. This can allow privilege
  escalation inside the jail. Only rsbac-(dev-)sources are affected by
  this issue.

### Impact

Arbitrary code with normal non-super-user privileges may be able to
exploit any of these vulnerabilities; gaining kernel level access to
memory structures and hardware devices. This may be used for further
exploitation of the system, to leak sensitive data or to cause a Denial
of Service on the affected kernel.

### Workaround

Although users may not be affected by certain vulnerabilities, all
kernels are affected by the CAN-2004-0394, CAN-2004-0427 and
CAN-2004-0554 issues which have no workaround. As a result, all users
are urged to upgrade their kernels to patched versions.

### Resolution

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest available sources for
their system:

```
 # emerge sync
 # emerge -pv your-favorite-sources
 # emerge your-favorite-sources

 # # Follow usual procedure for compiling and installing a kernel.
 # # If you use genkernel, run genkernel as you would do normally.
```

> We have found the support from Red Hat to be exemplary. Whenever we need anything from them, they have given it … Red Hat is now our backbone. Our business cannot run if Red Hat is not there.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
