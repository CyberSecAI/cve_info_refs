How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### General Information

## Technical Details

**Executive Summary:**

This is a cumulative update that includes the functionality of all the previously-released updates for Outlook Express 5.5 and Outlook Express 6. Additionally, it eliminates a new vulnerability that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to access files and to take complete control of the affected system. This could occur even if Outlook Express is not used as the default e-mail reader on the system.

Microsoft recommends that customers install this update immediately.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Outlook Express 5.5 SP2 | Outlook Express 6 | Outlook Express 6 SP1 | Outlook Express 6 (64 bit Edition) | Microsoft Outlook Express 6 for Windows Server 2003 | Microsoft Outlook Express 6 for Windows Server 2003 (64-bit Edition) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MHTML URL Processing Vulnerability - [CAN-2004-0380](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2004-0380) | Remote Code Execution | Critical | Critical | Critical | Critical | Critical | Critical |

The above [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**What updates does this release replace?**

This is a cumulative update that includes the functionality of all the previously-released updates for Outlook Express 5.5 and Outlook Express 6. The security bulletin ID and operating systems that are affected for the previous Outlook Express update are listed in the following table.

| Bulletin ID | Microsoft Outlook Express 5.5 SP2 | Microsoft Outlook Express 6 | Microsoft Outlook Express 6 SP1 | Microsoft Outlook Express 6 SP1 (64 bit Edition) | Microsoft Outlook Express 6 for Windows Server 2003 | Microsoft Outlook Express 6 for Windows Server 2003 (64-bit Edition) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **MS03-014** | Replaced | Replaced | Replaced | Replaced | Not Applicable | Not Applicable |

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

By default, Outlook Express is installed on all supported Windows systems. Microsoft recommends that this update be installed immediately on all systems. However, this vulnerability requires a user to be logged on and to be reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently (such as users workstations) are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to read e-mail or to visit Web sites (such as most server systems) are at a reduced risk.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

No. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. However, this configuration does not mitigate this vulnerability.

**I do not use Outlook Express to read e-mail or newsgroups. Am I at risk from this vulnerability?**

Yes. Because Outlook Express is installed by default, customers will be at risk until this update is applied. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through a malicious Web site or through HTML e-mail, regardless of whether Outlook Express is the default e-mail reader.

**I am using Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1) or Windows 2000 SP 3 or later, and I have removed Outlook Express as my default e-mail reader by using the Set Program Access and Defaults tool. Am I still at risk from this vulnerability?**

Yes. Because Outlook Express is installed by default, customers will be at risk until this update is applied. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability either through a malicious Web site or through HTML e-mail, regardless of whether Outlook Express has been selected as the default e-mail reader by using the Set Program Access and Defaults Tool. For more information about the Set Program Access and Defaults tool, visit the following [Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/default.aspx).

## Vulnerability Details

#### MHTML URL Processing Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0380:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the processing of specially crafted MHTML URLs that could allow an attacker's HTML code to run in the Local Machine security zone in Internet Explorer. This could allow an attacker to take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating factors for MHTML URL Processing Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0380:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

  The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all of the following conditions:

  + Apply the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-040](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-040) or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
  + Use Internet Explorer 6 or later
  + Use the Microsoft Outlook E-mail Security Update, use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or later, or use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or later in its default configuration.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

  + The update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin

#### Workarounds for MHTML URL Processing Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0380:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Strengthen the security settings for the Local Machine zone in Internet Explorer**

  Because this vulnerability permits an attacker to run HTML code in the Local Machine security zone, users can reduce the impact of this vulnerability by restricting the default settings in this zone. For more information about these settings, and for more information about the potential impacts of changing these default settings, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [833633](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;833633).

  **Warning:** Microsoft recommends that customers consider these changes to Internet Explorer security settings as a last resort only. If you make these changes, you may lose some functionality for some Windows programs and components. Before you make these changes in a production environment, test the changes extensively to verify that mission-critical programs continue to work correctly for all users.
* **Install** **Outlook E-mail Security Update** **if you are using Outlook 2000 SP1 or earlier.**

  By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been installed.

  Customers who use one or more of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability by having the user click a malicious link in the e-mail.
* **Read e-mail in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or later or if you are using Outlook Express 6 SP1 or later, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack method,**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or later and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view all non-digitally signed e-mail messages or non-encrypted e-mail messages in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about enabling this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [307594](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [291387](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=291387).

**Impact of Workaround**

E-mail that is viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition:

* The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
* Pictures become attachments to avoid loss.
* Because the message is still in Rich Text format or in HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ for MHTML URL Processing Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0380:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run HTML code of their choosing in the Local Machine security zone in Internet Explorer. By running HTML code in the Local Machine zone, an attacker to gain complete control over an affected system. An attacker could take any action on the system, including installing programs, viewing data, changing data, deleting data, or creating new accounts that have full administrative credentials.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability occurs because of the way that Outlook Express processes specially crafted [MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/ms527345.aspx)(MHTML) URLs.

**What are MHTML URLs?**

MHTML stands for [MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/ms527345.aspx). . MHTML is an Internet standard that defines the [MIME](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms527345.aspx) structure that is used to send HTML content in the body of an e-mail message. The MHTML URL Handler in Windows is part of Outlook Express and provides a URL type (MHTML://) that permits MHTML encoded documents to be rendered in applications. Therefore, applications such as Internet Explorer will use Outlook Express to processes MTHML encoded documents.

**What are Internet Explorer security zones?**

Internet Explorer [security zones](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q174360) are a system that divides online content into categories or zones that are based on the trustworthiness of the content. Specific Web domains can be assigned to a zone, depending on how much trust is placed in the content of each domain. The zone then restricts the capabilities of the Web content, based on the zone's policy. By default, most Internet domains are treated as part of the Internet zone. By default, the policy of the Internet zone prevents scripts and other active code from accessing resources on the local system.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could access files on a user's system and could run arbitrary code on a user's system. This code would run in the security context of the user who was currently logged on.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

The remote code execution vulnerability exists in the processing of specially crafted MHTML URLs that could permit an attacker to take complete control of an affected system.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.

An attacker could also create an HTML e-mail message that was designed to exploit the vulnerability. Then an attacker could persuade the user to view the HTML e-mail message. After the user had visited the malicious Web site or viewed the malicious HTML e-mail message, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run HTML code of their choice in the Local Machine zone on the user's system. This could allow an attacker to access files on a user's system and to run arbitrary code on a user's system. This code would run in the security context of the user who was currently logged on.

**What does the update do?**

This update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Outlook Express processes MHTML URLs.

## Outlook Express MHTML protocol handler does not properly validate source of alternate content

#### Vulnerability Note VU#323070

Original Release Date: 2004-04-05 | Last Revised: 2005-06-17

---

### Overview

The Outlook Express MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML Documents (MHTML) protocol handler does not adequately validate the source of alternate content. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to access data and execute script in different security domains. By causing script to be run in the Local Machine Zone, the attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the program that invoked the handler, typically Internet Explorer (IE).

### Description

| **The Cross Domain Security Model**  IE uses a cross-domain security model to maintain separation between browser frames from different sources. This model is designed to prevent code in one domain from accessing data in a different domain. The [Local Machine Zone](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/security/szone/overview/overview.asp#local) is "...an implicit zone for content that exists on the local computer. The content found on the user's computer, except for content that Internet Explorer caches on the local system, is treated with a high level of trust." The determination of what zone and/or domain a URL exists in and what actions can be performed in that zone is made by the [Internet Security Manager Object](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/security/szone/reference/objects/internetsecuritymanager.asp).**HTML Help**The Microsoft [HTML Help](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/vsconHH1Start.asp) system "...is the standard help system for the Windows platform." HTML Help components can be compiled to "...compress HTML, graphic, and other files into a relatively small compiled help (.chm) file...". The resulting compiled Help (CHM) file can then "...be distributed with a software application, or downloaded from the Web." The Help Viewer application "...uses the underlying components of Microsoft Internet Explorer to display help content. It supports HTML, ActiveX, Java, scripting languages (JScript, and Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition)...".**The InfoTech Storage Format**CHM files use the Microsoft InfoTech Storage format (ITS). IE can access components within CHM files (via the [IStorage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/stg/stg/istorage.asp) interface) using several protocol handlers: ms-its, ms-itss, its, mk:@MSITStore.For example, the following URL references an HTML file within a CHM file hosted on a remote web site:  ms-its:http://www.example.com/directory/path/compiledhelpfile.chm:/htmlfile.html  This URL references a local CHM file:  its:file://c:\directory\path\compiledhelpfile.chm:/htmlfile.html  **MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML Documents (MHTML)**MHTML ([RFC 2110](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2110.txt)) provides a way to include multiple components of an HTML document (HTML, images, script, etc.) in a single MIME email message. Outlook Express implements an MHTML protocol handler (mhtml:), and Windows systems use IE to access MHTML URLs. The ITS protocol handlers can reference objects contained within [MHTML](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cdosys/html/_cdosys_mime_encapsulation_of_aggregate_html_documents_mhtml_.asp) documents:  ms-its:mhtml:file://c:\directory\path\mhtmlfile.mhtml  The ITS protocol handlers can specify an alternate location for MHTML content (URL is wrapped):  ms-its:mhtml:file://c:\file\_does\_not\_exist.mhtml!http://www.example.com/directory/path/compiledhelpfile.chm:/htmlfile.html  **The Problem**If the MHTML protocol handler is unable to access the specified MHTML file, (for example, if the file does not exist) the handler will attempt to access the content specified by the alternate location. In the example above, the MHTML protocol handler incorrectly treats HTML content from one domain (htmlfile.html in example.com) as if it were in a different domain (file://, the Local Machine Zone). This is a violation of the cross-domain security model. Testing shows that the ms-its:, its:, and mk:@MSITStore: protocol handlers can act as attack vectors.An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted URL and an HTML document containing script, an ActiveX object, or possibly an IFRAME element. Due to the way IE [determines the MIME type](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/networking/moniker/overview/appendix_a.asp) of a file referenced by a URL, an HTML document may not necessarily have the expected file name extension (.html or .htm). Likewise, a CHM file may not have the expected .chm extension.Functional exploit code is publicly available, and there are reports of incidents involving this vulnerability (e.g., the Ibiza trojan, variants of Bugbear, Bloodhound.Exloit.6).Any program that uses the WebBrowser ActiveX control or the IE HTML rendering engine (MSHTML) may be affected by this vulnerability. Outlook and Outlook Express are affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a victim to view an HTML document (web page, HTML email), an attacker could execute script in a different security domain than the one containing the attacker's document. By causing script to be run in the Local Machine Zone, the attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running IE. The attacker could also read or modify data in other web sites and in the Local Machine Zone (read cookies/content, modify/create content, etc.). |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Install a patch**Install the appropriate cumulative patch for Outlook Express according to Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-013](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-013.mspx). |
| --- |

| **Note: Disabling Active scripting or ActiveX controls is not an effective workaround**Disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls in any zone does not prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability. Disabling these features in the Internet and Local Machine Zones (see MS KB Article [833633](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=833633)) may stop some attacks.**Disable ITS and MHTML protocol handlers**  Disabling the ITS and MHTML protocol handlers may prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Delete or rename the following registry keys:HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\PROTOCOLS\Handler\{ms-its,ms-itss,its,mk,mhtml}Modifying the Windows registry in this way may have unintended consequences. Disabling the ITS protocol handlers will reduce the functionality of the Windows help systems. Plan to undo these changes after patches have been tested and installed.**Do not follow unsolicited links**Do not click on unsolicited URLs received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels.**Read and send email in plain text format**Outlook 2002 SP1 and Outlook 6 SP1 can be configured to view email messages in text format. Consider the security of fellow Internet users and send email in plain text format when possible.**Maintain updated anti-virus software**Anti-virus software with updated virus definitions may identify and prevent some exploit attempts. Variations of exploits or attack vectors may not be detected. Do not rely solely on anti-virus software to defend against this vulnerability. US-CERT maintains a partial list of [antivirus vendors](http://www.us-cert.gov/other_sources/viruses.html#VI).**Use a different web browser**There are a number of significant vulnerabilities in technologies relating to the IE domain/zone security model, the DHTML object model, MIME type determination, and ActiveX. It is possible to reduce exposure to these vulnerabilities by using a different web browser. Such a decision may, however, reduce the functionality of sites that require IE-specific features such as DHTML, VBScript, and ActiveX. Note that using a different web browser will not remove IE from a Windows system, and other programs may invoke IE, the WebBrowser ActiveX control, or the HTML rendering engine (MSHTML). It is possible for a different browser on a Windows system to invoke IE to handle MHTML protocol URLs. |
