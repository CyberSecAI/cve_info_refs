Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2004-0380:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Outlook Express processes specially crafted MHTML (MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML) URLs.
- Specifically, the MHTML protocol handler does not properly validate the source of alternate content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-domain security bypass:** The MHTML handler incorrectly treats HTML content from one domain as if it were in the Local Machine Zone when it fails to access the specified MHTML file and tries to access the content specified by the alternate location.
- **MHTML URL processing flaw:** The way Outlook Express parses and handles MHTML URLs allows for the execution of arbitrary HTML code in the Local Machine security zone.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's system, with the privileges of the user running the program that invoked the handler (typically Internet Explorer).
- **Full System Control:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete control of the affected system, allowing the attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with administrative privileges.
- **Data Access:** An attacker can access files on the user's system.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) like behavior:** The vulnerability allows for accessing data in other websites as well as the local machine zone (e.g. read cookies/content)

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Web Sites:** An attacker can host a website containing a specially crafted web page to trigger the vulnerability. Users must be tricked into visiting the malicious site.
- **HTML Email:** An attacker can send a specially crafted HTML email that exploits the vulnerability when viewed by the victim.
- **Other programs:** Any program using the WebBrowser ActiveX control or the IE HTML rendering engine (MSHTML) may be affected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely via a web server or email.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to persuade users to either visit a malicious web page or open/view a malicious email.
- **Crafted URLs/HTML:** The attacker must be able to create specially crafted MHTML URLs and/or HTML content to exploit the flaw.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects various versions of Windows, including Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003.
- The vulnerability exists in Outlook Express 5.5 SP2, Outlook Express 6, and Outlook Express 6 SP1.
- The vulnerability can be exploited even if Outlook Express is not the default email reader.
- The vulnerability can be triggered through specially crafted MHTML URLs, which can be delivered through malicious websites or HTML email messages.
- Disabling Active Scripting or ActiveX controls is not a sufficient workaround.
- Microsoft released a security patch (MS04-013) to address the vulnerability.
