- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A format string vulnerability exists in Proxytunnel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The program improperly logs invalid proxy answers to syslog when started in daemon mode, which leads to a format string vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious remote server can send specially crafted invalid answers to exploit this format string vulnerability, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution on the tunneling host with the privileges of the Proxytunnel process.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious remote server sends specially crafted invalid proxy answers to the vulnerable Proxytunnel instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send data to the proxytunnel instance, acting as a malicious server. The proxytunnel process must be running in daemon mode with the -a [port] option.
