Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-0536:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A format string vulnerability exists in the `pipedmailmessage.cpp` file when Tripwire generates email reports. Specifically, the `fprintf` function is used with a user-controlled string without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The `fprintf` function in the `cPipedMailMessage::SendString` method directly uses a string from the heap (specifically, a filename) as its format string, without any format specifiers applied first. This allows an attacker to inject format specifiers like `%x`, `%n`, etc.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By crafting a filename containing format string specifiers, an attacker can cause `fprintf` to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations. This enables them to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Tripwire, typically root.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If tripwire is run by a privileged user (e.g. root) , a local unprivileged user can potentially gain root access to the machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local User Control:** A local user with the ability to create files with controlled filenames can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Email Report Generation:** The vulnerability is triggered when Tripwire generates an email report using the `-m c -M` flags (or similar).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs to have a local user account on the system where Tripwire is running.
- **File Creation:**  The attacker needs the ability to create a file with a name that contains the malicious format string specifiers.
- **Tripwire Email Reporting Enabled:** Tripwire must be configured to generate email reports for this vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional details:**
- The provided patch replaces `_ftprintf( mpFile, s.c_str() )` with `_ftprintf( mpFile, "%s", s.c_str() )`. This change ensures that the string is always treated as a literal string and not as a format string.
- The vulnerability affects Tripwire commercial versions <= 2.4 and open source versions <= 2.3.1
- The advisory mentions that Tripwire Inc. was notified and a fix was implemented, confirming the validity of the issue.
