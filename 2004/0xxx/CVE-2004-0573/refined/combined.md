How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#### WordPerfect 5.x Converter Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0573:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft WordPerfect 5.*x* Converter. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for WordPerfect 5.x Converter Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0573:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. A user must open an attachment this is sent in an e-mail message for an attack to be successful through e-mail.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
* This vulnerability does not affect WordPerfect 6.*x* documents, which are handled by a separate converter (wpft632.cnv).
* [Office 2003 Service Pack 1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=9c51d3a6-7cb1-4f61-837e-5f938254fc47&displaylang;=en) is not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for WordPerfect 5.x Converter Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0573:

* **Do not open WordPerfect 5.*x* documents using the affected WordPerfect 5.*x* Converter.**

  Do not open WordPerfect 5.*x* documents from untrusted sources using any software listed as affected in this bulletin on systems that are not updated with the security updates that accompany this bulletin.
* **Uninstall the WordPerfect 5.*x* Converter.**

  Uninstall the WordPerfect 5.*x* Converter from your system through **Add or Remove Programs**. Choose a program from the Affected Software list that is installed on your system and click **Change**. The WordPerfect 5.*x* Converter is an **Office Shared Feature**.

  **Impact of workaround:** Opening WordPerfect 5.*x* documents using any software listed in the Affected Software section would no longer be possible.
* **Use a third-party WordPerfect 5.*x* to Word converter or ask the user of WordPerfect to save the document in another format.**

#### FAQ for WordPerfect 5.x Converter Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0573:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the Office WordPerfect 5.x Converter.

**What is the Microsoft Office WordPerfect 5.*x* Converter?**

The Microsoft Office WordPerfect 5.*x* Converter helps users convert documents from Corel WordPerfect 5.*x* file formats to Microsoft Word file formats. The WordPerfect 5.*x* Converter is included in all versions of Office and is also available separately in the Office Converter Pack. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**What is the Microsoft Office Converter Pack?**

The Microsoft Office Converter Pack combines file converters and filters that were not included in earlier versions of Office. These converters and filters allow Office to use additional document formats that were not natively supported. The Office Converter Pack is available [as a Web download](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=34318).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take any action on a user's system that the user had permissions to carry out.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a malicious file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file. If the user opened the file, the application that used the WordPerfect 5.*x* Converter could fail and could allow the attacker to execute code of their choice.

**Can the vulnerability be exploited automatically through an e-mail message?**

No. A user must open a malicious document that an attacker provided in order for the vulnerability to be exploited. Viewing an e-mail message, even if Microsoft Word had been selected as the default e-mail editor for Microsoft Outlook, would not expose the vulnerability.

**Is the Microsoft Office WordPerfect 5.*x* Converter installed by default in all software listed in the "Affected Software" section of this bulletin?**

Yes. By default, the WordPerfect 5.*x* Converter is installed in all supported versions of the software listed in the Affected Software section of this bulletin. However, the user has the ability to not install the converter during the setup process.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers are only at risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative credentials are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the WordPerfect 5.*x* Converter validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.
