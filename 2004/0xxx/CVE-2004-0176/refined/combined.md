## Ethereal contains multiple vulnerabilities in the UCP protocol dissector

#### Vulnerability Note VU#125156

Original Release Date: 2004-03-25 | Last Revised: 2004-03-25

---

### Overview

Ethereal contains multiple buffer overflows in the Universal Control Protocol (UCP) protocol dissector. These vulnerabilities could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| Ethereal is a network traffic analysis package. It includes the ability to decode packets containing UCP data. There are three buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the way the UCP protocol dissector decodes packets containing UCP data. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by a remote, unauthenticated attacker by sending a specially crafted UCP packet containing an overly long string, integer, or time field value. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in arbitrary code execution.  According to the [e-matters Security Advisory](http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/032004.html):*To exploit this vulnerability over the wire an attacker must be able to fit more than BUFSIZ bytes into one TCP packet. This means it is only exploitable on the wire if the system has a MTU bigger than BUFSIZ. BUFSIZ is 8192 on glibc systems, 1024 on BSD systems and 512 on Windows systems.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  Upgrade to version 0.10.3 or later.Note: Ethereal is considered BETA software at this time. |
| --- |

| **Disable Dissector**If you are unable to upgrade to version 0.10.3 or later, you can disable the UCP protocol dissector by performing the following actions in Ethereal:(for Ethereal versions 0.9.x)1) Select Edit->Protocols2) Deselect the UCP protocol dissector from the list(for Ethereal versions 0.10.x)1) Select Analyze->Enabled Protocols2) Disable the UCP protocol dissector from the list by unchecking its "Status" checkbox |

#### Vulnerability Note VU#433596

Original Release Date: 2004-03-24 | Last Revised: 2004-03-25

---

### Overview

Ethereal fails to properly parse Pragmatic General Multicast ([PGM](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3208.txt)) packets containing a crafted negative acknowledgement (NAK) list.

### Description

| Ethereal is a network traffic analysis package. It includes the ability to decode packets containing PGM data. There is a vulnerability in the way the PGM protocol dissector parses PGM data containing a crafted NAK list.  According to the [e-matters Security Advisory](http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/032004.html):*"When parsing an PGM packet with a carefully crafted NakList a possible integer underflow can result in a very small stack-overflow. Due to the stacklayout code execution exploitation seems very unlikely."* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker could cause Ethereal to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  Upgrade to version 0.10.3 or later.Note: Ethereal is considered BETA software at this time. |
| --- |

| **Disable Dissector**If you are unable to upgrade to version 0.10.3 or later, you can disable the PGM protocol dissector by performing the following actions in Ethereal:(for Ethereal versions 0.8.x and 0.9.x)1) Select Edit->Protocols2) Deselect the PGM protocol dissector from the list(for Ethereal versions 0.10.x)1) Select Analyze->Enabled Protocols2) Disable the PGM protocol dissector from the list by unchecking its "Status" checkbox |

     Advisory: Multiple (13) Ethereal remote overflows
 Release Date: 2004/03/23
Last Modified: 2004/03/23
       Author: Stefan Esser [s.esser@e-matters.de]

  Application: Ethereal 0.8.14 - 0.10.2
     Severity: 13 remotely triggerable vulnerabilities were
               discovered in the multiprotocol packet sniffer
               Ethereal that allow remote compromise
         Risk: Critical
Vendor Status: Plans to release a fixed version within this week
    Reference: <http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/032004.html>

Overview:

   Quote from <http://www.ethereal.com>

   "Ethereal is used by network professionals around the world for
   troubleshooting, analysis, software and protocol development, and
   education. It has all of the standard features you would expect in
   a protocol analyzer, and several features not seen in any other
   product. Its open source license allows talented experts in the
   networking community to add enhancements. It runs on all popular
   computing platforms, including Unix, Linux, and Windows."

   During a code audit of Ethereal thirteen remotely triggerable stack-
   overflows where discovered. The vulnerable dissectors in question
   are namely: BGP, EIGRP, IGAP, IRDA, ISUP, NetFlow, PGM, TCAP and UCP.

   With the exception of 3 all discovered overflows allow arbitrary code
   execution by injecting carefully crafted packets to the sniffed wire
   or by convincing someone to load a malicious packet capture file into
   Ethereal.

Details:

   In the beginning of March a code audit of Ethereal revealed remotely
   triggerable overflows within a few of the over 400 dissectors. During
   the process of working with the Ethereal vendor the audit continued
   and until today it was possible to identify a total count of 13
   possible stack overflows within 9 different dissectors.

   For the purpose of clarity it was choosen to describe all these bugs
   within this advisory instead of spreading the information over nine
   single advisories.

   Because the defects affect different parts of the code base and
   were introduced at different dates within the last 3 years the
   following table gives a short overview of the exact CVS commit
   timestamps and the version number it first appeared in.

   In the following paragraphs all 13 bugs are described in a
   short form. The referenced URL within the header of this advisory
   will be updated with more detailed information (incl. snippets)
   when the Ethereal developers have released 0.10.3.

   [[01]](#01) NetFlow v9 Dissector Template Caching Overflow
   ---------------------------------------------------

   Desc: When parsing the v9_template structure within a NetFlow
         UDP packet a template_entry count > 64 will overflow
         a stackbuffer and allows overwriting the saved instruction
         pointer, thus allowing remote code execution.

   [[02]](#02) IGAP Protocol Dissector Account Overflow
   [[03]](#03) IGAP Protocol Dissector Message Overflow
   ---------------------------------------------

   Desc: When parsing an IGAP protocol packet that contains either
         an overlong accountname (>17) or an overlong message (>65)
         different buffers may overflow the stack, allowing an over-
         write of up to 238 (or 190) bytes. In both cases remote
         code execution exploitation is possible.

   [[04]](#04) EIGRP Protocol TLV_IP_INT Long IP Address Overflow
   -------------------------------------------------------

   Desc: When parsing an EIGRP IP packet that contains an overlong
         IP address this will overflow a stack buffer and therefore can
         lead to remote code execution

   [[05]](#05) EIGRP Protocol TLV_IP_EXT Long IP Address Overflow
   -------------------------------------------------------

   Desc: When parsing an EIGRP Extended IP packet that contains an
         overlong extended IP address this will overflow a stack buffer
         and can lead to remote code execution

   [[06]](#06) PGM Protocol NakList Overflow
   ----------------------------------

   Desc: When parsing an PGM packet with a carefully crafted NakList
         a possible integer underflow can result in a very small stack-
         overflow. Due to the stacklayout code execution exploitation
         seems very unlikely.

   [[07]](#07) IRDA Protocol Plugin IRCOM_PORT_NAME Overflow
   --------------------------------------------------

   Desc: When parsing an IRCOM_PORT_NAME packed an overlong portname
         can overwrite up to 2 bytes on the stack. Similar to [[06]](#06) the
         stacklayout seems to make remote code execution very difficult
         or impossible.

   [[08]](#08) BGP Protocol MPLS Label Overflow
   -------------------------------------

   Desc: When parsing a BGP Packet with a MPLS IPv6 label up to 13
         bytes on the stack may be overwritten with arbitrary data.
         Due to the stacklayout exploitability seems unlikly and was
         therefore not tested.

   [[09]](#09) ISUP Protocol INTERWORKING FUNCTION ADDRESS Overflow
   ---------------------------------------------------------

   Desc: When parsing an ISUP Packet an oversized IWFA will overflow
         a stack buffer and can lead to remote code execution

   [[10]](#10) TCAP Protocol TID Overflow
   -------------------------------

   Desc: When handling the ASN.1 encoded Transaction ID within a TCAP
         packet a 4 byte stack variable may overflow and can lead to
         remote code execution

   [[11]](#11) UCP Protocol Handle String-Field Overflow
   ----------------------------------------------

   Desc: When handling a string within an UCP packet a stack buffer
         of BUFSIZ bytes may overflow and can therefore lead to
         remote code execution.
         To exploit this vulnerability over the wire an attacker must
         be able to fit more than BUFSIZ bytes into one TCP packet.
         This means it is only exploitable on the wire if the system
         has a MTU bigger than BUFSIZ. BUFSIZ is 8192 on glibc
         systems, 1024 on BSD systems and 512 on Windows systems.

   [[12]](#12) UCP Protocol Handle Int-Field Overflow
   ----------------------------------------------

   Desc: When handling an Integer field within an UCP packet a stack
         buffer of BUFSIZ bytes may overflow and can therfore lead to
         remote code execution.
         To exploit this vulnerability over the wire an attacker must
         be able to fit more than BUFSIZ bytes into one TCP packet.
         This means it is only exploitable on the wire if the system
         has a MTU bigger than BUFSIZ. BUFSIZ is 8192 on glibc
         systems, 1024 on BSD systems and 512 on Windows systems.

   [[13]](#13) UCP Protocol Handle Time-Field Overflow
   ----------------------------------------------

   Desc: When handling a Time field within an UCP packet a stack
         buffer of BUFSIZ bytes may overflow and can therefore lead
         to remote code execution.
         To exploit this vulnerability over the wire an attacker must
         be able to fit more than BUFSIZ bytes into one TCP packet.
         This means it is only exploitable on the wire if the system
         has a MTU bigger than BUFSIZ. BUFSIZ is 8192 on glibc
         systems, 1024 on BSD systems and 512 on Windows systems.

Proof of Concept:

   e-matters is not going to release an exploit for any of these
   vulnerabilities to the public.

Disclosure Timeline:

    5. March 2004 - Ethereal developers were contacted by email
                    telling them about 10(of the 13) holes.
                    6 holes were closed the same day EIGRP, IGAP,
                    ISUP and BGP.
    7. March 2004 - IRDA hole closed (after checking specs)
    8. March 2004 - PGM hole closed (after checking specs)
    9. March 2004 - NetFlow hole closed (after checking specs)
   17. March 2004 - UCP holes were discovered and mailed to vendor
   19. March 2004 - UCP and TCAP holes closed (after checking specs)
   22. March 2004 - Ethereal developers have releases a mini advisory
                    urging their users to upgrade to version 0.10.3
                    which will be released later this week
   23. March 2004 - Public Disclosure

CVE Information:

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
   assigned the name CAN-2004-0176 to this issue.

Recommendation:

   Until you can upgrade to version 0.10.3 of Ethereal or to the
   bugfixed package from your distributor it is strongly recommended
   to disable the following dissectors in the menu:

   Analyze->Enabled Protocols

   disable: BGP, EIGRP, IGAP, IRDA, ISUP, NetFlow, PGM, TCAP, UCP

# Multiple remote overflows and vulnerabilities in Ethereal — GLSA **200403-07**

Mulitple overflows and vulnerabilities exist in Ethereal which may allow an
attacker to crash the program or run arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/ethereal** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.10.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.10.3** |

### Background

Quote from http://www.ethereal.com

"Ethereal is used by network professionals around the world for
troubleshooting, analysis, software and protocol development, and
education. It has all of the standard features you would expect in a
protocol analyzer, and several features not seen in any other product. Its
open source license allows talented experts in the networking community to
add enhancements. It runs on all popular computing platforms, including
Unix, Linux, and Windows."

________________________________________________________________________

Package:             ethereal
Vulnerability:       arbitrary code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= ethereal-0.10.2-20040329 >= ethereal-0.10.3-20040330
OpenPKG 2.0          <= ethereal-0.10.0a-2.0.0   >= ethereal-0.10.0a-2.0.1
OpenPKG 1.3          <= ethereal-0.9.14-1.3.0    >= ethereal-0.9.14-1.3.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a vendor security advisory [[0]](#0) based on hints from Stefan
  Esser and Jonathan Heussser, several vulnerabilities of various types
  exist in the Ethereal network protocol analyzer [[1]](#1). Namely, it may be
  possible to make Ethereal crash or run arbitrary code by injecting a
  purposefully malformed packet onto the wire, by convincing someone to
  read a malformed packet trace file, or by creating a malformed color
  filter file.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the
  identifiers CAN-2004-0176 [[2]](#2) and CAN-2004-0365 [[3]](#3) to the problems
  concerning protocol dissectors and RADIUS packets.

  The zero-length presentation protocol selector vulnerability named in
  the Ethereal vendor advisory does not affect OpenPKG though, because
  such presentation protocol selectors are not implemented in any
  Ethereal versions released by OpenPKG.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
  -q ethereal". If you have the "ethereal" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution) [4][[5]](#5).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [6][[7]](#7), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [8][[9]](#9) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[10]](#10), build a corresponding binary
  RPM from it [[4]](#4) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [[5]](#5). For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.0, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.0/UPD
  ftp> get ethereal-0.10.0a-2.0.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig ethereal-0.10.0a-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild ethereal-0.10.0a-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ su -

## Ethereal fails to properly decode Transaction IDs within TCAP packets

#### Vulnerability Note VU#591820

Original Release Date: 2004-03-25 | Last Revised: 2004-03-25

---

### Overview

Ethereal contains a vulnerability in the way the Transaction Capabilities Application Part ([TCAP](http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/99nov/I-D/draft-ietf-sigtran-tcap-perf-req-00.txt)) protocol dissector parses ASN.1 encoded Transaction IDs within TCAP packets.

### Description

| Ethereal is a network traffic analysis package. It includes the ability to decode packets containing TCAP data. The TCAP protocol is designed to enable advanced network telephony services between signaling points. For instance, when dialing an 800, 888, or 900 number, TCAP is used to determine the routing numbers for these digits.  According to an [IETF Draft](http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/99nov/I-D/draft-ietf-sigtran-tcap-perf-req-00.txt), *TCAP messages are designed for accessing databases or other switches to retrieve information or invoke features. TCAP enables the deployment of advanced intelligent network services by supporting non-circuit related information exchange between signaling points using the signaling connection control part (SCCP) connectionless service for message transport.**...**The Transaction ID is a reference to correlate messages\twithin the same transaction and associate the TCAP transaction with a specific application at the originating and destination signaling points.*There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the way the TCAP protocol dissector parses ASN.1 encoded Transaction IDs within TCAP packets. Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for arbitrary code execution. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**Upgrade to version 0.10.3 or later.Note: Ethereal is considered BETA software at this time. |
| --- |

| **Disable Dissector**If you are unable to upgrade to version 0.10.3 or later, you can disable the TCAP protocol dissector by performing the following actions in Ethereal:(for Ethereal versions 0.9.x)1) Select Edit->Protocols2) Deselect the TCAP protocol dissector from the list(for Ethereal versions 0.10.x)1) Select Analyze->Enabled Protocols2) Disable the TCAP protocol dissector from the list by unchecking its "Status" checkbox |

## Ethereal fails to properly parse NetFlow UDP packets with an overly large template\_entry count

#### Vulnerability Note VU#644886

Original Release Date: 2004-03-24 | Last Revised: 2004-03-25

---

### Overview

Ethereal fails to properly parse v9\_template structures in NetFlow UDP packets with an overly large template\_entry count. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| Ethereal is a network traffic analysis package. It includes the ability to decode packets containing NetFlow data. There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the way the NetFlow v9 dissector parses v9\_template structures in a NetFlow UDP packet. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a NetFlow UDP packet containing an overly large template\_entry count which could allow for arbitrary code execution. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  Upgrade to version 0.10.3 or later.Note: Ethereal is considered BETA software at this time. |
| --- |

| **Disable Dissector**If you are unable to upgrade to version 0.10.3 or later, you can disable the NetFlow protocol dissector by performing the following actions in Ethereal:(for Ethereal versions 0.9.x)1) Select Edit->Protocols2) Deselect the NetFlow protocol dissector from the list(for Ethereal versions 0.10.x)1) Select Analyze->Enabled Protocols2) Disable the CFLOW (Cisco NetFlow) protocol dissector from the list by unchecking its "Status" checkboxHowever, it is strongly encouraged to upgrade to version 0.10.3 or later. |

## Ethereal fails to properly decode BGP packets containing MPLS IPv6 labels

#### Vulnerability Note VU#931588

Original Release Date: 2004-03-25 | Last Revised: 2004-03-25

---

### Overview

Ethereal contains a vulnerability in the way the Border Gateway Protocol ([BGP](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1771.txt)) protocol dissector decodes Multiprotocol Label Switching ([MPLS](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3031.txt)) IPv6 labels.

### Description

| Ethereal is a network traffic analysis package. It includes the ability to decode packets containing BGP data. According to [RFC3031](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3031.txt), an MPLS label is an identifier used to represent the Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) to which that packet is assigned. There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the way the BGP protocol dissector decodes MPLS IPv6 labels.  According to the [e-matters Security Advisory](http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/032004.html):*When parsing a BGP Packet with a MPLS IPv6 label up to 13 bytes on the stack may be overwritten with arbitrary data. Due to the stacklayout exploitability seems unlikly and was therefore not tested.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker could cause Ethereal to crash or potentially execute code of the attacker's choice. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  Upgrade to version 0.10.3 or later.Note: Ethereal is considered BETA software at this time. |
| --- |

| **Disable Dissector**If you are unable to upgrade to version 0.10.3 or later, you can disable the BGP protocol dissector by performing the following actions in Ethereal:(for Ethereal versions 0.8.x and 0.9.x)1) Select Edit->Protocols2) Deselect the BGP protocol dissector from the list(for Ethereal versions 0.10.x)1) Select Analyze->Enabled Protocols2) Disable the BGP protocol dissector from the list by unchecking its "Status" checkboxHowever, it is strongly encouraged to upgrade to version 0.10.3 or later. |
