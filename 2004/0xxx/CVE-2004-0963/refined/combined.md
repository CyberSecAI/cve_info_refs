### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves two newly-discovered vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word that could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on a users system. The vulnerabilities are documented in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin.

If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Buffer Overrun in Microsoft Word CAN-2004-0963:

A vulnerability exists in Microsoft Word that could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on a users system.

If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges.

Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

#### Mitigating Factors for Buffer Overrun in Microsoft Word - CAN-2004-0963:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

#### Workarounds for Buffer Overrun in Microsoft Word CAN-2004-0963:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* Do not open Microsoft Word documents from unknown or untrusted sources.
* Enable prompting for Office documents so that they will not auto-open.

  **Note** By default, Internet Explorer will prompt the user to Open/Save As the document. However, if this functionality has been turned off, the documents will automatically be opened. To re-enable this functionality:

  1. Go to **My Computer** and click on **Tools**, then click **Folder Options**.
  2. Select the **File Types** tab
  3. For each Office file type, highlight and click **Advanced**
  4. Verify that the **Confirm open after download** setting is checked
  5. Uncheck the setting to **Browse in same Window**
  6. Select **Ok** and **Close**

  **Impact of Workaround:**

  Microsoft Office will now prompt the user to Open/Save As instead of allowing for malicious code to automatically be run.

#### FAQ for Buffer Overrun in Word - CAN-2004-0963:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [buffer overrun](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21141) vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and to perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, see the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, see the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

MS Word multiple exceptions, at least one exploitable.

Classification:
===============
Level: low-MED-[high]-crit
ID: HEXVIEW*2004*10*06*1

Overview:
=========
MS Word is a highly overrated and widely used text processor, a part of
monstrous collection of applications and de-facto platform for virus and
worm replication known as MS Office suite.

Affected products:
==================
All tests were performed using MS Word 2002 (10.6612.6714) SP3 with all
the latest patches installed.

Cause and Effect:
=================
Sufficient data validation is not performed when winword.exe parses the
document file. As a result, it is possible to trigger an exception by
modifying data within *.doc file.

There are two exception types, one is triggered when winword.exe
tries to read from invalid memory region using offset value taken from the
document file. This exception is not exploitable.

The second exception is more interesting and most likely exploitable.
It is triggered by signed word->dword expansion that is later placed in
ECX, shifted right twice, and used as counter value for MOVSD instruction.
I.e. winword.exe code tried to copy nearly 4GB of RAM.

Demonstration:
==============
Below is a fragment of an empty *.doc file. Note the sequence of 0xAA characters
on line #3. When MS Word parsed this part of file, an exceptions occurs.
It is possible to trigger two other "access violation" conditions by modifying
data represented on lines #2 and #3.
