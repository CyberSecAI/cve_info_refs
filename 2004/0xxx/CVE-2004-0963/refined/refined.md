Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2004-0963:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an unchecked buffer within Microsoft Word. Specifically, the document parsing process fails to properly validate the length of data before passing it to an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow. When parsing a specially crafted document, the program copies data into a buffer without properly checking if the data exceeds the buffer's capacity, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** If the user is logged in with administrative privileges, the attacker gains full control of the system, potentially leading to the following:
    *   Installing programs
    *   Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    *   Creating new accounts with full privileges.
* Users with limited privileges are at lower risk, as the attacker gains only the user's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Document:** The attacker creates a malicious document file containing code designed to trigger the buffer overflow.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince the victim to open the malicious document. This could be done through email or by hosting it on a network share or website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious Document:** The attacker needs the technical capability to create a Microsoft Word document with specific formatting or content to exploit the buffer overflow.
*   **Ability to deliver malicious document:** The attacker must be able to send the document to the user or host the document where the user would access it.
*   **User Interaction**: The attacker relies on the user opening the document.

**Additional Information from the Provided Content:**

*   **Public Disclosure:** The vulnerability had been publicly disclosed prior to the security bulletin release.
*   **Proof-of-Concept:** Proof-of-concept code demonstrating the vulnerability was publicly available, but no actual attacks had been reported at the time of the bulletin's release.
*  **Vulnerable software:** Microsoft Word 2000, 2002, 2003 and Microsoft Word 2003 Viewer are vulnerable to this issue. Microsoft Works Suite is also affected since it contains Microsoft Word.

This vulnerability is addressed by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-023.
