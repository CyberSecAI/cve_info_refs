RHSA-2004:090 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2004-02-26
Updated:
2004-02-26
# RHSA-2004:090 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

libxml2 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Updated libxml2 packages that fix an overflow when parsing remote resources
are now available.

## Description

libxml2 is a library for manipulating XML files.

Yuuichi Teranishi discovered a flaw in libxml2 versions prior to 2.6.6.
When fetching a remote resource via FTP or HTTP, libxml2 uses special
parsing routines. These routines can overflow a buffer if passed a very
long URL. If an attacker is able to find an application using libxml2 that
parses remote resources and allows them to influence the URL, then this
flaw could be used to execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0110
to this issue.

All users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported fix and are not vulnerable to this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade. Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated. Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated. Note that you
can also use wildcards (\*.rpm) if your current directory \*only\* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network. Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate. The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt>

Description:
  A flaw in the HTTP and FTP client sub-library of libxml2 [[0]](#0)
  found by Yuuichi Teranishi can be exploited to cause a buffer
  overflow if passed a very long URL [[1]](#1). This could be used by
  an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host computer. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2004-0110 [[2]](#2) to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  libxml". If you have the "libxml" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see solution) and any dependent packages (see above). [3][[4]](#4)

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [[5]](#5), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [[6]](#6) or a mirror location,
  verify its integrity [[7]](#7), build a corresponding binary RPM from it [[3]](#3)
  and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary RPM [[4]](#4).
  For the affected release OpenPKG 1.3, perform the following operations
  to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases adjust
  accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.3/UPD
  ftp> get libxml-2.5.8-1.3.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig libxml-2.5.8-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild libxml-2.5.8-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/libxml-2.5.8-1.3.1.*.rpm

  Additionally, we recommend that you rebuild and reinstall
  all dependent packages (see above), if any, too. [3][[4]](#4)

# Libxml2 URI Parsing Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities — GLSA **200403-01**

A buffer overflow has been discovered in libxml2 versions prior to
2.6.6 which may be exploited by an attacker allowing the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/libxml2** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.6.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.6.6** |

### Background

### Description

Yuuichi Teranishi discovered a flaw in libxml2 versions prior to 2.6.6.
When the libxml2 library fetches a remote resource via FTP or HTTP, libxml2
uses parsing routines that can overflow a buffer caused by improper bounds
checking if they are passed a URL longer than 4096 bytes.

### Impact

If an attacker is able to exploit an application using libxml2 that parses
remote resources, then this flaw could be used to execute arbitrary code.

### Workaround

No workaround is available; users are urged to upgrade libxml2 to 2.6.6.

### Resolution

All users are recommended to upgrade their libxml2 installation:

```
 # emerge sync
 # emerge -pv ">=dev-libs/libxml2-2.6.6"
 # emerge ">=dev-libs/libxml2-2.6.6"
```

## Libxml2 URI parsing errors in nanohttp and nanoftp

#### Vulnerability Note VU#493966

Original Release Date: 2004-03-09 | Last Revised: 2004-03-09

---

### Overview

[Libxml](http://www.xmlsoft.org/) is the XML parser for [Gnome](http://www.gnome.org/), a desktop suite and development platform for Linux systems. Libxml2, the latest version of the library as of this writing, has a buffer overflow vulnerability which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Description

| [Gnome](http://www.gnome.org/), a desktop suite and development platform for Linux systems, uses [Libxml](http://www.xmlsoft.org/) as an XML parser to handle encoding and decoding or URI strings (this is part of the GNOME XML Toolkit). The Libxml2 release of Libxml prior to version 2.6.6 (published Feb 12 2004) contains a buffer overflow vulnerability when parsing URI strings in XML-structrued files. If the URI is over 4096 bytes, it may be possible to crash software using a vulnerable version of Libxml2. |
| --- |

### Impact

| The complete impact of this vulnerability is not yet known. It is reported to cause a SEGV in software using a vulnerable version of Libxml2. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Update to Libxml2 version 2.6.6 or later at <http://www.xmlsoft.org/downloads.html> |
| --- |

Debian Security Advisory DSA 455-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : libxml, libxml2
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0110

libxml2 is a library for manipulating XML files.

Yuuichi Teranishi discovered a flaw in libxml, the GNOME XML library.
When fetching a remote resource via FTP or HTTP, the library uses
special parsing routines which can overflow a buffer if passed a very
long URL.  If an attacker is able to find an application using libxml1
or libxml2 that parses remote resources and allows the attacker to
craft the URL, then this flaw could be used to execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.17-2woody1 of libxml and version 2.4.19-4woody1 of libxml2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.17-5 of libxml and version 2.6.6-1 of libxml2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxml1 and libxml2 packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

~      Bugs: #42735
~        ID: 200403-01

Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow has been discovered in libxml2 versions prior to
2.6.6 which may be exploited by an attacker allowing the execution of
arbitrary code.

Description
===========

Yuuichi Teranishi discovered a flaw in libxml2 versions prior to 2.6.6.
When the libxml2 library fetches a remote resource via FTP or HTTP,
libxml2 uses parsing routines that can overflow a buffer caused by
improper bounds checking if they are passed a URL longer than 4096
bytes.

Impact
======

If an attacker is able to exploit an application using libxml2 that
parses remote resources, then this flaw could be used to execute
arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

No workaround is available; users are urged to upgrade libxml2 to
2.6.6.

Resolution
==========

All users are recommended to upgrade their libxml2 installation:

~    # emerge sync
~    # emerge -pv ">=dev-libs/libxml2-2.6.6"
~    # emerge ">=dev-libs/libxml2-2.6.6"

Description:
  A flaw in the HTTP and FTP client sub-library of libxml2 [0]
  found by Yuuichi Teranishi can be exploited to cause a buffer
  overflow if passed a very long URL [1]. This could be used by
  an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host computer. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2004-0110 [2] to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  libxml". If you have the "libxml" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see solution) and any dependent packages (see above). [3][4]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [6] or a mirror location,
  verify its integrity [7], build a corresponding binary RPM from it [3]
  and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary RPM [4].
  For the affected release OpenPKG 1.3, perform the following operations
  to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases adjust
  accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.3/UPD
  ftp> get libxml-2.5.8-1.3.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig libxml-2.5.8-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild libxml-2.5.8-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/libxml-2.5.8-1.3.1.\*.rpm

  Additionally, we recommend that you rebuild and reinstall
  all dependent packages (see above), if any, too. [3][4]

 Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis: Updated libxml2 packages fix security vulnerability
Advisory ID: RHSA-2004:091-02
Issue date: 2004-03-03
Updated on: 2004-03-03
Product: Red Hat Linux
Keywords:
Cross references:
Obsoletes:
CVE Names: CAN-2004-0110
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated libxml2 packages that fix an overflow when parsing remote resources
are now available.

[Updated 3 March 2004]
Revised libxml2 packages are now available as the original packages did not
contain a complete patch.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

libxml2 is a library for manipulating XML files.

Yuuichi Teranishi discovered a flaw in libxml2 versions prior to 2.6.6.
When fetching a remote resource via FTP or HTTP, libxml2 uses special
parsing routines. These routines can overflow a buffer if passed a very
long URL. If an attacker is able to find an application using libxml2 that
parses remote resources and allows them to influence the URL, then this
flaw could be used to execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0110
to this issue.

All users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported fix and are not vulnerable to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade. Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated. Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated. Note that you
can also use wildcards (\*.rpm) if your current directory \*only\* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network. Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate. The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt>

5. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/libxml2-2.5.4-3.rh9.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/libxml2-2.5.4-3.rh9.i386.rpm
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/libxml2-devel-2.5.4-3.rh9.i386.rpm
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/libxml2-python-2.5.4-3.rh9.i386.rpm

6. Verification:

MD5 sum Package Name

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security. Our key is
available from <https://www.redhat.com/security/keys.html>

You can verify each package with the following command:

 rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:

 md5sum <filename>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
