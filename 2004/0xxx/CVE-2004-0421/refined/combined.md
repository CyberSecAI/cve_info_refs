Description:
  Steve Grubb discovered that the Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
  library libpng [[1]](#1) accesses memory that is out of bounds when creating
  an error message. Depending on machine architecture, bounds checking
  and other protective measures, this problem could cause the program
  to crash if a defective or intentionally prepared PNG image file is
  handled by libpng. This can even lead to a Denial of Service (DoS)
  situation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project
  assigned the id CAN-2004-0421 [[2]](#2) to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
  -q png" (and similarly for the other affected packages which have
  PNG included). If you have the "png" package (or one of the others)
  installed and its version is affected (see above), we recommend that
  you immediately upgrade it (see Solution) and its dependent packages
  (see above), if any, too [3][[4]](#4).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][[6]](#6), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][[8]](#8) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[9]](#9), build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [[3]](#3) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [[4]](#4). For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.0, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.0/UPD
  ftp> get png-1.2.5-2.0.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig png-1.2.5-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild png-1.2.5-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/png-1.2.5-2.0.1.*.rpm

  Additionally, we recommend that you rebuild and reinstall
  all dependent packages (see above), if any, too [3][[4]](#4).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2004-0025

Package name:      libpng proftpd
Summary:           Potential security holes
Date:              2004-04-30
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.0
                   Trustix Secure Linux 2.1
                   Trustix Secure Enterprise Linux 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:

  libpng:
  A library of functions for creating and manipulating PNG
  (Portable Network Graphics) image format files.

  proftpd:
  An enhanced FTP server with a focus toward simplicity, security,
  and ease of configuration.  It features a very Apache-like configuration
  syntax, and a highly customizable server infrastructure, including
  support for multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and
  permission-based directory visibility.

Problem description:

  libpng:
  Steve Grubb discovered that libpng would access memory that is out of
  bounds when creating an error message. The impact of this bug is not
  clear, but it could lead to a core dump in a program using libpng, or
  could result in a DoS (Denial of Service) condition in a daemon that
  uses libpng to process PNG images.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2004-0421 to this issue.

  proftpd:
  A portability workaround was applied in version 1.2.9 of the FTP
  server ProFTPD. As a side-effect, CIDR based (aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd/NN)
  ACL entries in "Allow" and "Deny" directives act like a "AllowAll"
  directive and so FTP clients are granted access to files and
  directories although the server configuration explicitly deny this
  access.

  This issue only affects proftpd 1.2.9, which is shipped with Trustix
  Secure Linux 2.1 and Trustix Secure Enterprise Linux 2.  Trustix Secure
  Linux 2.0 uses proftpd 1.2.8, and is NOT affected by this issue.

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
  package, you may want to remove it from your system.

Location:
  All Trustix Secure Linux updates are available from
  <URI:<http://http.trustix.org/pub/trustix/updates/>>
  <URI:ftp://ftp.trustix.org/pub/trustix/updates/>

About Trustix Secure Linux:
  Trustix Secure Linux is a small Linux distribution for servers. With focus
  on security and stability, the system is painlessly kept safe and up to
  date from day one using swup, the automated software updater.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2004-105
2004-05-05
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Name        : libpng
Version     : 1.2.2
Release     : 20
Summary     : A library of functions for manipulating PNG image format
files.
Description :
The libpng package contains a library of functions for creating and
manipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format files.  PNG
is a bit-mapped graphics format similar to the GIF format.  PNG was
created to replace the GIF format, since GIF uses a patented data
compression algorithm.

Libpng should be installed if you need to manipulate PNG format image
files.
