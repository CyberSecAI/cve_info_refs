Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in the web-based management interface of Brightmail Spamfilter 6.0. The application uses a predictable URL structure, where the `id` parameter in the `viewMsgDetails.do` endpoint is used to access quarantined spam emails.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The application allows direct access to quarantined emails by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL. This parameter is not properly validated against the user's permissions.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability allows access to other users' spam emails without proper authentication or authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker, even with limited access to the control center, can view and potentially extract sensitive information from spam emails belonging to other users or domains within the Brightmail system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through manipulation of the URL used to access quarantined emails in the Brightmail control center. Specifically, altering the numerical values in the `id` parameter of the `viewMsgDetails.do` endpoint:
`http://SERVER:41080/brightmail/quarantine/viewMsgDetails.do?id=QMsgView-3;3-0`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have authorized access to the Brightmail Control Center.
- Basic knowledge of web application URL structure and manipulation is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was confirmed in Brightmail Spamfilter 6.0.0.100 and previous beta versions.
- Symantec acknowledged the issue and provided a fix to authorized customers.
- The risk is considered low as it requires authorized access to the control center.
