Symantec Brightmail Anti-Spam Unauthorized Filtered Mail Access - BID

Risk

Low

Overview

An issue with Symantec's Brightmail Anti-Spam 6.0 was posted to the
SecurityFocus Bugtraq mailing list concerning unauthorized access to
filtered emails through manipulation of
queries to the web-based Contol Center.

Components Affected

Symantec Brightmail Anti-Spam 6.0

Description

Symantec is aware of a recent posting,
<http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/367866> , concerning unauthorized
access to filtered spam emails in Symantec Brightmail Anti-Spam 6.0.
Symantec Brightmail Anti-Spam 6.0 is a high performance software solution
that blocks spam at the Internet gateway.  Brightmail Anti-Spam 6.0
provides an access-restricted
web-based Control Center for administration and management of Symantec
Brightmail Anti-Spam servers.

Users with authorized access to the Control Center can review the spam
emails that are being filtered and quarantined.  However, according to the
poster, by modifying the query to the
Control Center, the user could potentially gain access to filtered spam
emails of other domains or users that they may not be authorized to
access.

Symantec Response

Symantec engineers confirmed that by properly manipulating the Quarantine
URL within Control Center, a user, although authorized access to the
Control Center, could gain access to
filtered spam emails on the Control Center server that they were possibly
not authorized to view.

Symantec takes the proper functionality of our products seriously.
Although it presents a low-level security concern, anyone who has access
to the Control Center should be an
authorized administrator, Symantec Brightmail has addressed this  issue in
a fix available to authorized customers through the support download site,
<http://support.brightmail.com>.
Symantec recommends customers who have not already applied this update, do
so to alleviate any concerns from this issue.
