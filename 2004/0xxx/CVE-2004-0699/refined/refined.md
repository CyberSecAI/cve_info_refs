Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2004-0699

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow exists in an ASN.1 decoding library used by Check Point VPN-1 products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerability within the ASN.1 decoding process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can potentially compromise the VPN gateway system. This could lead to complete system compromise, unauthorized access, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited during the IKE (Internet Key Exchange) negotiation process when establishing a new VPN connection.
- The attacker initiates an IKE negotiation and sends a malformed (specially crafted) IKE packet to trigger the buffer overflow.
- If Aggressive Mode IKE is used, this vulnerability can be exploited with a single packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to initiate an IKE negotiation with the vulnerable Check Point VPN-1 system.
- The attacker needs to be able to create and send a malformed IKE packet.
- The exploit packet is encrypted, which prevents simple detection by using a signature-based approach.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Mark Dowd and Neel Mehta of ISS X-Force.
- The vulnerability affects multiple Check Point products including VPN-1/FireWall-1 NG with Application Intelligence R54, R55, R55W, VPN-1/FireWall-1 Next Generation FP3, VPN-1/FireWall-1 VSX FireWall-1 GX, and VPN-1 SecuRemote/SecureClient.
- Check Point has released patches to address the vulnerability, and users are advised to apply these fixes to mitigate the risk.
