How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Description:
  During a source code audit, Chris Evans discovered several problems in
  the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) library libpng [[1]](#1), some of which
  are security relevant. This OpenPKG update fixes all known issues.

  A stack-based buffer overflow in libpng which can be triggered to run
  arbitrary code by a malicious png file. The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2004-0597 [[2]](#2) to the
  problem.

  A NULL-pointer crash in libpng which can be triggered by a malicious
  png file. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project
  assigned the id CAN-2004-0598 [[3]](#3) to the problem.

  Various possible integer overflows in libpng which may have security
  consequences. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project
  assigned the id CAN-2004-0599 [[4]](#4) to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/openpkg
  rpm -q png". If you have the "png" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution) and its dependent packages (see above), if any, too
  [5][[6]](#6).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [7][[8]](#8), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [9][[10]](#10) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[11]](#11), build a corresponding binary
  RPM from it [[5]](#5) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [[6]](#6). For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.1, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.1/UPD
  ftp> get png-1.2.5-2.1.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig png-1.2.5-2.1.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild png-1.2.5-2.1.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/png-1.2.5-2.1.1.*.rpm

  Additionally, we recommend that you rebuild and reinstall
  all dependent packages (see above), if any, too [5][[6]](#6).

CESA-2004-001 - rev 4
[See all my vulnerabilities at http://scary.beasts.org/security]
libPNG 1.2.5 stack-based buffer overflow and other code concerns
================================================================
Programs : libpng users including mozilla, konqueror, various e-mail
clients, generally lots. Also reports that some versions of
IE are vulnerable to some of the problems.
Severity : - A malicious website serving a malicious PNG file could
compromise the browsers of visitors.
- A malicious PNG could be sent via e-mail and compromise
the e-mail viewer of the recipient.
- For systems with user-providable images for "face
browsers", a local system compromise could be possible via
a malicious PNG.
CAN identifier(s): CAN-2004-0597 (the serious one), CAN-2004-0598,
CAN-2004-0599
CERT VU#s : VU#388984 (the serious one), VU#236656, VU#160448,
VU#477512, VU#817368, VU#286464
This advisory lists code flaws discovered by inspection of the libpng-1.2.5
code. Only the first one has been examined in practice to confirm
exploitability. The other flaws certainly warrant fixing.
A patch which should plug all these issues is appended beneath the advisory.
NOTE! This patch serves as demo purposes for the flaws only. An official
v1.2.6 libpng with an official, slightly different fix will be released by
the libpng team in parallel with this advisory.
1) Remotely exploitable stack-based buffer overrun in png\_handle\_tRNS
(pngrutil.c)
If a PNG file is of the correct format, a length check on PNG data is missed
prior to filling a buffer on the stack from the PNG data. The exact flaw would
seem to be a logic error; failure to bail out of a function after a warning
condition is hit, here:
if (!(png\_ptr->mode & PNG\_HAVE\_PLTE))
{
/\* Should be an error, but we can cope with it \*/
png\_warning(png\_ptr, "Missing PLTE before tRNS");
}
else if (length > (png\_uint\_32)png\_ptr->num\_palette)
{
png\_warning(png\_ptr, "Incorrect tRNS chunk length");
png\_crc\_finish(png\_ptr, length);
return;
}
We can see, if the first warning condition is hit, the length check is missed
due to the use of an "else if".
A PNG crafted to trip this is available at
http://scary.beasts.org/misc/pngtest\_bad.png
It crashes both mozilla and konqueror.
A scarier possibility is targetted exploitation by e-mailing a nasty PNG to
someone who uses a graphical e-mail client to decode PNGs with a vulnerable
libpng.
2) Dangerous code in png\_handle\_sBIT (pngrutil.c) (Similar code in
png\_handle\_hIST).
Although seemingly not exploitable, there is dangerous code in this function.
It relies on checks scattered elsewhere in the code in order to not overflow
a 4-byte stack buffer. This line here should upper-bound the read onto the
stack to 4 bytes:
png\_crc\_read(png\_ptr, buf, truelen);
3) Possible NULL-pointer crash in png\_handle\_iCCP (pngrutil.c) (this flaw is
duplicated in multiple other locations).
There are lots of lines such as these in the code:
chunkdata = (png\_charp)png\_malloc(png\_ptr, length + 1);
Where "length" comes from the PNG. If length is set to UINT\_MAX then length + 1 will equate to zero, leading to the PNG malloc routines to return NULL and
subsequent access to crash. These lengths are sometimes checked to ensure
they are smaller that INT\_MAX, but it is not clear that all code paths perform
this check, i.e. png\_push\_read\_chunk in pngpread.c does not do this check
(this is progressive reading mode as used by browsers).
4) Theoretical integer overflow in allocation in png\_handle\_sPLT (pngrutil.c)
This isn't likely to cause problems in practice, but there's the possibility
of an integer overflow during this allocation:
new\_palette.entries = (png\_sPLT\_entryp)png\_malloc(
png\_ptr, new\_palette.nentries \* sizeof(png\_sPLT\_entry));
5) Integer overflow in png\_read\_png (pngread.c)
A PNG with excessive height may cause an integer overflow on a memory
allocation and subsequent crash allocating row pointers. This line is possibly
faulty; I can't see anywhere that enforces a maximum PNG height:
info\_ptr->row\_pointers = (png\_bytepp)png\_malloc(png\_ptr,
info\_ptr->height \* sizeof(png\_bytep));
6) Integer overflows during progressive reading.
There are many lines like the following, which are prone to integer overflow:
if (png\_ptr->push\_length + 4 > png\_ptr->buffer\_size)
It is not clear how dangerous this is.
7) Other flaws.
There is broad potential for other integer overflows which I have not spotted -
the amount of integer arithmetic surrounding buffer handling is large,
unfortunately.

## libpng fails to properly check length of transparency chunk (tRNS) data

#### Vulnerability Note VU#388984

Original Release Date: 2004-08-04 | Last Revised: 2005-06-14

---

### Overview

The Portable Network Graphics library ([libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)) contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability, which could lead to arbitrary code execution on an affected system.

### Description

| The Portable Network Graphics ([PNG](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Contents.html)) image format is used as an alternative to other image formats such as the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF). The libpng reference library is available for application developers to support the PNG image format.  According to the PNG [Chunk Specification](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Chunks.html), PNG images contain a series of chunks including the IHDR, IDAT, and IEND chunks. In addition to these required chunks, a PNG image may contain one or more optional chunks. The optional tRNS chunk is responsible for specifying images that use simple transparency. There are several components of the tRNS chunk. If the PLTE block is not present in a tRNS chunk, a logic error in the code responsible for validating the data segments of the tRNS chunk may lead to a buffer overflow condition. The buffer overflow vulnerability occurs in the png\_handle\_tRNS() function, which is responsible for ensuring that PNG images are formatted properly. When processing malformed PNG images, this function may fail to properly validate the length of the transparency chunk (tRNS) data. Multiple applications support the PNG image format, including web browsers, email clients, and various graphic utilities. Because multiple products have used the libpng reference library to implement native PNG image processing, multiple applications will be affected by this issue in different ways.Please note that this vulnerability is known to exist in Microsoft Windows Messenger and MSN Messenger. Please see [MS05-009](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-009.mspx) for more details. For information regarding how this vulnerability affects Microsoft Internet Explorer, refer to [MS05-025](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-025.mspx). |

### [Apple Computer Inc.](#CRDY-636R79) Affected

Notified:  July 16, 2004  Updated: May 17, 2005

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

APPLE-SA-2004-09-09 Mac OS X 10.3.5

Mac OS X 10.3.5 is now available and delivers security enhancements
for the following components:

Component: libpng (Portable Network Graphics)
CVE-IDs: CAN-2002-1363, CAN-2004-0421, CAN-2004-0597,
CAN-2004-0598, CAN-2004-0599
Impact: Malicious png images can cause application crashes and could
execute arbitrary code

Description: A number of buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences
and integer overflows have been discovered in the reference library
for reading and writing PNG images. These vulnerabilities have been
corrected in libpng which is used by the CoreGraphics and AppKit
frameworks in Mac OS X. After installing this update, applications
that use the PNG image format via these frameworks will be protected
against these flaws.

Note: The libpng security fixes are also available separately for Mac
OS X 10.3.4 and Mac OS X 10.2.8 via Security Update 2004-08-09.

==================

Component: Safari
CVE ID: CAN-2004-0743
Impact: In a special situation, navigation using the forward/backward
buttons can re-send form data to a GET url.

Description: This is for a situation where a web form is sent to a
server using a POST method which issues an HTTP redirect to a GET
method url. Using the forward/backward buttons will cause Safari to
re-POST the form data to the GET url. Safari has been modified so
that in this situation forward/backward navigation will result in only
a GET method.

==================

Component: TCP/IP Networking
CVE ID: CAN-2004-0744
Impact: Maliciously crafted IP fragments can use too many system
resources preventing normal network operation.

Description: The "Rose Attack" describes a specially constructed
sequence of IP fragments designed to consume system resources. The
TCP/IP implementation has been modified to limit the resources
consumed and prevents this denial of service attack.

================================================

Mac OS X 10.3.5 may be obtained from the Software Update
pane in System Preferences, or Apple's Software Downloads web site:

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces a prior security bulletin for Windows Media Player only. The security bulletin ID and version that is affected is listed in the following table.

| Bulletin ID | Windows Media Player 9 Series | MSN Messenger 6.1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [**MS03-021**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=16898) | Replaced |  |
| [**MS04-010**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=25548) |  | Replaced |

**Why have you issued a version 2 of this bulletin?**

Subsequent to the release of this bulletin, it was determined that the update for Windows Messenger version 4.7.0.2009 (when running on Windows XP Service Pack 1) was failing to install when distributed via SMS or AutoUpdate. The updated package corrects this behavior.

**Customers who have successfully installed the previous update and are now running the 4.7.0.2010 version of Windows Messenger are protected from the vulnerability and do not need to take any action at this time.**

**How does the extended support for Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition affect the release of security updates for these operating systems?**

Microsoft will only release security updates for critical security issues. Non-critical security issues are not offered during this support period. For more information about the Microsoft Support Lifecycle policies for these operating systems, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33327).

For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**Note** A Critical security update for these platforms is available and is provided as part of this security bulletin and can be downloaded from the [Windows Update Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130).

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by any of the vulnerabilities that are addressed in this security bulletin?**

Yes. Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition are critically affected by this vulnerability. A Critical security update for these platforms is available and is provided as part of this security bulletin and can be downloaded from the [Windows Update Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130).
For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**How can I get an update for MSN Messenger?**

An update for MSN Messenger is available via the download link under the Affected Software section of this bulletin. Additionally, an updated version of MSN Messenger will be offered directly to customers when they log into MSN Messenger beginning shortly after this update is released.

**Why is the update to Windows Messenger 5.0 an upgrade to version 5.1 instead of an update to 5.0?**

Due to the architecture of Windows Messenger 5.0, it is not possible to provide an incremental patch. Any fix to Windows Messenger 5.0 requires the deployment of a completely updated Windows Messenger package, in this case the Windows Messenger 5.1 package.

**What functionality changes will this new version of Windows Messenger contain?**

As well as including the security fix pertaining to this bulletin; Windows Messenger 5.1 contains some additional bug fixes over Windows Messenger 5.0. Full details are on the [Windows Messenger 5.1 download page](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=a8d9eb73-5f8c-4b9a-940f-9157a3b3d774).

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine if this update is required?**

MBSA will determine if this update is required for Windows Media Player. MBSA will not determine if this update is required for Windows Messenger or MSN Messenger. It will provide a note message to this effect. See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460) for information regarding note messages in MBSA.

Microsoft has made available an [Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) to assist customers with the detection of needed security updates not currently supported by MBSA.

For detailed information about the programs that MBSA currently does not detect, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460)

**What is the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST)?**

As part of an ongoing commitment to provide detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft delivers a stand-alone detection tool whenever the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and the Office Detection Tool (ODT) cannot detect whether the update is required for an MSRC release cycle. This stand-alone tool is called the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST) and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a version of the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers can run the tool from a command line interface (CLI) and view the results of the XML output file. To help customers better utilize the tool, [detailed documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) will be provided with the tool.

## Vulnerability Details

#### PNG Processing Vulnerability in Windows Media Player - CAN-2004-1244:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Media Player because it does not properly handle PNG files with excessive width or height values. An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious PNG that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site or clicked a link in a malicious e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for PNG Processing Vulnerability in Windows Media Player- CAN-2004-1244:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability through media containing a reference to a malicious PNG file. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for PNG Processing Vulnerability in Windows Media Player - CAN-2004-1244:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

There are several different attack vectors that Microsoft has identified for this vulnerability. Each attack vector has a different workaround.

* **Static WMP File Extension Attack workaround**

  **Disassociate the WMP file extensions.**
  Disassociate the file extensions (.ASX, .WAX, .WVX, .WPL, .WMX, .WMS, .WMZ) in Windows to avoid previewing or opening files that point to malformed PNG files.

  Manual Steps - Windows Media Player method:

  + Launch Windows Explorer
  + On the Tools Menu select âFolder Optionsâ
  + Select the âFile Typesâ tab
  + Scroll to find the .ASX file extension and then press the âDeleteâ button
  + Repeat step 4 for each of the file extensions listed above.

  In addition, enterprise customers can configure Outlook to block the dangerous files listed using the steps documented in [Microsoft Knowledgebase Article 837388](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=837388). Use these instructions to add the documented file extensions to the Level1 block list.

  Home users can configure Outlook Express to block the dangerous files listed using the steps documented in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=291387). Use this information to configure each of the file extensions as âconfirm open after downloadâ in the Windows file types dialog.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Deleting the file associations with Media Player has a high potential for breaking corporate users who may be using Windows Media Server / Player to deliver web casts, training etc.
  Home users trying to watch streaming content on various Web sites may also be impacted by implementing this workaround.
* **Internet Explorer workaround for WMP ActiveX attack**

  **Disable the Windows Media Player ActiveX Control**. To prevent against an attack within a webpage follow these steps to disable the Windows Media Player ActiveX Control:

  Follow the instructions documented in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q240797) to killbit the following CLSIDs in Internet Explorer:

  ```
  CLSID:{6BF52A52-394A-11D3-B153-00C04F79FAA6}PROGID:WMPlayer.OCX.7
  CLSID:{22D6F312-B0F6-11D0-94AB-0080C74C7E95}PROGID:MediaPlayer.MediaPlayer.1
  CLSID:{05589FA1-C356-11CE-BF01-00AA0055595A}PROGID:AMOVIE.ActiveMovieControl.2

  ```

  **Impact of Workaround:**

  When you disable the Windows Media Player ActiveX control, pages using this control will no longer function as designed. This prevents any content from being played though the control, including audio and video.
* **Content-Type HTTP Header Attack**

  The only way to prevent this attack is to remove all of the possible MIME type entries from the registry that associate Windows Media Player with the MIME type listed in the Content-Type header being returned by the server since they all can be abused to exploit the vulnerability. Below is a list of MIME types that are associated with the WMP CLSID.

  ```
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/vnd.ms-wpl
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/x-mplayer2
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/x-ms-wmd
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/x-ms-wmz

  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\audio/x-mpg
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\audio/x-ms-wax
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\audio/x-ms-wma
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\audio/x-wav
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\midi/mid
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/avi
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/mpeg
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/mpg
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/msvideo
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-ivf
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-mpeg
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-mpeg2a
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-ms-asf
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-ms-asf-plugin
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-msvideo
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-ms-wm
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-ms-wmp
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-ms-wmv
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-ms-wmx
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-ms-wvx

  ```

  **Impact of Workaround:**

  + These MIME type registry keys all have a CLSID value which points to the following CLSID:

    HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\CLSID\{CD3AFA8F-B84F-48F0-9393-7EDC34128127}\InprocServer32
    This CLSID is associated with WMP.DLL which is responsible for launching Windows Media Player when these MIME types are used. Un-registering WMP.DLL will break Windows Media Player.
  + The MIME types listed in this workaround are specific to Windows XP. There may be additional MIME types available on other platforms.

### Background

Mozilla is a popular web browser that includes a mail and newsreader.
Galeon and Epiphany are both web browsers that use gecko, the Mozilla
rendering engine. Mozilla Firefox is the next-generation browser from
the Mozilla project that incorporates advanced features that are yet to
be incorporated into Mozilla. Mozilla Thunderbird is the
next-generation mail client from the Mozilla project.

### Description

Mozilla, Galeon, Epiphany, Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird
contain the following vulnerabilities:

* All Mozilla tools use libpng for graphics. This library contains a
  buffer overflow which may lead to arbitrary code execution.
* If a user imports a forged Certificate Authority (CA) certificate,
  it may overwrite and corrupt the valid CA already installed on the
  machine.

Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox, and other gecko-based browsers also contain a
bug in their caching which may allow the SSL icon to remain visible,
even when the site in question is an insecure site.

### Impact

Users of Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox, and other gecko-based browsers are
susceptible to SSL certificate spoofing, a Denial of Service against
legitimate SSL sites, crashes, and arbitrary code execution. Users of
Mozilla Thunderbird are susceptible to crashes and arbitrary code
execution via malicious e-mails.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround for most of these vulnerabilities. All
users are advised to upgrade to the latest available version.

### Resolution

All users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv your-version
 # emerge your-version
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# libpng: Numerous vulnerabilities — GLSA **200408-03**

libpng contains numerous vulnerabilities potentially allowing an attacker
to perform a Denial of Service attack or even execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/libpng** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.2.5-r7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.5-r8** |

### Background

libpng is a standard library used to process PNG (Portable Network
Graphics) images. It is used by several other programs, including web
browsers and potentially server processes.

### Description

libpng contains numerous vulnerabilities including null pointer dereference
errors and boundary errors in various functions.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause programs linked
against the library to crash or execute arbitrary code with the permissions
of the user running the vulnerable program, which could be the root user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version.

### Resolution

All libpng users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=media-libs/libpng-1.2.5-r8"
 # emerge ">=media-libs/libpng-1.2.5-r8"
```

You should also run revdep-rebuild to rebuild any packages that depend on
older versions of libpng :

```
 # revdep-rebuild
```

1. Topic:

Updated mozilla, galeon and epiphany packages that fix multiple
vulnerabilities are now available.

Mozilla is an open-source Web browser, designed for standards
compliance, performance, and portability.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

Note that some of these issues have already been fixed in Redhat 9 and
Fedora Core 1. Please refer to previous advisories for details.

NISCC testing of implementations of the S/MIME protocol uncovered a number
of bugs in NSS versions prior to 3.9. The parsing of unexpected ASN.1
constructs within S/MIME data could cause Mozilla to crash or consume large
amounts of memory. A remote attacker could potentially trigger these bugs
by sending a carefully-crafted S/MIME message to a victim. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0564 to this issue.

Andreas Sandblad discovered a cross-site scripting issue that affects
various versions of Mozilla. When linking to a new page it is still
possible to interact with the old page before the new page has been
successfully loaded. Any Javascript events will be invoked in the context
of the new page, making cross-site scripting possible if the different
pages belong to different domains. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0191 to
this issue.

Flaws have been found in the cookie path handling between a number of Web
browsers and servers. The HTTP cookie standard allows a Web server
supplying a cookie to a client to specify a subset of URLs on the origin
server to which the cookie applies. Web servers such as Apache do not
filter returned cookies and assume that the client will only send back
cookies for requests that fall within the server-supplied subset of URLs.
However, by supplying URLs that use path traversal (/../) and character
encoding, it is possible to fool many browsers into sending a cookie to a
path outside of the originally-specified subset. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0594 to this issue.

Zen Parse reported improper input validation to the SOAPParameter object
constructor leading to an integer overflow and controllable heap
corruption. Malicious JavaScript could be written to utilize this flaw and
could allow arbitrary code execution. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0722 to
this issue.

During a source code audit, Chris Evans discovered a buffer overflow and
integer overflows which affect the libpng code inside Mozilla. An attacker
could create a carefully crafted PNG file in such a way that it would cause
Mozilla to crash or execute arbitrary code when the image was viewed.
(CAN-2004-0597, CAN-2004-0599)

Zen Parse reported a flaw in the POP3 capability. A malicious POP3 server
could send a carefully crafted response that would cause a heap overflow
and potentially allow execution of arbitrary code as the user running
Mozilla. (CAN-2004-0757)

Marcel Boesch found a flaw that allows a CA certificate to be imported with
a DN the same as that of the built-in CA root certificates, which can cause
a denial of service to SSL pages, as the malicious certificate is treated
as invalid. (CAN-2004-0758)

Met - Martin Hassman reported a flaw in Mozilla that could allow malicious
Javascript code to upload local files from a users machine without
requiring confirmation. (CAN-2004-0759)

Mindlock Security reported a flaw in ftp URI handling. By using a NULL
character (%00) in a ftp URI, Mozilla can be confused into opening a
resource as a different MIME type. (CAN-2004-0760)

Mozilla does not properly prevent a frame in one domain from injecting
content into a frame that belongs to another domain, which facilitates
website spoofing and other attacks, also known as the frame injection
vulnerability. (CAN-2004-0718)

Tolga Tarhan reported a flaw that can allow a malicious webpage to use a
redirect sequence to spoof the security lock icon that makes a webpage
appear to be encrypted. (CAN-2004-0761)

Jesse Ruderman reported a security issue that affects a number of browsers
including Mozilla that could allow malicious websites to install arbitrary
extensions by using interactive events to manipulate the XPInstall Security
dialog box. (CAN-2004-0762)

Emmanouel Kellinis discovered a caching flaw in Mozilla which allows
malicious websites to spoof certificates of trusted websites via
redirects and Javascript that uses the "onunload" method. (CAN-2004-0763)

Mozilla allowed malicious websites to hijack the user interface via the
"chrome" flag and XML User Interface Language (XUL) files. (CAN-2004-0764)

The cert_TestHostName function in Mozilla only checks the hostname portion
of a certificate when the hostname portion of the URI is not a fully
qualified domain name (FQDN). This flaw could be used for spoofing if an
attacker had control of machines on a default DNS search path. (CAN-2004-0765)

Jesse Ruderman discovered a cross-domain scripting bug in Mozilla. If
a user is tricked into dragging a javascript link into another frame or
page, it becomes possible for an attacker to steal or modify sensitive
information from that site. Additionally, if a user is tricked into
dragging two links in sequence to another window (not frame), it is
possible for the attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0905 to this issue.

Gael Delalleau discovered an integer overflow which affects the BMP
handling code inside Mozilla. An attacker could create a carefully crafted
BMP file in such a way that it would cause Mozilla to crash or execute
arbitrary code when the image is viewed. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0904 to
this issue.

Georgi Guninski discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the vCard
display routines. An attacker could create a carefully crafted vCard file
in such a way that it would cause Mozilla to crash or execute arbitrary
code when viewed. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0903 to this issue.

Wladimir Palant discovered a flaw in the way javascript interacts with
the clipboard. It is possible that an attacker could use malicious
javascript code to steal sensitive data which has been copied into the
clipboard. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0908 to this issue.

Georgi Guninski discovered a heap based buffer overflow in the "Send
Page" feature. It is possible that an attacker could construct a link in
such a way that a user attempting to forward it could result in a crash or
arbitrary code execution. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0902 to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

## libpng png\_handle\_sBIT() performs insufficient bounds checking

#### Vulnerability Note VU#817368

Original Release Date: 2004-08-04 | Last Revised: 2005-06-14

---

### Overview

The Portable Network Graphics library ([libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)) contains a flaw that could introduce a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

### Description

| The Portable Network Graphics ([PNG](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Contents.html)) image format is used as an alternative to other image formats such as the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF). The libpng reference library is available for application developers to support the PNG image format.  A potentially insufficient bounds check error exists within the png\_handle\_sBIT() function. A similar error exists in the png\_handle\_hIST() function. While the code that contains these errors could potentially permit a buffer overflow to occur during a subsequent png\_crc\_read() operation, it is unclear what practical vulnerabilities they might present in applications using libpng.Multiple applications support the PNG image format, including web browsers, email clients, and various graphic utilities. Because multiple products have used the libpng reference library to implement native PNG image processing, multiple applications will be affected by this issue in different ways.Please note that this vulnerability is known to exist in Microsoft Windows Messenger and MSN Messenger. Please see [MS05-009](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-009.mspx) for more details. For information regarding how this vulnerability affects Microsoft Internet Explorer, refer to [MS05-025](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-025.mspx). |
