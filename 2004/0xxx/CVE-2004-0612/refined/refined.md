- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "Mobile Code" filter in ZoneAlarm Pro, which is designed to block potentially dangerous web objects (ActiveX, Java Applets, certain MIME objects), does not filter SSL content.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of SSL content filtering by the "Mobile Code" filter. Specifically, it fails to block "application/*" MIME types over SSL.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can bypass ZoneAlarm Pro's "Mobile Code" filter by hosting malicious content (e.g., ActiveX, Java Applets) on an SSL site. This allows the attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code or perform other malicious actions on the victim's machine.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves luring a ZoneAlarm Pro user to a malicious SSL site hosting dangerous "Mobile Code".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to set up a malicious SSL site hosting the attack content and needs to entice the victim to visit this site.
