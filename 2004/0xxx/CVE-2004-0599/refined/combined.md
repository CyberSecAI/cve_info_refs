## libpng png\_handle\_sPLT() integer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#477512

Original Release Date: 2004-08-04 | Last Revised: 2005-06-01

---

### Overview

The Portable Network Graphics library ([libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)) contains a flaw that could introduce a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

### Description

| The Portable Network Graphics ([PNG](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Contents.html)) image format is used as an alternative to other image formats such as the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF). The libpng reference library is available for application developers to support the PNG image format.  A potential integer overflow error exists during a memory allocation within the png\_handle\_sPLT() function. While the code that contains this error introduces a dangerous condition, it is unclear what practical vulnerabilities it might present in applications using libpng.Multiple applications support the PNG image format, including web browsers, email clients, and various graphic utilities. Because multiple products have used the libpng reference library to implement native PNG image processing, multiple applications will be affected by this issue in different ways. |

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

APPLE-SA-2004-09-09 Mac OS X 10.3.5

Mac OS X 10.3.5 is now available and delivers security enhancements
for the following components:

Component: libpng (Portable Network Graphics)
CVE-IDs: CAN-2002-1363, CAN-2004-0421, CAN-2004-0597,
CAN-2004-0598, CAN-2004-0599
Impact: Malicious png images can cause application crashes and could
execute arbitrary code

Description: A number of buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences
and integer overflows have been discovered in the reference library
for reading and writing PNG images. These vulnerabilities have been
corrected in libpng which is used by the CoreGraphics and AppKit
frameworks in Mac OS X. After installing this update, applications
that use the PNG image format via these frameworks will be protected
against these flaws.

Note: The libpng security fixes are also available separately for Mac
OS X 10.3.4 and Mac OS X 10.2.8 via Security Update 2004-08-09.

Package        : libpng3
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows, integer overflow
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0955

Several integer overflows have been discovered by its upstream
developers in libpng, a commonly used library to display PNG graphics.
They could be exploited to cause arbitrary code to be executed when a
specially crafted PNG image is processed.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.1-1.1.woody.9.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.5.0-9.

We recommend that you upgrade your libpng3 packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

CESA-2004-001 - rev 4
[See all my vulnerabilities at http://scary.beasts.org/security]
libPNG 1.2.5 stack-based buffer overflow and other code concerns
================================================================
Programs : libpng users including mozilla, konqueror, various e-mail
clients, generally lots. Also reports that some versions of
IE are vulnerable to some of the problems.
Severity : - A malicious website serving a malicious PNG file could
compromise the browsers of visitors.
- A malicious PNG could be sent via e-mail and compromise
the e-mail viewer of the recipient.
- For systems with user-providable images for "face
browsers", a local system compromise could be possible via
a malicious PNG.
CAN identifier(s): CAN-2004-0597 (the serious one), CAN-2004-0598,
CAN-2004-0599
CERT VU#s : VU#388984 (the serious one), VU#236656, VU#160448,
VU#477512, VU#817368, VU#286464
This advisory lists code flaws discovered by inspection of the libpng-1.2.5
code. Only the first one has been examined in practice to confirm
exploitability. The other flaws certainly warrant fixing.
A patch which should plug all these issues is appended beneath the advisory.
NOTE! This patch serves as demo purposes for the flaws only. An official
v1.2.6 libpng with an official, slightly different fix will be released by
the libpng team in parallel with this advisory.
1) Remotely exploitable stack-based buffer overrun in png\_handle\_tRNS
(pngrutil.c)
If a PNG file is of the correct format, a length check on PNG data is missed
prior to filling a buffer on the stack from the PNG data. The exact flaw would
seem to be a logic error; failure to bail out of a function after a warning
condition is hit, here:
if (!(png\_ptr->mode & PNG\_HAVE\_PLTE))
{
/\* Should be an error, but we can cope with it \*/
png\_warning(png\_ptr, "Missing PLTE before tRNS");
}
else if (length > (png\_uint\_32)png\_ptr->num\_palette)
{
png\_warning(png\_ptr, "Incorrect tRNS chunk length");
png\_crc\_finish(png\_ptr, length);
return;
}
We can see, if the first warning condition is hit, the length check is missed
due to the use of an "else if".
A PNG crafted to trip this is available at
http://scary.beasts.org/misc/pngtest\_bad.png
It crashes both mozilla and konqueror.
A scarier possibility is targetted exploitation by e-mailing a nasty PNG to
someone who uses a graphical e-mail client to decode PNGs with a vulnerable
libpng.
2) Dangerous code in png\_handle\_sBIT (pngrutil.c) (Similar code in
png\_handle\_hIST).
Although seemingly not exploitable, there is dangerous code in this function.
It relies on checks scattered elsewhere in the code in order to not overflow
a 4-byte stack buffer. This line here should upper-bound the read onto the
stack to 4 bytes:
png\_crc\_read(png\_ptr, buf, truelen);
3) Possible NULL-pointer crash in png\_handle\_iCCP (pngrutil.c) (this flaw is
duplicated in multiple other locations).
There are lots of lines such as these in the code:
chunkdata = (png\_charp)png\_malloc(png\_ptr, length + 1);
Where "length" comes from the PNG. If length is set to UINT\_MAX then length + 1 will equate to zero, leading to the PNG malloc routines to return NULL and
subsequent access to crash. These lengths are sometimes checked to ensure
they are smaller that INT\_MAX, but it is not clear that all code paths perform
this check, i.e. png\_push\_read\_chunk in pngpread.c does not do this check
(this is progressive reading mode as used by browsers).
4) Theoretical integer overflow in allocation in png\_handle\_sPLT (pngrutil.c)
This isn't likely to cause problems in practice, but there's the possibility
of an integer overflow during this allocation:
new\_palette.entries = (png\_sPLT\_entryp)png\_malloc(
png\_ptr, new\_palette.nentries \* sizeof(png\_sPLT\_entry));
5) Integer overflow in png\_read\_png (pngread.c)
A PNG with excessive height may cause an integer overflow on a memory
allocation and subsequent crash allocating row pointers. This line is possibly
faulty; I can't see anywhere that enforces a maximum PNG height:
info\_ptr->row\_pointers = (png\_bytepp)png\_malloc(png\_ptr,
info\_ptr->height \* sizeof(png\_bytep));
6) Integer overflows during progressive reading.
There are many lines like the following, which are prone to integer overflow:
if (png\_ptr->push\_length + 4 > png\_ptr->buffer\_size)
It is not clear how dangerous this is.
7) Other flaws.
There is broad potential for other integer overflows which I have not spotted -
the amount of integer arithmetic surrounding buffer handling is large,
unfortunately.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## libpng integer overflow in image height processing

#### Vulnerability Note VU#160448

Original Release Date: 2004-08-04 | Last Revised: 2004-08-04

---

### Overview

The Portable Network Graphics library ([libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)) contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability which could cause affected applications to crash.

### Description

| The Portable Network Graphics ([PNG](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Contents.html)) image format is used as an alternative to other image formats such as the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF). The libpng reference library is available for application developers to support the PNG image format.  An integer overflow error exists in the handling of PNG image height within the png\_read\_png() function. As a result, a PNG image with excessive height may cause an integer overflow on a memory allocation and could cause the affected application to crash.Multiple applications support the PNG image format including web browsers, email clients, and various graphic utilities. Because multiple products have used the libpng reference library to implement native PNG image processing, multiple applications will be affected by this issue in different ways. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker could cause a vulnerable application to crash by supplying a specially-crafted PNG image. Vulnerable applications that read images from network sources could be exploited remotely. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from the vendor**Patches have been released to address this vulnerability. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more details. |

Debian Security Advisory DSA 570-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
October 20th, 2004                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : libpng
Vulnerability  : integer overflow
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0955

Several integer overflows have been discovered by its upstream
developers in libpng, a commonly used library to display PNG graphics.
They could be exploited to cause arbitrary code to be executed when a
specially crafted PNG image is processed.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.12-3.woody.9.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.15-8.

We recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## libpng contains integer overflows in progressive display image reading

#### Vulnerability Note VU#286464

Original Release Date: 2004-08-04 | Last Revised: 2005-06-01

---

### Overview

The Portable Network Graphics library ([libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)) contains several flaws in progressive image handling that could introduce a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

### Description

| The Portable Network Graphics ([PNG](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Contents.html)) image format is used as an alternative to other image formats such as the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF). The libpng reference library is available for application developers to support the PNG image format.  The libpng library features the ability to display interlaced, or progressive display, PNG files or streams. A number of potential integer overflow errors exist in libpng's handling of such progressive display images. While the code that contains these errors introduces dangerous conditions, it is unclear what practical vulnerabilities it might present in applications using libpng.Multiple applications support the PNG image format, including web browsers, email clients, and various graphic utilities. Because multiple products have used the libpng reference library to implement native PNG image processing, multiple applications will be affected by this issue in different ways. |

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

APPLE-SA-2004-09-09 Mac OS X 10.3.5

Mac OS X 10.3.5 is now available and delivers security enhancements
for the following components:

Component: libpng (Portable Network Graphics)
CVE-IDs: CAN-2002-1363, CAN-2004-0421, CAN-2004-0597,
CAN-2004-0598, CAN-2004-0599
Impact: Malicious png images can cause application crashes and could
execute arbitrary code

Description: A number of buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences
and integer overflows have been discovered in the reference library
for reading and writing PNG images. These vulnerabilities have been
corrected in libpng which is used by the CoreGraphics and AppKit
frameworks in Mac OS X. After installing this update, applications
that use the PNG image format via these frameworks will be protected
against these flaws.

Note: The libpng security fixes are also available separately for Mac
OS X 10.3.4 and Mac OS X 10.2.8 via Security Update 2004-08-09.

# libpng: Numerous vulnerabilities — GLSA **200408-03**

libpng contains numerous vulnerabilities potentially allowing an attacker
to perform a Denial of Service attack or even execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/libpng** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.2.5-r7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.5-r8** |

### Background

libpng is a standard library used to process PNG (Portable Network
Graphics) images. It is used by several other programs, including web
browsers and potentially server processes.

### Description

libpng contains numerous vulnerabilities including null pointer dereference
errors and boundary errors in various functions.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause programs linked
against the library to crash or execute arbitrary code with the permissions
of the user running the vulnerable program, which could be the root user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version.

### Resolution

All libpng users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=media-libs/libpng-1.2.5-r8"
 # emerge ">=media-libs/libpng-1.2.5-r8"
```

You should also run revdep-rebuild to rebuild any packages that depend on
older versions of libpng :

```
 # revdep-rebuild
```

| Affected versions | < **1.3.17** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.17** |

### Background

Mozilla is a popular web browser that includes a mail and newsreader.
Galeon and Epiphany are both web browsers that use gecko, the Mozilla
rendering engine. Mozilla Firefox is the next-generation browser from
the Mozilla project that incorporates advanced features that are yet to
be incorporated into Mozilla. Mozilla Thunderbird is the
next-generation mail client from the Mozilla project.

### Description

Mozilla, Galeon, Epiphany, Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird
contain the following vulnerabilities:

* All Mozilla tools use libpng for graphics. This library contains a
  buffer overflow which may lead to arbitrary code execution.
* If a user imports a forged Certificate Authority (CA) certificate,
  it may overwrite and corrupt the valid CA already installed on the
  machine.

Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox, and other gecko-based browsers also contain a
bug in their caching which may allow the SSL icon to remain visible,
even when the site in question is an insecure site.

### Impact

Users of Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox, and other gecko-based browsers are
susceptible to SSL certificate spoofing, a Denial of Service against
legitimate SSL sites, crashes, and arbitrary code execution. Users of
Mozilla Thunderbird are susceptible to crashes and arbitrary code
execution via malicious e-mails.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround for most of these vulnerabilities. All
users are advised to upgrade to the latest available version.

### Resolution

All users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv your-version
 # emerge your-version
```
