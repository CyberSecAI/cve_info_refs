  "CVE-2004-0599": {
    "Description": "The libpng library has an integer overflow vulnerability in png_handle_sPLT(). An attacker can trigger this by sending a crafted PNG image that has a specially designed sPLT chunk, causing a memory allocation overflow.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow during memory allocation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Improper memory allocation size calculation"
    ],
    "Impact": "The integer overflow can cause a heap overflow, which might lead to a crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted PNG image",
      "Network-based attacks (e.g., via a website or email)"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to create or modify PNG image files and send it to a user, and the user needs to process that image"
