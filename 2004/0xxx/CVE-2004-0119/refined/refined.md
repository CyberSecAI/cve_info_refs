Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2004-0119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow within the Negotiate Security Software Provider (SSP) interface. Specifically, the interface fails to properly validate the size of a value used during the authentication protocol selection process, leading to the overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Buffer Overflow:** A classic vulnerability where a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory. In this case, the size of the input used for authentication protocol selection is not checked, leading to the overflow when the input is larger than expected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This implies the attacker can gain full control over the system.
*   **Denial of Service:** While remote code execution is possible, the vulnerability is more likely to cause a denial-of-service condition, rendering the service or system unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted network message to the affected system.
*   **Through Other Vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered through any interface which uses the Negotiate SSP interface to perform authentication. An attacker could exploit other pathways, such as logging on interactively or using another program that passes parameters to the vulnerable component (locally or remotely).
*   **Specifically,** this vulnerability can be triggered through the Negotiate SSP interface enabled in IIS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need valid credentials and can be anonymous.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted network messages to the vulnerable system.

**Affected Systems**
*   Windows XP
*   Windows Server 2003
*   Windows 2000
*   Systems running Internet Information Services (IIS)
