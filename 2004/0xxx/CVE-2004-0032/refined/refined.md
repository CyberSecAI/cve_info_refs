Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in PHPGEDVIEW 2.61:

**1) PHP Code Injection:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application uses user-controlled input (`PGV_BASE_DIRECTORY`) in `require` statements without proper sanitization.
*   **Vulnerability:**  PHP code injection vulnerability exists in `authentication_index.php`, `functions.php`, and `config_gedcom.php`. The `$PGV_BASE_DIRECTORY` variable is taken from user input and used in `require` statements. This allows an attacker to include a malicious PHP script from a remote server.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server. An attacker could execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by supplying a malicious URL for the `PGV_BASE_DIRECTORY` parameter, potentially leading to complete compromise of the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request with modified `PGV_BASE_DIRECTORY` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server and have a web server to host the malicious PHP script.

**2) Configuration Reset:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `editconfig.php` file is not removed after installation, leaving it accessible to potential attackers.
*  **Vulnerability:** An attacker can access the `editconfig.php` file to reconfigure the application.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can re-install and change the administrator password. This could lead to unauthorized access and control of the application.
*   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to `editconfig.php` through a web browser.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker must know the location of the `editconfig.php` file.

**3) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   **Root Cause:** User input in the search functionality is not properly sanitized before being displayed in the HTML.
*   **Vulnerability:** XSS vulnerability exists in `search.php`. The `firstname`, `lastname`, `place`, and `year` parameters are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the page, leading to potential session hijacking, cookie theft, or other client-side attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request with a malicious payload in `firstname`, `lastname`, `place` or `year` parameters.
*  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the server.

**4) Information Disclosure:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application allows access to `phpinfo()` output through the `admin.php` file.
*   **Vulnerability:** An attacker can access `phpinfo()` via `admin.php?action=phpinfo`
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive server information which could be used in further attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the `admin.php` page with `action=phpinfo` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
