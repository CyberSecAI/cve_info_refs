DoS! 4. (race condition as well)  Actual Results:   eupdatedb has insecure temp file handling procedure. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-28 07:37:24 UTC  ``` David --  Can you review/patch as appropriate? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  David Peter    2004-06-28 13:10:29 UTC  ``` Yes,  Thanks a lot for the bug report. I didn't know this problem. What would be the most reasonable way to fix this bug?  1. Delete /tmp/esearchdb.py.tmp, Open new file and write  If I use this solution, I have to find an other way to check if there is an instance of eupdatedb running.  2. Check if /tmp/esearchdb.py.tmp is a symlink -> delete or create  3. Other ways? Use a file in an other directory?

# Esearch: Insecure temp file handling — GLSA **200407-01**

The eupdatedb utility in esearch creates a file in /tmp without first
checking for symlinks. This makes it possible for any user to create
arbitrary files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-portage/esearch** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.6.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.6.2** |

### Background

Esearch is a replacement for the Portage command "emerge search". It
uses an index to speed up searching of the Portage tree.

### Description

The eupdatedb utility uses a temporary file (/tmp/esearchdb.py.tmp) to
indicate that the eupdatedb process is running. When run, eupdatedb
checks to see if this file exists, but it does not check to see if it
is a broken symlink. In the event that the file is a broken symlink,
the script will create the file pointed to by the symlink, instead of
printing an error and exiting.

### Impact

An attacker could create a symlink from /tmp/esearchdb.py.tmp to a
nonexistent file (such as /etc/nologin), and the file will be created
the next time esearchdb is run.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users should upgrade to
the latest available version of esearch.

### Resolution

All users should upgrade to the latest available version of esearch, as
follows:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=app-portage/esearch-0.6.2"
 # emerge ">=app-portage/esearch-0.6.2"
```
