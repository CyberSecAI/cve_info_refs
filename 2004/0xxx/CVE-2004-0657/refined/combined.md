## NTP service vulnerable to internal overflow if date / time offset is greater than 34 years

#### Vulnerability Note VU#584606

Original Release Date: 2004-03-05 | Last Revised: 2004-03-05

---

### Overview

NTP (Network TIme Protocol) contains an integer overflow vulnerability that may lead to clients receiving an incorrect date/time offset.

### Description

| NTP (Network Time Protocol) is a method by which client machines can synchronize the local date and time with a reference server. The server will miscalculate the offset reply, if it receives a request from an NTP client containing a date that is more or less than 34 years of the server's date.  This offset is a 64-bit value, with 32 bits representing whole seconds, and 32 bits representing fractions of a second . The 34-year limit is imposed by the use of a 32-bit signed integer.The NTP server performs a series of calculations, accounting for transmission delay and computing time, resulting in a value which represents the difference between the NTP server time and the requesting machine's time. The packet sent back to the client is a date/time offset, which is then used to update the client's date/time. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Clients making requests of an NTP server and supplying a date/time that is more than 34 years in the future (or past) from the NTP server date/time will receive an incorrect date/time offset from the server, resulting in an incorrect date/time on the client.  There is no known impact to the NTP server. |
