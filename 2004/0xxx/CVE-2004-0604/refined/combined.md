How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Jon Hood (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-19 14:00:47 UTC  ``` please mark gift-fasttrack-0.8.7 stable on all architectures- a vulnerability exists that allows the giFT daemon to be remotely crashable. It is not deemed a severe vulnerability, only crashing giFTd. The fix is to upgrade to gift-fasttrack-0.8.7. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Jon Hood (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-19 14:03:28 UTC  ``` Forgot to mention- this is just a null pointer vulnerability, I'm not sure if it was severe enough to report, but I thought I better be safe ;) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-20 01:52:22 UTC  ``` I see no reason of having ppc and sparc mark stable on this one, since afaik they never had this package stable anyway. amd64 marked stable, so I think it's ready.  I would vote for no GLSA on this one. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Jon Hood (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-20 10:49:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 33649](attachment.cgi?id=33649 "gift-fasttrack GLSA") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=33649&action=edit "gift-fasttrack GLSA")] gift-fasttrack GLSA  Ah, you are correct- sorry to bother you, ppc and sparc teams. I know I'm not the one who is normally in charge of GLSA's, but while they were working on the fix, I went ahead and drafted one. It is attached for reference should you chose to send one out. Otherwise, the vulnerable versions of this package have been removed from portage and this bug can be closed. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Jon Hood (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-20 10:51:38 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 33650](attachment.cgi?id=33650 "gift-fasttrack GLSA") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=33650&action=edit "gift-fasttrack GLSA")] gift-fasttrack GLSA ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Jason Wever (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-23 20:44:06 UTC  ``` Stable on sparc. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-24 09:32:30 UTC  ``` since remote users can crash the daemon (i.e. it is not directly controllable by the user) I'd say this deserves a GLSA. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-24 13:43:15 UTC  ``` GLSA 200406-19 ``` |  |
