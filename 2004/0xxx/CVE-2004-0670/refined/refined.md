- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Sending a long string as a password to the ZyXEL Prestige 650HW-31 DSL router causes it to reset. The software running on the router is identified as Rompager/4.7.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The router's handling of password input is vulnerable to a buffer overflow or similar issue when presented with an excessively long string, leading to a device reset.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The router resets, causing a denial-of-service by interrupting network connectivity. This allows an attacker to reset the router if the admin interface is exposed to the network.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a long string as a password via HTTP (port 80). Telnet was not tested.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have network access to the router's management interface (port 80).
