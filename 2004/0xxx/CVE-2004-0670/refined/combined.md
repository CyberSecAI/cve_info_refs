Hi, have not much time so here is the thing... There's a bug in the DSL
router Prestige 650HW-31, you just post a long string as password and the
router resets it self so is very easy to make a DNS to this router if people
doesnt have the aproppiate filters on port 80 (I didnt tried on Telnet).
This routers are very sold in Spain by Telefonica de España so spanish
people shouldt take a little care and setup their ports properly. The manual
is in Zyxel webpage so please dont ask me that sort of things. The router
come again online after the reset and syncronize DSL perfectly again.
Software in the router is that shit of Rompager/4.7, maybe its not ok
because I took this with a sniffer from the http header cos I dont have
access to the router I tested.

ç u Sami
