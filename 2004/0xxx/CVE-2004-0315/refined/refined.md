- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly manage received strings on TCP port 1080, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted string to the server on port 1080.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a string like `GET aaaa[ 1113 of a ]aaaa` to the server on TCP port 1080.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable server on TCP port 1080.
