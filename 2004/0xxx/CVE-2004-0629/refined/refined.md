{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from two flaws in how acroread handles UUEncoded filenames. First, it fails to validate the length of a filename before copying it into a fixed-size buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. Second, it doesn't check for backtick shell metacharacters in the filename before executing a command with a shell.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer Overflow: Failure to validate filename length before copying into a fixed-size buffer.",
    "Shell Metacharacter Injection: Failure to sanitize input by not checking for backtick shell metacharacters before executing a command with a shell."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code or programs with the privileges of the user running acroread.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can entice a user to open a malicious PDF file containing a specially crafted UUEncoded filename to trigger the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file with a specially crafted UUEncoded filename. They do not need to be on the same network as the victim."
