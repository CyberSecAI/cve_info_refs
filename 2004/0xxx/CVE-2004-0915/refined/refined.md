- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `hide_cvsroot` and `forbidden` settings in viewcvs were not properly enforced when exporting a repository as a tar archive.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control leading to information disclosure. The software failed to properly hide specified directories and files when exporting archives, which should have been restricted.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information, such as source code or other restricted files that were intended to be hidden.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user requests a tar archive export of a repository.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the viewcvs interface and request a tar archive export of a repository.
