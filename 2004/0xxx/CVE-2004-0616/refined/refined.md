The provided content describes a vulnerability in the BT Voyager 2000 Wireless ADSL Router. It allows an attacker to retrieve the ADSL account password in cleartext via SNMP.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The router stores the ADSL account password in cleartext and exposes it through SNMP.
- Default SNMP community strings ("public" and "private") are enabled and allow access to this sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cleartext storage of sensitive information (ADSL account password).
- Exposure of sensitive information via SNMP.
- Use of default SNMP community strings, which is a well-known and easily exploitable security flaw.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can obtain the ADSL account password, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the victim's internet connection.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the router to associate with it.
- After successful association with the network, the attacker can query SNMP with default community names.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to associate with the router's wireless network.
- The attacker must know the default community strings for SNMP, which are commonly "public" and "private".

The information contained in the advisory provides a full breakdown of the attack, and is more descriptive than the placeholder CVE description.
