- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow occurs when Whisper FTP Surfer attempts to create a temporary file using a long filename downloaded from an FTP server. The long filename, combined with the temporary folder path, exceeds the allocated buffer size.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient bounds checking when creating temporary files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The overflow can corrupt memory and cause a crash when the program attempts to delete the temporary file.  The vulnerability could also be potentially exploited for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can accurately overwrite the return address, though this is noted to be difficult due to the path of the temporary folder being variable.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to place a file with an extremely long filename on an FTP server. The user must then use the vulnerable Whisper FTP Surfer to attempt to open the file, triggering the creation of a temporary file and causing the overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to control an FTP server. The attacker also needs to trick the victim into downloading and opening the crafted file from the attacker's server using the vulnerable software.
