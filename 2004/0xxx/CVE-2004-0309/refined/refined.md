Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the Zone Labs desktop security products when processing the `RCPT TO` command argument during email analysis.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the `vsmon.exe` process.
- Improper validation of the length of the `RCPT TO` command argument.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
- Local Privilege Escalation.
- Remote code execution is possible if the attacker can make the targeted system send a crafted email.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted email with an overly long `RCPT TO` command.
- Exploiting the vulnerability through outgoing email messages analyzed by vulnerable ZoneLabs products.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send or manipulate email messages processed by a vulnerable Zone Labs product.
- No specific local access is required for remote exploitation if the attacker can cause a protected system to send a crafted email.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `vsmon.exe` process.
- The vulnerability affects ZoneAlarm 4.0 and above, ZoneAlarm Pro 4.0 and above, ZoneAlarm Plus 4.0 and above, and ZoneLabs Integrity client 4.0 and above.
- ZoneLabs promptly released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Riley Hassell.
- The advisory specifically mentions that the buffer overflow occurs when ZoneAlarm retrieves the destination email address from the message.
