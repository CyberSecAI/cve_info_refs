ZoneLabs SMTP Processing Buffer Overflow

Release Date:
February 18, 2004

Date Reported:
February 13, 2004

Severity:
Medium (Local Privilege Escalation/Remote Code Execution)

Vendor:
ZoneLabs Inc.

Software Affected:
ZoneAlarm 4.0 and above
ZoneAlarm Pro 4.0 and above
ZoneAlarm Plus 4.0 and above
ZoneLabs Integrity client 4.0 and above

Description:

ZoneLabs provides a suite of desktop firewall products. Products in this
suite such as ZoneAlarm analyze incoming and outgoing email messages for
malicious or otherwise abnormal content. When ZoneAlarm examines
outgoing email messages a buffer overflow condition is presented when
they retrieve the destination email address from the message. An
attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate his privileges to
SYSTEM on any machine protected by a vulnerable ZoneLabs product. This
vulnerability can also be exploited remotely if an attacker can
manipulate the protected system into sending an outgoing email message.

Technical Description:

A stack based buffer overflow vulnerability within vsmon.exe can be
exploited to execute code with the context of the SYSTEM account. The
vulnerability exists within the component responsible for processing the
RCPT TO command argument. By specifying a large argument to the RCPT TO
command an internal stack based buffer can be overflowed within the
TrueVector Internet Monitor (vsmon.exe) process.

Protection:
Retina Network Security Scanner has been updated to identify this
vulnerability.

Vendor Status:
ZoneLabs was contacted and within only a few days they produced an
update to eliminate this vulnerability within their products. We would
like to give special recognition to the responsiveness of ZoneLabs in
creating a fix to protect their customers.
