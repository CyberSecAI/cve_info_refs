- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper decoding of UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters in URLs by HP OpenView Select Access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software fails to correctly interpret UTF-8 encoded characters within URLs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote users can potentially bypass authorization checks and gain access to resources that they should not have access to.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker crafts malicious URLs with specific UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable HP OpenView Select Access server. They do not need to be authenticated initially.
