Symantec Security Advisory

SYM04-005

19 March, 2004
Symantec Norton Internet Security and Norton AntiSpam Remote Access
Vulnerability

Revision History
None

Risk Impact
High

Overview
NGSsoftware notified Symantec of a security vulnerability NGSsoftware had
found in the Symantec Norton Internet Security and Symantec Norton
AntiSpam 2004. If properly exploited this vulnerability could allow remote
execution of arbitrary code on a targeted system resulting in possible
system compromise.

Affected Components
Symantec Norton Internet Security 2004 and Professional for Windows
Symantec Norton AntiSpam 2004

Details
Symantec was alerted to a remote access vulnerability that NGSsoftware
discovered while evaluating Symantec Norton Internet Security 2004 and
Symantec Norton AntiSpam 2004.  Symantec Norton Internet Security and
Symantec Norton AntiSpam 2004 contain ActiveX components that do not do
proper bounds checking of external input.  A malicious individual could
potentially exploit these weaknesses to launch a local application on the
target system and possibly run arbitrary code of their choice on the local
system with elevated privileges.

To do this successfully, the attacker would need to either entice the
targeted user to visit a location where the malicious code could be
launched or to download and launch the malicious code on their system.
Successful execution of these security issues could result in compromise
of the targeted system.

Symantec Response
Symantec has verified the issues reported by NGSsoftware and released
patches for both Symantec Norton Internet Security and Symantec Norton
AntiSpam 2004 via Symantec LiveUpdate.  Customers should run Symantec
LiveUpdate manually to ensure all installed Symantec products are fully
updated.
·       Open any installed Symantec product
·       Click on LiveUpdate in the toolbar
·       Run LiveUpdate until all available Symantec product updates are
downloaded and installed

Symantec is unaware of any active exploits for or customer impact from
these issues.  Symantec will continue to evaluate the issues.

As a part of normal best practices, Symantec recommends using a
multi-layered approach to security. Users, at a minimum, should run both
personal firewall and antivirus applications with current updates to
provide multiple points of detection and protection to both inbound and
outbound threats.

Users should keep vendor-supplied patches for all application software and
operating systems up-to-date.

Users should further be wary of mysterious attachments and executables
delivered via email and be wary of visiting unknown/untrusted websites.

Do not open attachments or executables from unknown sources. Always err on
the side of caution.

Even if the sender is known, be wary of attachments if the sender does not
fully explain the attachment content in the body of the email. You do not
know the source of the attachment.

If in doubt, contact the sender before opening the attachment. If still in
doubt, delete the attachment without opening it.

CVE
Symantec has requested a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
candidate name for these issues.  We will revise this Advisory upon
receipt.

This is a candidate for inclusion in the CVE list (<http://cve.mitre.org>),
which standardizes names for security problems.

Credit:
Symantec appreciates the cooperation of Mark Litchfield and the
NGSsoftware research team in identifying this issue.

Symantec Product Security Contact:
Symantec takes the security and proper functionality of its products very
seriously.  As founding members in the Organization for Internet Safety,
Symantec follows the process of responsible disclosure.  Please contact
symsecurity@symantec.com if you feel you have discovered a potential or
actual security issue with a Symantec product.

Symantec strongly recommends using encrypted email for reporting
vulnerability information to symsecurity@symantec.com.  The SymSecurity
PGP key may be obtained from the Symantec Security Response site.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Description
***********

Symantec's Norton Internet Security 2004 Professional protects you and
your business from online threats. It eliminates viruses automatically,
blocks hackers, safeguards your personal information, fights spam, increases
online productivity, recovers lost or damaged files, and thoroughly deletes
confidential data you no longer need.

Details
*******

Installed with Norton Internet Security and Professional is an ActiveX
component that is marked safe for scripting, namely WrapNISUM Class
(c:\program files\Norton Internet Security Professional\WrapUM.dll).
Using the LaunchURL method an attacker has the ability to force the browser
to run arbitrary executables on the target.  In a real world attack, this
would more than likely take the form of a UNC path.  It's important to note
here that on those windows operating systems that support the WEBDAV
redirector file system if the UNC path cannot be reached over TCP port 139
or 445 it will switch to TCP Port 80 (http).  Needless to say this aspect
will allow attacks to go through corporate firewalls.  The attack can be
achieved either by encouraging the 'victim' to visit a malicious web page or
placing a script within the content of an (html) email.

Fix Information
***************

Shipped with all Symantec's products is the LiveUpdate feature. Open
Internet Security / Professional and select the LiveUpdate feature which
will retrieve the lastest patch.  It's worth mentioning Symantec's quick
response to this issue in ensuring their clients remain protected.
