Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly validate external input by the `WrapNISUM Class` ActiveX component (`WrapUM.dll`) within Symantec's Norton Internet Security and Norton AntiSpam 2004 products. This ActiveX control is marked as safe for scripting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The ActiveX control doesn't perform adequate bounds checking or input sanitization.
*   **Unsafe Method:** The `LaunchURL` method of the `WrapNISUM Class` can be exploited to execute arbitrary executables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can force the browser to run arbitrary executables on the target system.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise due to the ability to run code with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker can host a malicious web page containing exploit code that leverages the vulnerable ActiveX control.
*   **HTML Email:** The exploit code can also be embedded within an HTML email, which, when opened, can trigger the vulnerability.
*    **UNC Path Exploitation:** The attacker can use a UNC path in the `LaunchURL` method to execute programs from a network share. If TCP ports 139 or 445 are blocked, the system may try to connect over TCP port 80 (HTTP), potentially bypassing corporate firewalls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must either trick the victim into visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious HTML email.
*   **Scripting Knowledge:** The attacker needs to craft malicious code that exploits the vulnerable ActiveX control by using the `LaunchURL` method.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Symantec Norton Internet Security 2004 and Professional for Windows, and Symantec Norton AntiSpam 2004.
*   Symantec released patches through their LiveUpdate service.
*   NGSSoftware discovered and reported the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited through web browsers using the vulnerable ActiveX control.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2004-0364.
