How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves a newly-discovered, privately reported vulnerability. A denial of service vulnerability exists in the implementation of the IDirectPlay4 application programming interface (API) of Microsoft DirectPlay because of a lack of robust packet validation. The vulnerability is documented in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin.

If a user is running a networked DirectPlay application, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the DirectPlay application to fail. The user would have to restart the application to resume functionality.

Microsoft recommends that customers should consider applying the security update.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Windows 98, 98 SE, Me | Windows 2000 | Windows XP | Windows Server 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DirectPlay Vulnerability - [CAN-2004-0202](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2004-0202) | Denial of Service | Not Critical | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

## Vulnerability Details

#### DirectPlay Vulnerability - CAN-2004- 0202:

A denial of service vulnerability exists in the IDirectPlay4 Application Programming Interface (API) of Microsoft DirectPlay. Applications that implement this API are typically network-based multi-player games. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the application to fail.

#### Mitigating factors for DirectPlay Vulnerability - CAN-2004- 0202:

* Windows NT 4.0 is not affected by this vulnerability.
* Only the version 4 interfaces are affected by this vulnerability. If an application is using the version 8 interfaces, it is not affected. Newer games and applications are designed by using the version 8 interfaces.
* For an attack to be successful, a system would need to be actively running a DirectPlay game.
* Because DirectPlay is a network protocol that is designed to allow multi-player games, users who are playing games that do not use the version 4 interfaces of DirectPlay are not vulnerable to an attack.
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for DirectPlay Vulnerability - CAN-2004- 0202:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

**Do not run games or applications that are coded with the Version 4 DirectPlay APIs.**

Newer games and applications are typically coded by using the version 8 DirectPlay APIs. Although a complete list of games and applications that use the less recent DirectPlay 4 APIs is not currently available, these items are typically older computer games. The newer versions are not vulnerable.

#### FAQ for DirectPlay Vulnerability - CAN-2004- 0202:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability in the IDirectPlay4 API of Microsoft DirectPlay. Only the version 4 interfaces are affected by this vulnerability. Applications that implement these APIs are typically network-based multi-player games. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the application to fail.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The implementation of the IDirectPlay4 APIs within DirectPlay does not perform robust packet validation.

**What is DirectPlay?**

DirectPlay is a network protocol that shipped with Microsoft DirectX to help game developers create multi-player networked games without having to implement sophisticated network protocols. The version 4 implementation affected by this vulnerability is comprised of a set of three API interfaces. These interfaces include IDirectPlay4Server, IDirectPlay4Client, and IDirectPlay4Peer. Each of these interfaces launches network code which must be invoked for a system to be vulnerable to attack.

**What is DirectX?**

Microsoft [DirectX](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/) is a group of technologies that is designed to make Windows-based computers an ideal platform for running and displaying applications that are rich in multimedia elements such as full-color graphics, video, 3-D animation, and surround sound. DirectX is comprised of a set of low-level APIs that are used by Windows programs for multimedia support. The vulnerability covered in this update is in the implementation of the IDirectPlay4 APIs of the DirectPlay technology.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the DirectPlay application to fail, which would interrupt its normal operation. The user would have to restart the application for functionality to resume.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who could locate a system that is running a version 4 implementation of a DirectPlay-based application, establish a connection and deliver a malformed packet to the affected system could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a malformed packet, establishing a connection and sending the packet to an affected system, which could then cause the DirectPlay application to fail.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Because the affected component is within the DirectPlay network technology, systems that are used for multi-player network gaming are primarily at risk from this vulnerability.

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?**

No. Although Windows Millennium Edition does contain the affected component, the vulnerability is not critical. For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by implementing more robust packet validation.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and to perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, see the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/evaluation/capabilities/patch.mspx). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/20/featurepacks/suspack/) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, see the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sms/sms2003/patchupdate.mspx). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [**SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack**](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/sms/2003/downloads/featurepacks/adminpack.mspx) and in the [**SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack**](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/20/featurepacks/adminpack/)) to install these updates.
