________________________________________________________________________

Package:             squid (option "with_snmp yes" only)
Vulnerability:       denial of service
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:      Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= squid-2.5.6-20040913 >= squid-2.5.7-20041012
OpenPKG 2.2          none                    N.A.
OpenPKG 2.1          <= squid-2.5.6-2.1.0    >= squid-2.5.6-2.1.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to an iDEFENSE security advisory [[0]](#0), a denial of service
  (DoS) vulnerability exists in the Squid [[1]](#1) web caching proxy [[1]](#1).
  The "asn_parse_header" function in the SNMP module of Squid before
  version 2.4.STABLE7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service (server restart) via certain SNMP packets with negative
  length fields that causes a memory allocation error. The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2004-0918 [[2]](#2) to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  squid" and "<prefix>/bin/rpm -qi squid | grep with_snmp". If you have
  the "squid" package with option "with_snmp" installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade
  (see Solution) [3][[4]](#4).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [[5]](#5), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [[6]](#6) or a mirror location,
  verify its integrity [[7]](#7), build a corresponding binary RPM from it [[3]](#3)
  and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary RPM [[4]](#4).
  For the previous release OpenPKG 2.1, perform the following operations
  to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases adjust
  accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.1/UPD
  ftp> get squid-2.5.6-2.1.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig squid-2.5.6-2.1.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild squid-2.5.6-2.1.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/squid-2.5.6-2.1.1.*.rpm

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Advisory ID: SQUID-2008:1
Date: June 22, 2008
Summary: Remote denial of service in SNMP parser
Affected versions: All 3.0 versions up to 3.0.STABLE7
Fixed in version: 3.0.STABLE7

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2004-0918
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Problem Description:
Advisory 2004-3 was fixed in 2.5.STABLE7 and all later 2.x releases,
but was unfortunately not duplicated in the 3.x branch.
A bug exists in the ASN1 parser used in Squid's SNMP library. This
code fails to fully validate certain fields in SNMP queries. A
specially-crafted message may contain negative values, which Squid
passes to the malloc() function. This may lead to a segmentation
violation and cause Squid to restart.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Severity:
The bug is significant because it forces squid to restart, thus
disrupting active transactions. The buggy code is executed even
before Squid makes any access control checks (i.e. snmp\_access).
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Updated Packages:
The Squid-3.0.STABLE7 release contains a fix for this
problem. You can download the Squid-3.0.STABLE7 release from
ftp://ftp.squid-cache.org/pub/archive/3.0/
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.0/
or the mirrors (may take a while before all mirrors are updated).
For a list of mirror sites see
http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/ftp-mirrors.html
http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/http-mirrors.html
An individual patch for this issues can be found in our
patch archive for version Squid-3.0.STABLE6:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.0/changesets/b8826.patch
If necessary, this short patch should also apply to any version
of Squid 3.0 released before June 2008.
If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please
refer to the package vendor for availability information on
updated packages.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Determining if your version is vulnerable:
This bug is present by default in all 3.0 releases before
3.0.STABLE7 since SNMP support is present by default.
However, Squid is vulnerable only if it is listening for SNMP
queries on a UDP port. The default configuration in 3.0 is for
the SNMP port to be closed.
Squid is at risk unless built with configure option --disable-snmp.
You can check if squid.conf contains the 'snmp\_port' option with
a non-zero value.
Or if Squid's cache.log file contains the following message:
Accepting SNMP messages on port 3401, FD nn.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Workarounds:
The best workaround is to close Squid's SNMP port, at least
temporarily. Close SNMP port by removing the snmp\_port directive
or setting it to '0'.
Note that in 3.0 releases the default SNMP port setting is closed.
This differs form the original 2004-3 advisory.
If your SNMP agent runs on the same host as Squid, use the loopback
IP address and use a packet filter rule to block SNMP messages
from outside hosts. You can bind Squid's SNMP port to the loopback
address with this directive:
snmp\_incoming\_address 127.0.0.1
Restart or reconfigure Squid after editing squid.conf.
If your SNMP agent runs on a different host as Squid, configure
the firewall on your Squid box to only permit SNMP traffic between
your trusted agent and the Squid SNMP port.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Contact details for the Squid project:
For installation / upgrade support: Your first point of contact
should be your binary package vendor.
If your install is built from the original Squid sources, then
the squid-users@squid-cache.org mailing list is your primary
support point. (see
for subscription details).
For bug reporting, particularly security related bugs the
squid-bugs@squid-cache.org mailing list is the appropriate forum.
It's a closed list (though anyone can post) and security related
bug reports are treated in confidence until the impact has been
established. For non security related bugs, the squid bugzilla
database should be used .

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2004:3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Advisory ID: SQUID-2004:3
Date: October 5, 2004
Summary: Remote denial of service in SNMP parser
Affected versions: All versions up to and including 2.5.STABLE6
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2004\_3.txt
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2004-0918
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Problem Description:
A bug exists in the ASN1 parser used in Squid's SNMP library. This
code fails to fully validate certain fields in SNMP queries. A
specially-crafted message may contain negative values, which Squid
passes to the malloc() function. This may lead to a segmentation
violation and cause Squid to restart.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Severity:
The bug is significant because it forces squid to restart, thus
disrupting active transactions. The buggy code is executed even
before Squid makes any access control checks (i.e. snmp\_access).
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Updated Packages:
The Squid-2.5.STABLE7 release contains a fix for this
problem. You can download the Squid-2.5.STABLE7 release from
ftp://ftp.squid-cache.org/pub/archive/2.5/
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v2/2.5/
or the mirrors (may take a while before all mirrors are updated).
For a list of mirror sites see
http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/ftp-mirrors.html
http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/http-mirrors.html
An individual patch for this issues can be found in our
patch archive for version Squid-2.5.STABLE6:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v2/2.5/bugs/squid-2.5.STABLE6-SNMP\_core\_dump.patch
If necessary, this short patch should also apply to any version
of Squid released after March 1998.
If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please
refer to the package vendor for availability information on

Determining if your version is vulnerable:
This bug is present only when Squid has been compiled with SNMP
support. SNMP support must be enabled with the --enable-snmp
./configure option.
Furthermore, Squid is vulnerable only if it is listening for SNMP
queries on a UDP port. You can check Squid's cache.log file for
the following message:
Accepting SNMP messages on port 3401, FD nn.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Workarounds:
The best workaround is to disable Squid's SNMP port, at least
temporarily. Disable SNMP by setting snmp\_port to zero:
snmp\_port 0
Note that if you delete or comment out the 'snmp\_port' directive,
Squid uses the default value (3401).
If your SNMP agent runs on the same host as Squid, use the loopback
IP address and use a packet filter rule to block SNMP messages
from outside hosts. You can bind Squid's SNMP port to the loopback
address with this directive:
snmp\_incoming\_address 127.0.0.1
Restart or reconfigure Squid after editing squid.conf.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Contact details for the Squid project:
For installation / upgrade support: Your first point of contact
should be your binary package vendor.
If your install is built from the original Squid sources, then
the squid-users@squid-cache.org mailing list is your primary
support point. (see
for subscription details).
For bug reporting, particularly security related bugs the
squid-bugs@squid-cache.org mailing list is the appropriate forum.
It's a closed list (though anyone can post) and security related
bug reports are treated in confidence until the impact has been
established. For non security related bugs, the squid bugzilla
database should be used .

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- sudo not flushing stdin
This update of sudo flushes the stdin buffer on password
timeout. Unflushed buffers can lead to leaking the password via a
parent process reading stdin after sudo exits.
This issue only affects openSUSE 10.3 and was fixed there.
- courier-authlib SQL injection possibility
courier-authlib was updated to fix a bug that allowed SQL
injections. (CVE-2008-2667)
Only openSUSE 10.3 and 11.0 were affected.
- gnome-screensaver
Using gnome-screensaver an attacker could log in without a valid
password if the NIS server is down. (CVE-2008-0887)
gnome-screensaver was affected on SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE
Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 and was fixed there.
- clamav 0.93.1
Clamav was updated to version 0.93.1. It fixes various bugs and
one minor security issue:
CVE-2008-2713: libclamav/petite.c in ClamAV before 0.93.1 allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted Petite
file that triggers an out-of-bounds read.
clamav was updated on all products containing clamav.
- PHP 5 security update
php5 was updated to fix various bugs and security problems:
- possible stack-based buffer overflow CVE-2008-2050
- incomplete escapeshellcmd() CVE-2008-2051
- printf() integer overflow CVE-2008-1384
- insecure GENERATE\_SEED macro CVE-2008-2107
- timezone update for DST in Pakistan
On openSUSE 10.2 up to 11.0 php5 was updated to 5.2.6. For SUSE
Linux Enterprise 10 SP1 and SP2 the fixes were backported.
- ImageMagick, GraphicsMagick security problems
ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick were affected by two security problems:
CVE-2008-1096: Buffer overflow in the handling of XCF files
CVE-2008-1097: Heap buffer overflow in the handling of PCX files
ImageMagick was updated on all products. GraphicsMagick is only
found on openSUSE 10.3 and 11.0 and was updated there.
- mtr potential remote overflow
MTR was updated to fix a stack based buffer overflow which could
potentially be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
code (CVE-2008-2357).
mtr was updated on all SUSE Linux based products.
- bind root zone update
The IP number for the "L" root DNS server changed.
This patch updates the root.hint zone file to get the new IP number.
This is only security related and not a true vulnerability since the
old server is still operating correctly.
- pcre buffer overflow
Specially crafted regular expressions could lead to a buffer overflow
in the pcre library. Applications using pcre to process regular
expressions from untrusted sources could therefore potentially be
exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2008-2371).
Only the pcre version on openSUSE 10.3 was affected by this problem
and received fixed packages.
- tomcat55 and tomcat6 cross site scripting problem
tomcat was updated to fix a cross-site-scripting vulnerability in
the host-manager. (CVE-2008-1947)
Since the problem only affects tomcat 5.5 and tomcat 6 only those
were fixed in openSUSE 10.3 and 11.0. Other products were not
affected.
- squid denial of service problem in ASN.1 parsing
Squid was updated to fix an old denial-of-service bug that can
occur while parsing ASN.1 data. (CVE-2004-0918)
More details can be found on:
<http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2008_1.txt>
Only Squid 3.0 was affected, which is only on openSUSE 11.0 and
was fixed there.
- freetype2 various integer overflows
This update of freetype2 fixes several potential vulnerabilities
reported by iDefense.
CVE-2008-1806: Integer overflow in FreeType2 allows context-dependent
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted set of 16-bit
length values within the Private dictionary table in a Printer Font
Binary (PFB) file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
CVE-2008-1807: FreeType2 allow context-dependent attackers to execute
arbitrary code via an invalid "number of axes" field in a Printer
Font Binary (PFB) file, which triggers a free of arbitrary memory
locations, leading to memory corruption.
CVE-2008-1808: Multiple off-by-one errors in FreeType2 before 2.3.6
allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via
(1) a crafted table in a Printer Font Binary (PFB) file or (2)
a crafted SHC instruction in a TrueType Font (TTF) file, which
triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
Freetype2 was updated on all distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================

# Squid: Remote DoS vulnerability — GLSA **200410-15**

Squid contains a vulnerability in the SNMP module which may lead to a
denial of service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-proxy/squid** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5.7** |

### Background

Squid is a full-featured Web proxy cache designed to run on Unix
systems. It supports proxying and caching of HTTP, FTP, and other URLs,
as well as SSL support, cache hierarchies, transparent caching, access
control lists and many other features.

### Description

A parsing error exists in the SNMP module of Squid where a
specially-crafted UDP packet can potentially cause the server to
restart, closing all current connections. This vulnerability only
exists in versions of Squid compiled with the 'snmp' USE flag.

### Impact

An attacker can repeatedly send these malicious UDP packets to the
Squid server, leading to a denial of service.

### Workaround

Disable SNMP support or filter the port that has SNMP processing
(default is 3401) to allow only SNMP data from trusted hosts.

To disable SNMP support put the entry snmp\_port 0 in the squid.conf
configuration file.

To allow only the local interface to process SNMP, add the entry
"snmp\_incoming\_address 127.0.0.1" in the squid.conf configuration file.

### Resolution

All Squid users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-proxy/squid-2.5.7"
 # emerge ">=net-proxy/squid-2.5.7"
```
