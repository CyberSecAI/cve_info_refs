How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves a newly-discovered, privately reported vulnerability. A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Network Dynamic Data Exchange (NetDDE) services because of an unchecked buffer. The vulnerability is documented in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges. However, the NetDDE services are not started by default and would have to be manually started, or started by an application that requires NetDDE, for an attacker to attempt to remotely exploit this vulnerability.

We recommend that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Windows 98, 98 SE, ME | Windows NT 4.0 | Windows 2000 | Windows XP | Windows Server 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NetDDE Vulnerability - [CAN-2004-0206](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2004-0206) | Remote Code Execution | Not Critical\ | Important | Important | Important | Moderate |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces several prior security bulletins. The security bulletin IDs and operating systems that are affected are listed in the following table.

| Bulletin ID | Windows NT 4.0 | Windows 2000 | Windows XP | Windows Server 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [**MS02-071**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=10597) | Not Replaced | Replaced | Not Replaced | Not Applicable |
| [**MS03-045**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=18866) | Not Replaced | Replaced | Not Replaced | Not Replaced |

**Note** Both [**MS04-032**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=30428) and [**MS04-031**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=30427) security bulletins replace [**MS02-071**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=10597)and [**MS03-045**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=18866) on Windows 2000. However, the mssecure.xml file that is used by MBSA and SUS only allows one bulletin to directly replace these prior security bulletins. In this case [**MS04-032**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=30428) has been chosen as the official replacement for both of these prior security bulletins. While [**MS04-031**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=30427)does replace [**MS02-071**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=10597)and [**MS03-045**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=18866) on Windows 2000, this will not be reflected by MBSA and SUS. Additionally, [**MS04-032**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=30428) and [**MS04-031**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=30427)are not replacements for each other. Both updates must be installed to be protected from the issues documented in each of these security bulletins. However installing either of these updates for Windows 2000 will protect you from the issues documented in [**MS02-071**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=10597)and [**MS03-045**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=18866) for Windows 2000.

**I am still using Windows XP, but extended security update support ended on September 30th, 2004. However, this bulletin has a security update for this operating system version. Why is that?**

The original version of Windows XP, commonly known as Windows XP Gold or Windows XP Release to Manufacturing (RTM) version, reached the end of its extended security update support life cycle on September 30, 2004. However, the end-of-life occurred very recently. In this case, the majority of the steps that are required to address this vulnerability were completed before this date. Therefore, we have decided to release a security update for this operating system version as part of this security bulletin.

We do not anticipate doing this for future vulnerabilities that may affect this operating system version, but we reserve the right to produce updates and to make these updates available when necessary.

## Vulnerability Details

#### NetDDE Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0206:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the NetDDE services because of an unchecked buffer. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, the NetDDE services are not started by default and would have to be manually started for an attacker to attempt to remotely exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability could also be used to attempt to perform a local elevation of privilege or remote denial of service.

#### Mitigating Factors for NetDDE Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0206:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* On Windows Server 2003 the NetDDE services are disabled by default. Typically only administrators can change the startup type of a service. An attacker would first have to change the startup type from Disabled, and then start the service to attempt to exploit this vulnerability.
* Disabling the NetDDE services helps prevent the possibility of a remote attack. See the Workarounds section for instructions that describe how to disable these services. Operating systems other than Windows Server 2003 have the NetDDE services startup type set to Manual instead of Disabled by default.
* [**Chapter 6 of the Microsoft Solution for Securing Windows 2000 Server,Hardening the Base Windows 2000 Server**](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/prodtech/win2000/secwin2k/default.mspx) recommends disabling the NetDDE services. Environments that comply with these guidelines could be at a reduced risk from this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for NetDDE Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0206:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Disable the NetDDE services**

  Disabling the NetDDE services will help protect from remote attempts to exploit this vulnerability. You can disable the NetDDE services by following these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel** (or point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**).
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-click **Services**.
  4. Double-click **Network DDE**.
  5. In the **Startup type** list, click **Disabled**.
  6. Click **Stop**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Double-click **Network DDE DSDM**.
  8. In the **Startup type** list, click **Disabled**.
  9. Click **Stop**, and then click **OK**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** If the NetDDE services are disabled, messages from NetDDE applications are not transmitted. If the NetDDE services are disabled, any services that explicitly depend on the NetDDE services will not start, and an error message is logged in the system event log.
* **Use the Group Policy settings to disable NetDDE services on all affected systems that do not require this feature.**

  Because NetDDE is a possible attack vector, disable it by using the Group Policy settings. You can disable the startup of this service at either the local, site, domain or organizational unit level using Group Policy object functionality in Windows 2000 or Windows Server 2003 domain environments.

  **Note** You may also review the [Windows 2000 Hardening Guide](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=15e83186-a2c8-4c8f-a9d0-a0201f639a56&displaylang;=en). This guide includes information about how to disable services.

  For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Web sites:

  + [Step-by-Step Guide to Understanding the Group Policy Feature Set](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/directory/activedirectory/stepbystep/gpfeat.mspx)
  + [Windows 2000 Group Policy](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/howto/grpolwt.mspx)
  + [Group Policy in Windows Server 2003](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/gp/default.mspx)

  **Impact of Workaround:** If the NetDDE services are disabled, messages from NetDDE applications are not transmitted. If the NetDDE services are disabled, any services that explicitly depend on the NetDDE services will not start, and an error message is logged in the system event log.
* **Block the following at the firewall:**

  + **UDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445, and TCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593**
  + **All unsolicited inbound traffic on ports greater than 1024**
  + **Any other specifically configured RPC port**

  These ports can be used to initiate a connection to an affected system. Blocking them at the firewall will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Also, make sure that you block any other specifically configured RPC port on the remote system. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about the ports that RPC uses, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
* **Use a personal firewall such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/security/winfirewall.mspx)**, which is included with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.**

  If you use the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP or in Windows Server 2003 to help protect your Internet connection, it blocks unsolicited inbound traffic by default. We recommend blocking all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet.

  **Note** This procedure does not apply to Windows XP Service Pack 2. Windows XP Server Pack 2 is not affected by this vulnerability.

  To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

  To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
  3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  5. Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you want to enable the use of some programs and services through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, protocols, and services that are required.
* **Enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [309798](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;309798).
* **Block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and how to apply filters is available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Articles [313190](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;313190) and [813878](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=813878).

#### FAQ for NetDDE Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0206:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges. However, the NetDDE services are not started by default and would have to be manually started for an attacker to attempt to remotely exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability could also be used to attempt to perform a local elevation of privilege or remote denial of service.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the NetDDE services.

**What is Network Dynamic Data Exchange?**

Network Dynamic Data Exchange (NetDDE) allows two applications to communicate with each other over a network. This is considered an older communication method that typically has been replaced by newer technologies such as DCOM. For more information about DCOM, visit the [DCOM MSDN Web Site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms809340).

**What applications or services require NetDDE?**

NetDDE is a considered to be an older network communication method. Applications such as the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 version of Microsoft Hearts (MSHearts) and Microsoft Chat (MSChat) application use NetDDE services. The version of Microsoft Hearts that is provided as part of Windows XP does not use NetDDE Services. The Clipbook service that is used to share a local clipboard to other systems in a network and the DDE Share Manager (DDEShare) application both require the NetDDE services. There are cases when Microsoft Excel could also use NetDDE. Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [128941](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;128491) discusses how Microsoft Excel can use NetDDE. Third-party applications may also require the NetDDE services; therefore it is important to test the suggested workarounds in your organization before you deploy this update.

**How can an administrator determine if NetDDE services are running?**

Administrators can determine if the NetDDE services are running by viewing, Administrative Tools, Services, and searching for the NetDDE and the NetDDE DSDM services. The status of **Started** indicates that the services are running. See the Workarounds section of this security bulletin for instructions that explain how you can disable these services.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

After the NetDDE services are started, any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could attempt to remotely exploit this vulnerability. Operating systems other than Windows XP Service Pack2 and Windows Server 2003 have the NetDDE services set to a startup type of Manual instead of Disabled. This could allow non privileged users to start the NetDDE services or could allow them to start an application that starts the NetDDE services. After the NetDDE services are started, the affected system could be vulnerable to a remote attack. To help prevent this, see the Workaround section for instructions that explain how you can disable the NetDDE services. This vulnerability could also be used to attempt to perform a local elevation of privilege.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

After a NetDDE service is started, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted message and sending the message to an affected system, which could then cause the affected system to remotely execute code. Receipt of such a message could also cause the vulnerable system to fail in such a way that it could cause a denial of service.

To exploit this vulnerability for a local elevation of privilege, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially-designed application that could attempt to exploit the vulnerability and thereby gain complete control over the affected system.

An attacker could also access the affected component through another vector. For example, an attacker could use another program that passes parameters to the vulnerable component (locally or remotely).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers are only at risk if users are given the ability to log on and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

Windows XP Service Pack 2 is not vulnerable to this issue. Windows Server 2003 is impacted at a lower severity rating because the NetDDE services startup type is set to Disabled. An attacker would first have to change the setting from Disabled to Manual or Automatic, and then start the service to attempt to remotely exploit this vulnerability. Typically, only administrators can change the startup type of a service. Operating systems other than Windows Server 2003 have the NetDDE services set to a startup type of Manual instead of Disabled. This could allow non privileged users to start the NetDDE services or allow them to start an application that starts the NetDDE services. Once the NetDDE services are started the affected system could be vulnerable to a remote attack. To help prevent this, see the Workarounds section for instructions that explain how you can disable the NetDDE services.

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?**

No. Although Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition do contain the affected component, the vulnerability is not critical because the NetDDE service is not started by default. For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. If you have manually started the NetDDE services, or if you are using applications that may have started the NetDDE services, an attacker could attempt to remotely exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet. Microsoft has provided information about how you can help protect your PC. End users can visit the [Protect Your PC Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21169). IT Professionals can visit the [Security Center Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21171).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the NetDDE services validate the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Notes** The Windows XP and Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 versions of this security update are packaged as dual-mode packages, which contain files for both the original version of Windows XP and Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1). For more information about dual-mode packages, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [328848](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=328848).

When you install the Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 security update, the installer checks to see if any of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [824994](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=824994).

**Verifying Update Installation**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. This tool allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

### Overview

A vulnerability in the Network Dynamic Data Exchange service for Microsoft Windows could allow an attacker to compromise the affected system.

### Description

| Microsoft's Network Dynamic Data Exchange (NetDDE) is a communication protocol that allows two Windows applications to communicate with each other over a network. A buffer management flaw exists in the way that this service handles certain malformed messages. This flaw results in a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to compromise the system. According to Microsoft security bulletin [MS04-031](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-031.mspx):  A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the NetDDE services because of an unchecked buffer. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, the NetDDE services are not started by default and would have to be manually started for an attacker to attempt to remotely exploit this vulnerability. This bulletin also states:There are cases when Microsoft Excel could also use NetDDE. Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [128941](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;128491) discusses how Microsoft Excel can use NetDDE. |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges on the affected system. Microsoft reports that this vulnerability could also be used to attempt to perform a local elevation of privilege or remote denial of service. |
