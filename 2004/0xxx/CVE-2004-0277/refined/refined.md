The provided content describes a format string vulnerability in DreamFTP Server 1.02, which can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a format string bug in the DreamFTP server software. The server processes user-supplied input without proper sanitization, leading to the format string vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Format string vulnerability: User-controlled input is used as part of a format string, which allows an attacker to read and write arbitrary memory locations.
- Overwritable SEH: The exception handler code is Read/Write/Executable (RWE), allowing it to be overwritten by the attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the target machine. The provided exploit executes shellcode that opens a command shell on the target.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the FTP protocol, by sending a crafted format string as input to the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP server on the vulnerable port. The attacker can be on the same network, or on a network that can connect to the server.
