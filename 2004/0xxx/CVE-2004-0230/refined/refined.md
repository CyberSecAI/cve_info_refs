{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the affected systems not properly validating TCP packets, specifically failing to ignore certain malformed packets, leading to connection resets.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of TCP packets",
      "Failure to ignore malformed TCP packets"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can cause a denial of service by resetting existing TCP connections. This requires the affected connections to be re-established for normal communication, potentially disrupting services.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted TCP message to a vulnerable system.",
      "Requires knowledge or prediction of the IP addresses and port numbers of both ends of the existing TCP connection.",
      "Requires prediction or learning of specific difficult TCP network packet details"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to send a specially crafted TCP message to the target system, and know or predict details about the existing TCP connection to disrupt it.",
    "additional_information": "This vulnerability is also identified as CAN-2004-0230. Proof of concept code was publicly available at the time of the bulletin's release, but there were no reports of exploitation. The attack must be performed on every TCP connection targeted for reset."
