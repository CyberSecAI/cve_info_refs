## OpenSSL does not properly handle unknown message types

#### Vulnerability Note VU#465542

Original Release Date: 2004-03-17 | Last Revised: 2005-05-06

---

### Overview

OpenSSL does not properly handle unknown message types, allowing an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service. This vulnerability was addressed in OpenSSL [0.9.6d](http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=5721) and [0.9.7](http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=5722).

### Description

| [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/) implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security ([TLS](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt)) protocols and includes a general purpose cryptographic library. SSL and TLS are commonly used to provide authentication, encryption, integrity, and non-repudiation services to network applications such as HTTP, IMAP, POP3, LDAP, and others.  OpenSSL prior to version 0.9.6d does not properly handle unknown message types. An attacker could cause the application using OpenSSL to enter an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service.Further information is available in [NISCC/224012/OpenSSL/3](http://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2004/224012/index.htm). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated, remote attacker could cause a denial of service in an application that uses OpenSSL. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or Patch**This vulnerability was addressed in OpenSSL versions [0.9.6d](http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=5721) and [0.9.7](http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=5722). Upgrade to OpenSSL version 0.9.6d or 0.9.7 greater. Alternatively, upgrade or apply a patch as specified by your vendor. Note that it is necessary to recompile any applications that are statically linked to OpenSSL libraries. |

               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated OpenSSL resolves security vulnerability
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1395
Issue date:        2004-05-08
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Security
Cross references:  <https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1395>
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0851 CAN-2004-0081
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated OpenSSL packages that fix remote denial of service vulnerabilities
are now available.

2. Relevent releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386 i686
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386 i686
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386 i686

3. Problem description:

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and
Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.

Testing performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool
uncovered a bug in older versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 prior to 0.9.6d that
can lead to a denial of service attack (infinite loop).  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0081 to this issue.

Testing performed by Novell using a test suite provided by NISCC uncovered
an issue in the ASN.1 parser in versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 prior to 0.9.6l
which could cause large recursion and possibly lead to a denial of service
attack if used where stack space is limited.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0851
to this issue.

These updated packages contain patches provided by the OpenSSL group that
protect against these issues.

NOTE: Because server applications are affected by this issue, users are
advised to either restart all services using OpenSSL functionality or
restart their system after installing these updated packages.

Fedora Legacy would like to thank Michal Jaegermann for bringing this issue
to our attention.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit
<http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs> for directions on how to configure yum
and apt-get.

# Multiple OpenSSL Vulnerabilities — GLSA **200403-03**

Three vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL via a commercial test
suite for the TLS protocol developed by Codenomicon Ltd.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.9.7c** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.7d**= **0.9.6m** |

### Background

The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing
the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS
v1) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography
library.

### Description

1. Testing performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test
   Tool uncovered a null-pointer assignment in the do\_change\_cipher\_spec()
   function. A remote attacker could perform a carefully crafted SSL/TLS
   handshake against a server that used the OpenSSL library in such a way
   as to cause OpenSSL to crash. Depending on the application this could
   lead to a denial of service. All versions of OpenSSL from 0.9.6c to
   0.9.6l inclusive and from 0.9.7a to 0.9.7c inclusive are affected by
   this issue.
2. A flaw has been discovered in SSL/TLS handshaking code when using
   Kerberos ciphersuites. A remote attacker could perform a carefully
   crafted SSL/TLS handshake against a server configured to use Kerberos
   ciphersuites in such a way as to cause OpenSSL to crash. Most
   applications have no ability to use Kerberos cipher suites and will
   therefore be unaffected. Versions 0.9.7a, 0.9.7b, and 0.9.7c of OpenSSL
   are affected by this issue.
3. Testing performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test
   Tool uncovered a bug in older versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 that can lead
   to a Denial of Service attack (infinite loop). This issue was traced to
   a fix that was added to OpenSSL 0.9.6d some time ago. This issue will
   affect vendors that ship older versions of OpenSSL with backported
   security patches.

### Impact

Although there are no public exploits known for bug, users are
recommended to upgrade to ensure the security of their infrastructure.

### Workaround

There is no immediate workaround; a software upgrade is required. The
vulnerable function in the code has been rewritten.

### Resolution

All users are recommened to upgrade openssl to either 0.9.7d or 0.9.6m:

```
 # emerge sync
 # emerge -pv ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.7d"
 # emerge ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.7d"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHSA-2004:119 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2004-03-17
Updated:
2004-03-17
# RHSA-2004:119 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

openssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated OpenSSL packages that fix a remote denial of service vulnerability
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and
Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.

Testing performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool
uncovered a bug in older versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 prior to 0.9.6d that can
lead to a denial of service attack (infinite loop). The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0081 to this issue.

Testing performed by Novell using a test suite provided by NISCC uncovered
an issue in the ASN.1 parser in versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 prior to 0.9.6l
which could cause large recursion and possibly lead to a denial of service
attack if used where stack space is limited. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0851
to this issue.

These updated packages contain patches provided by the OpenSSL group that
protect against these issues.

NOTE: Because server applications are affected by this issue, users are
advised to either restart all services using OpenSSL functionality or
restart their system after installing these updated packages.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade. Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated. Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated. Note that you
can also use wildcards (\*.rpm) if your current directory \*only\* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network. Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate. The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt>

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2 ia64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2 i386
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 2 ia64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 2 i386

## Fixes

* [BZ - 117771](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=117771)
