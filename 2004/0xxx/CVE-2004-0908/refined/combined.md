Text fields accept script-generated events. You cannot send Ctrl-C - this is a
menu shortcut, so untrusted events will be rejected. But you can send Ctrl-Ins,
which is implemented in the text field itself. This way you can put every text
you want into the user's clipboard. And you can send Shift-Ins to insert
whatever you have in your clipboard into the text field.
I've tested this on Windows but it should work as well at least with KDE, it has
same shortcuts.

These shortcuts are defined in
content/xbl/builtin/(win|unix)/platformHTMLBindings.xml. XBL only rejects
non-trusted events for chrome content but these text fields are not chrome...

Severity critical, because I keep copy&pasting passwords, assume others do as well.
Reproduced both read and write on Mozilla 1.7.x branch on Linux. Only works when
I copied using the explicit "CLIPBOARD" (via menu, shortcut etc.), not the
"PRIMARY" clipboard (just select).

This prevents commands from being triggered by non-trusted events, even if the
widget itself isn't trusted.

Since there's another (mType & NS\_HANDLER\_TYPE\_XBL\_COMMAND) a few lines down
you could define isXBLCommand like isXULKey above for readability. Or not --

Is there anything that could be legitimately relying on the old behavior? I was
thinking of some sort of QA test harness poking in events, but I guess a chrome
app could create trusted events for that.

The test cases still work (i.e. the bug still exists) for me in Linux with the
GTK2/XFT nightly builds of both Mozilla and Firefox; however, it does seems
fixed with the GTK1 builds.

Just a guess - is this because of [bug 257405](/show_bug.cgi?id=257405 "VERIFIED FIXED - Use gtk2 native keybindings for input and textarea")?

Looking at the patch - this seems to be the case. DOMEventToNativeKeyEvent()
should return PR\_FALSE for non-trusted events.

This fixes the regression caused by [bug 257405](/show_bug.cgi?id=257405 "VERIFIED FIXED - Use gtk2 native keybindings for input and textarea"). AFAICT this is the only place

I only see Ctrl-Ins and Shift-Ins mentioned.
Are we taking care of "Shift-Del" which is equivalent to ctrl-x
Also if we can get a test case, it will be great help.

## Mozilla fails to properly handle script-generated events

#### Vulnerability Note VU#460528

Original Release Date: 2004-09-17 | Last Revised: 2004-09-17

---

### Overview

There is a vulnerability the way Mozilla handles script-generated events that could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to access data contained on the victim's clipboard.

### Description

| [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/) is an open-source web browser, email/newsgroup client, IRC client, and HTML editor available for a number of platforms including Microsoft Windows, Linux, and other UNIX platforms. When a web page is loaded by the browser, it will accept certain JavaScript events to control behavior on the page. These script-generated events can be applied to text fields.  There is a vulnerability in the way Mozilla handles copy/paste keyboard shortcut sequences sent to text fields using JavaScript. While Mozilla restricts the use of copy (Ctrl+C) and paste (Ctrl+V) keyboard shortcut sequences, it fails to restrict other variations such as Ctrl+Ins (copy) and Shift+Ins (paste). Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to access the victim's clipboard. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a victim to view a malicious web page, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could perform read/write operations to the victim's clipboard. Since users may copy/paste usernames, passwords, or potentially other sensitive information to the clipboard, the attacker could gain access to this information. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**Upgrade as specified by your vendor. This issue has been resolved in Mozilla 1.7.3, Firefox Preview Release, and Thunderbird 0.8. |
| --- |

| **Disable JavaScript**Disable JavaScript in your browser's preferences. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Background

Mozilla is a popular web browser that includes a mail and newsreader.
Epiphany is a web browser that uses Gecko, the Mozilla rendering
engine. Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird are respectively the
next-generation browser and mail client from the Mozilla project.

### Description

Mozilla-based products are vulnerable to multiple security issues.
Firstly routines handling the display of BMP images and VCards contain
an integer overflow and a stack buffer overrun. Specific pages with
long links, when sent using the "Send Page" function, and links with
non-ASCII hostnames could both cause heap buffer overruns.

Several issues were found and fixed in JavaScript rights handling:
untrusted script code could read and write to the clipboard, signed
scripts could build confusing grant privileges dialog boxes, and when
dragged onto trusted frames or windows, JavaScript links could access
information and rights of the target frame or window. Finally,
Mozilla-based mail clients (Mozilla and Mozilla Thunderbird) are
vulnerable to a heap overflow caused by invalid POP3 mail server
responses.

### Impact

An attacker might be able to run arbitrary code with the rights of the
user running the software by enticing the user to perform one of the
following actions: view a specially-crafted BMP image or VCard, use the
"Send Page" function on a malicious page, follow links with malicious
hostnames, drag multiple JavaScript links in a row to another window,
or connect to an untrusted POP3 mail server. An attacker could also use
a malicious page with JavaScript to disclose clipboard contents or
abuse previously-given privileges to request XPI installation
privileges through a confusing dialog.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround covering all vulnerabilities.

### Resolution

All users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv your-version
 # emerge your-version
```

1. Topic:

Updated mozilla, galeon and epiphany packages that fix multiple
vulnerabilities are now available.

Mozilla is an open-source Web browser, designed for standards
compliance, performance, and portability.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

Note that some of these issues have already been fixed in Redhat 9 and
Fedora Core 1. Please refer to previous advisories for details.

NISCC testing of implementations of the S/MIME protocol uncovered a number
of bugs in NSS versions prior to 3.9. The parsing of unexpected ASN.1
constructs within S/MIME data could cause Mozilla to crash or consume large
amounts of memory. A remote attacker could potentially trigger these bugs
by sending a carefully-crafted S/MIME message to a victim. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0564 to this issue.

Andreas Sandblad discovered a cross-site scripting issue that affects
various versions of Mozilla. When linking to a new page it is still
possible to interact with the old page before the new page has been
successfully loaded. Any Javascript events will be invoked in the context
of the new page, making cross-site scripting possible if the different
pages belong to different domains. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0191 to
this issue.

Flaws have been found in the cookie path handling between a number of Web
browsers and servers. The HTTP cookie standard allows a Web server
supplying a cookie to a client to specify a subset of URLs on the origin
server to which the cookie applies. Web servers such as Apache do not
filter returned cookies and assume that the client will only send back
cookies for requests that fall within the server-supplied subset of URLs.
However, by supplying URLs that use path traversal (/../) and character
encoding, it is possible to fool many browsers into sending a cookie to a
path outside of the originally-specified subset. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0594 to this issue.

Zen Parse reported improper input validation to the SOAPParameter object
constructor leading to an integer overflow and controllable heap
corruption. Malicious JavaScript could be written to utilize this flaw and
could allow arbitrary code execution. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0722 to
this issue.

During a source code audit, Chris Evans discovered a buffer overflow and
integer overflows which affect the libpng code inside Mozilla. An attacker
could create a carefully crafted PNG file in such a way that it would cause
Mozilla to crash or execute arbitrary code when the image was viewed.
(CAN-2004-0597, CAN-2004-0599)

Zen Parse reported a flaw in the POP3 capability. A malicious POP3 server
could send a carefully crafted response that would cause a heap overflow
and potentially allow execution of arbitrary code as the user running
Mozilla. (CAN-2004-0757)

Marcel Boesch found a flaw that allows a CA certificate to be imported with
a DN the same as that of the built-in CA root certificates, which can cause
a denial of service to SSL pages, as the malicious certificate is treated
as invalid. (CAN-2004-0758)

Met - Martin Hassman reported a flaw in Mozilla that could allow malicious
Javascript code to upload local files from a users machine without
requiring confirmation. (CAN-2004-0759)

Mindlock Security reported a flaw in ftp URI handling. By using a NULL
character (%00) in a ftp URI, Mozilla can be confused into opening a
resource as a different MIME type. (CAN-2004-0760)

Mozilla does not properly prevent a frame in one domain from injecting
content into a frame that belongs to another domain, which facilitates
website spoofing and other attacks, also known as the frame injection
vulnerability. (CAN-2004-0718)

Tolga Tarhan reported a flaw that can allow a malicious webpage to use a
redirect sequence to spoof the security lock icon that makes a webpage
appear to be encrypted. (CAN-2004-0761)

Jesse Ruderman reported a security issue that affects a number of browsers
including Mozilla that could allow malicious websites to install arbitrary
extensions by using interactive events to manipulate the XPInstall Security
dialog box. (CAN-2004-0762)

Emmanouel Kellinis discovered a caching flaw in Mozilla which allows
malicious websites to spoof certificates of trusted websites via
redirects and Javascript that uses the "onunload" method. (CAN-2004-0763)

Mozilla allowed malicious websites to hijack the user interface via the
"chrome" flag and XML User Interface Language (XUL) files. (CAN-2004-0764)

The cert_TestHostName function in Mozilla only checks the hostname portion
of a certificate when the hostname portion of the URI is not a fully
qualified domain name (FQDN). This flaw could be used for spoofing if an
attacker had control of machines on a default DNS search path. (CAN-2004-0765)

Jesse Ruderman discovered a cross-domain scripting bug in Mozilla. If
a user is tricked into dragging a javascript link into another frame or
page, it becomes possible for an attacker to steal or modify sensitive
information from that site. Additionally, if a user is tricked into
dragging two links in sequence to another window (not frame), it is
possible for the attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0905 to this issue.

Gael Delalleau discovered an integer overflow which affects the BMP
handling code inside Mozilla. An attacker could create a carefully crafted
BMP file in such a way that it would cause Mozilla to crash or execute
arbitrary code when the image is viewed. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0904 to
this issue.

Georgi Guninski discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the vCard
display routines. An attacker could create a carefully crafted vCard file
in such a way that it would cause Mozilla to crash or execute arbitrary
code when viewed. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0903 to this issue.

Wladimir Palant discovered a flaw in the way javascript interacts with
the clipboard. It is possible that an attacker could use malicious
javascript code to steal sensitive data which has been copied into the
clipboard. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0908 to this issue.

Georgi Guninski discovered a heap based buffer overflow in the "Send
Page" feature. It is possible that an attacker could construct a link in
such a way that a user attempting to forward it could result in a crash or
arbitrary code execution. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0902 to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit
<http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs/> for directions on how to configure yum
and apt-get.
