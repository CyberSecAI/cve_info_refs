- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Windows Media Player control, when used to preview media files, doesn't properly handle URLs with unusual protocols within ASX playlist files. Specifically, it executes Javascript code embedded within an ASX file when that file is previewed in the left panel of Windows Explorer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper handling of URLs in ASX playlist files
    - Execution of script code from media files
    - Use of Windows Media Player control within Windows Explorer to preview media files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary Javascript code execution within the local zone, which could lead to arbitrary actions with the user's privileges.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Specially crafted ASX file containing a Javascript URL.
    - User previews the file in the Explorer preview panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to create or modify an ASX playlist file.
    - Ability to get the user to open the ASX file using Windows Explorer's preview panel.
