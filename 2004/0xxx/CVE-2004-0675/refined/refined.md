- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Cart32 application does not properly validate user-supplied input in the `cart32` parameter of the `GetLatestBuilds` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the vulnerable script path (`cart32.exe` or `c32web.exe`) and appends a malicious JavaScript payload to the `cart32` parameter of the `GetLatestBuilds` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL, which they can then send to a victim or host on a website the victim is likely to visit. The user must click the crafted link.
