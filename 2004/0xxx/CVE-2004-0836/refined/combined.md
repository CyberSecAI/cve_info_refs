# MySQL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200410-22**

Several vulnerabilities including privilege abuse, Denial of Service, and
potentially remote arbitrary code execution have been discovered in MySQL.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/mysql** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.21** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.21** |

### Background

MySQL is a popular open-source, multi-threaded, multi-user SQL database
server.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in MySQL:

Oleksandr Byelkin found that ALTER TABLE ... RENAME checks CREATE/INSERT
rights of the old table instead of the new one (CAN-2004-0835). Another
privilege checking bug allowed users to grant rights on a database they had
no rights on.

Dean Ellis found a defect where multiple threads ALTERing the MERGE tables
to change the UNION could cause the server to crash (CAN-2004-0837).
Another crash was found in MATCH ... AGAINST() queries with missing closing
double quote.

Finally, a buffer overrun in the mysql\_real\_connect function was found by
Lukasz Wojtow (CAN-2004-0836).

### Impact

The privilege checking issues could be used by remote users to bypass their
rights on databases. The two crashes issues could be exploited by a remote
user to perform a Denial of Service attack on MySQL server. The buffer
overrun issue could also be exploited as a Denial of Service attack, and
may allow to execute arbitrary code with the rights of the MySQL daemon
(typically, the "mysql" user).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MySQL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=dev-db/mysql-4.0.21"
 # emerge ">=dev-db/mysql-4.0.21"
```

Description:
I'm not quite sure if it's a bug, so forgive me if it's not. In mysql_real_connect() is the following code:
    hp = my_gethostbyname_r(host,&tmp_hostent,buff2.buff,sizeof(buff2),
			      &tmp_errno);
    [ ... ]
    memcpy(&sock_addr.sin_addr,hp->h_addr, (size_t) hp->h_length);

As far as i looked my_gethostbyname_r() doesn't check if hp->h_length is more than size of sock_addr.sin_addr. Malicious user can make mysql connection to a host which dns is under his own control. This way hp->h_addr could be much larger than sin_addr and buffer overflow occurs. As it is only possible in condition when the user is able to make connection to any server, this bug's severity is not very big, but can be used to break PHP's safe mode (and possibly others)

How to repeat:
Try to connect to host: anyname.anydomain.com where dns responsible for resolving this name sends too big answer. By some chance returned address will be copied to small sock_addr.sin_addr.

Suggested fix:
Checking for length should work.

Hi,

I was unable to produce an overrun when using a very long IP ADDR, do you have a repeatable case for
this one?

Thank You!
```

Lukasz Wojtow
```
Everything depends on library you use. In glibc there is a limitation for an IP address to have only 4 bytes (obviously), but generally speaking the length of the address comes with a response for dns query (i know it sounds funny but read rfc1035 if you don't believe). This bug can occur on libraries where gethostbyname function takes length from dns's response and puts it to h_length. see sources for ping and squid (just do grep for 'gethostbyname' and look a few lines lower) to see how it should be done. doing thing like memcpy(&sa.sin_addr,he->h_addr,he->h_length) is like strncpy(buffer,user_input,strlen(user_input)). It is an overflow, just not exploitable on Linux (glibc) and OpenBSD (i don't know about others).

I couldn't reproduce it, but it is theoretically possible to overflow the buffer and it would not hurt in any
case to put a check for the size.

Thank you for your bug report. This issue has been committed to our
source repository of that product and will be incorporated into the
next release.

If necessary, you can access the source repository and build the latest
available version, including the bugfix, yourself. More information
about accessing the source trees is available at
    http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Installing_source_tree.html

Additional info:

Thank you a lot for noticing this problem and providing a very thorough explanation!
I have just fixed it like this
      memcpy(&sock_addr.sin_addr,hp->h_addr,
             min(sizeof(sock_addr.sin_addr), (size_t) hp->h_length));
And I have checked all code and there is no occurence of that problem elsewhere.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
