  "CVE-2004-0836": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the mysql_real_connect function of MySQL. This flaw occurs because the function does not properly validate the length of the host address during the connection process. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a DNS response with a larger-than-expected address, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient bounds checking on the length of the host address in the `mysql_real_connect` function.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) and potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the MySQL daemon (typically the 'mysql' user).",
       "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by controlling the DNS resolution of the target MySQL server.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or manipulate DNS responses to provide a malicious response with a larger-than-expected address. This would typically involve some level of network position or control over DNS resolution."
