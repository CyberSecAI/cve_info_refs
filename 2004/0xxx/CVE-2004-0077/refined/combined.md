Synopsis: Linux kernel do\_mremap VMA limit local privilege escalation
vulnerability
Product: Linux kernel
Version: 2.2 up to and including 2.2.25, 2.4 up to to and including 2.4.24,
2.6 up to to and including 2.6.2
Vendor: http://www.kernel.org/
URL: http://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0014-mremap-unmap.txt
CVE: CAN-2004-0077
Author: Paul Starzetz
Date: March 1, 2004
Issue:
======
A critical security vulnerability has been found in the Linux kernel memory
management code inside the mremap(2) system call due to missing function return
value check. This bug is completely unrelated to the mremap bug disclosed on
05-01-2004 except concerning the same internal kernel function code.
Details:
========
The Linux kernel manages a list of user addressable valid memory locations on a
per process basis. Every process owns a single linked list of so called virtual
memory area descriptors (called from now on just VMAs). Every VMA describes the
start of a valid memory region, its length and moreover various memory flags
like page protection.
Every VMA in the list corresponds to a part of the process's page table. The
page table contains descriptors (in short page table entries PTEs) of physical
memory pages seen by the process. The VMA descriptor can be thus understood as a
high level description of a particular region of the process's page table
storing PTE properties like page R/W flag and so on.
The mremap() system call provides resizing (shrinking or growing) as well as
moving of existing virtual memory areas or any of its parts across process's
addressable space.
Moving a part of the virtual memory from inside a VMA area to a new location
requires creation of a new VMA descriptor as well as copying the underlying page
table entries described by the VMA from the old to the new location in the
process's page table.
To accomplish this task the do\_mremap code calls the do\_munmap() internal kernel
function to remove any potentially existing old memory mapping in the new
location as well as to remove the old virtual memory mapping. Unfortunately the
code doesn't test the return value of the do\_munmap() function which may fail if
the maximum number of available VMA descriptors has been exceeded. This happens
if one tries to unmap middle part of an existing memory mapping and the
process's limit on the number of VMAs has been reached (which is currently
65535).
One of the possible situations can be illustrated with the following picture.
The corresponding page table entries (PTEs) have been marked with o and x:
Before mremap():
(oooooooooooooooooooooooo) (xxxxxxxxxxxx)
[----------VMA1----------] [----VMA2----]
[REMAPPED-VMA] <---------------|
After mremap() without VMA limit:
(oooo)(xxxxxxxxxxxx)(oooo)
[VMA3][REMAPPED-VMA][VMA4]
After mremap() but VMA limit:
(ooooxxxxxxxxxxxxxxoooo)
[---------VMA1---------]
[REMAPPED-VMA]
After the maximum number of VMAs in the process's VMA list has been reached
do\_munmap() will refuse to create the necessary VMA hole because it would split
the original VMA in two disjoint VMA areas exceeding the VMA descriptor limit.
Due to the missing return value check after trying to unmap the middle of the
VMA1 (this is the first invocation of do\_munmap inside do\_mremap code) the
corresponding page table entries from VMA2 are still inserted into the page
table location described by VMA1 thus being subject to VMA1 page protection
flags. It must be also mentioned that the original PTEs in the VMA1 are lost
thus leaving the corresponding page frames unusable for ever.
The kernel also tries to insert the overlapping VMA area into the VMA descriptor
list but this fails due to further checks in the low level VMA manipulation
code. The low level VMA list check in the 2.4 and 2.6 kernel versions just call
BUG() therefore terminating the malicious process.
There are also two other unchecked calls to do\_munmap() inside the do\_mremap()
code and we believe that the second occurrence of unchecked do\_munmap is also
exploitable. The second occurrence takes place if the VMA to be remapped is
beeing truncated in place. Note that do\_munmap can also fail on an exceptional
low memory condition while trying to allocate a VMA descriptor.
Exploitation:
=============
The vulnerability turned out to be very easily exploitable. Our first guess was
to move PTEs from one VMA mapping a read-only file (like /etc/passwd) to another
writeable VMA. This approach failed because after the BUG() macro has been
invoked the mmap semaphore of the memory descriptor is left in a closed (that is
down\_write()) state thus preventing any further memory operations which acquire
the semaphore in other clone threads.
So our attention came over the page table cache code which was introduced early
in the 2.4 series but not enabled by default. Kernels later than the 2.4.19
enable the page table cache. The basic idea of a page table cache is to keep
free page frames recently used for the page tables in a linked list to speed up
the allocation of new page tables.
On Linux every process owns a reference to a memory descriptor (mm\_struct) which
contains a pointer to a page directory. The page directory is a single page
frame (we describe the 4kb sized pages case without PAE) containing 1024
pointers to the page tables. A single page table page on the i386 architecture
holds 1024 PTEs describing up to 4MB of process's virtual memory. A single PTE
contains the physical address of the page mapped at the PTE's virtual address
and the page access rights.
The page tables are allocated on demand if a page fault occurs. They are also
freed and the corresponding page frames released to the memory manager if a
process unmaps parts of its virtual memory spanning at least one page table page
that is a region containing at least a 4MB sized and 4MB aligned memory area.
There are two paths if a new page table must be allocated: the slow and the fast
one. The fast path takes one page from the head of the page table cache while
the slow one just calls get\_free\_page(). This works well if the pages from the
page table cache have been properly cleared before inserting them into the
cache. Normally the page tables are cleared by zap\_page\_range() which is called
from do\_munmap. It is very important for the proper operation of the Linux
memory management that all locations of the process's page table actually
containing a valid PTE are covered by the corresponding VMA descriptor.
In the case of the unchecked do\_munmap inside the mremap code we have found a
condition leaving a part of the page table uncovered by a VMA. The offending
code is:
[269] if (old\_len >= new\_len) {
do\_munmap(current->mm, addr+new\_len, old\_len - new\_len);
if (!(flags & MREMAP\_FIXED) || (new\_addr == addr))
goto out;
}
This piece of code is responsible for truncating the VMA the user wants to remap
in place. It can be easily seen that do\_munmap will fail if [addr+new\_len,
addr+new\_len + (old\_len-new\_len)] goes into the middle of a VMA and the maximum
number of allowed VMA descriptors has been already used by the process. That
means also that the page table will still contain valid PTEs from addr+new\_len
on. Later in the mremap code a part of the corresponding VMA is moved and
truncated:
[179] if (!move\_page\_tables(current->mm, new\_addr, addr, old\_len)) {
unsigned long vm\_locked = vma->vm\_flags & VM\_LOCKED;
if (allocated\_vma) {
\*new\_vma = \*vma;
new\_vma->vm\_start = new\_addr;
new\_vma->vm\_end = new\_addr+new\_len;
new\_vma->vm\_pgoff += (addr-vma->vm\_start) >> PAGE\_SHIFT;
but more PTEs (namely old\_len) than the length of the created VMA are moved from
the old location if a new location has been specified along with the
MREMAP\_MAYMOVE flag. This works well only if the previous do\_munmap did not
fail. This situation can be illustrated as follows:
before mremap:
<-- old\_len -->
(oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo)
[------|-----VMA1-----|------]
|---------------------------------> new\_addr
after mremap, no VMA limit:
new\_len
(oooooo) (oooooo) (oooooo)
[-VMA1-] [-VMA3-] [-VMA2-]
after mremap but VMA limit:
new\_len [\*]
(oooooo oooooo) (oooooo)ooooooooo
[-----------VMA1-------------] [-VMA2-]
Those [\*] 'ownerless' PTE entries in the page table can be further exploited
since the memory manager has lost track of them. If the process now unmaps a
sufficiently big area of memory covering those ownerless PTEs, the underlying
page table frame will be inserted into the page table cache but will still
contain valid PTEs. That means that on the next page table frame allocation
inside process P for an address A our PTEs will appear in the page table of the
process P! If that process tries to access the virtual memory at the address A
there won't be also a page fault if the PTEs have appropriate (read or write)
access rights. In other words: through the page table cache we are able to
insert any data into the virtual memory space of another process.
Our code takes the way through a setuid binary, however this is not the only one
possibility. We prepare the page table cache so that there is a single empty
page frame in front of the cache and then a special page table containing 'self
executing' pages. To fully understand how it works we must dig into the execve()
system call.
If an user calls execve() the kernel removes all traces of the current
executable including the virtual memory areas and page tables allocated to the
process. Then a new VMA for the stack on top of the virtual memory is created
where the program environment and arguments to the new binary are stored (they
have been preserved in kernel memory). This causes a first page table frame to
be allocated for the virtual memory region ranging from 0xbfc00000-0xc0000000.
As next the .text and .data sections of the binary to be executed as well as the
program interpreter responsible for further loading are mapped into the fresh
virtual memory space. For the ELF linking format this is usually the ld.so
dynamic linker. At this point the kernel does not allocate the underlying page
tables. Only VMA descriptors are inserted into the process's VMA list.
After doing some more work not important for the following the kernel transfers
control to the dynamic linker to execute the binary. This causes a second page
fault and triggers demand loading of the first code page of the dynamic linker.
On a standard Linux kernel this will also allocate a page frame for the page
table ranging from 0x40000000 to 0x40400000.
On a kernel with page table cache enabled both allocations will take page frames
from the cache first. That means that if the second page in the cached page list
contains valid PTEs those could appear instead of the regular dynamic linker
code. It is easy to place the PTEs so that they will shadow the code section of
the dynamic linker. Note that the first PTE entry of a page is used by the cache
code to maintain the page list. In our code we populate the page table cache
with special frames containing PTEs to pages with a short shell code at the end
of the page and fill the pages with a NOP landing zone.
We must also mention that the first mremap hole disclosed on 05-01-2004 can be
also very easily exploited through the page table cache. Details are left for
the skilled reader.
A second possibility to exploit the mremap bug is to create another VMA covering
ownerless PTEs from a read-only file like /etc/passwd.
Impact:
=======
Since no special privileges are required to use the mremap(2) system call any
process may use its unexpected behavior to disrupt the kernel memory management
subsystem.
Proper exploitation of this vulnerability leads to local privilege escalation
giving an attacker full super-user privileges. The vulnerability may also lead
to a denial-of-service attack on the available system memory.
Tested and known to be vulnerable kernel versions are all <= 2.2.25, <= 2.4.24
and <= 2.6.2. The 2.2.25 version of Linux kernel does not recognize the
MREMAP\_FIXED flag but this does not prevent the bug from being successfully
exploited. All users are encouraged to patch all vulnerable systems as soon as
appropriate vendor patches are released. There is no hotfix for this
vulnerability. Limited per user virtual memory still permits do\_munmap() to
fail.

### Background

The Linux kernel is responsible for memory management in a working
system - to allow this, processes are allowed to allocate and
unallocate memory.

### Description

The memory subsystem allows for shrinking, growing, and moving of
chunks of memory along any of the allocated memory areas which the
kernel posesses.

To accomplish this, the do\_mremap code calls the do\_munmap() kernel
function to remove any old memory mappings in the new location - but,
the code doesn't check the return value of the do\_munmap() function
which may fail if the maximum number of available virtual memory area
descriptors has been exceeded.

Due to the missing return value check after trying to unmap the middle
of the first memory area, the corresponding page table entries from the
second new area are inserted into the page table locations described by
the first old one, thus they are subject to page protection flags of
the first area. As a result, arbitrary code can be executed.

### Impact

Arbitrary code with normal non-super-user privelerges may be able to
exploit this vulnerability and may disrupt the operation of other parts
of the kernel memory management subroutines finally leading to
unexpected behavior.

Since no special privileges are required to use the mremap() and
mummap() system calls any process may misuse this unexpected behavior
to disrupt the kernel memory management subsystem. Proper exploitation
of this vulnerability may lead to local privilege escalation allowing
for the execution of arbitrary code with kernel level root access.

Proof-of-concept exploit code has been created and successfully tested,
permitting root escalation on vulnerable systems. As a result, all
users should upgrade their kernels to new or patched versions.

### Workaround

Users who are unable to upgrade their kernels may attempt to use
"sysctl -w vm.max\_map\_count=1000000", however, this is a temporary fix
which only solves the problem by increasing the number of memory areas
that can be created by each process. Because of the static nature of
this workaround, it is not recommended and users are urged to upgrade
their systems to the latest avaiable patched sources.

### Resolution

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest available sources for
their system:

```
 # emerge sync
 # emerge -pv your-favourite-sources
 # emerge your-favourite-sources
 # # Follow usual procedure for compiling and installing a kernel.
 # # If you use genkernel, run genkernel as you would do normally.

 # # IF YOUR KERNEL IS MARKED as "remerge required!" THEN
 # # YOU SHOULD UPDATE YOUR KERNEL EVEN IF PORTAGE
 # # REPORTS THAT THE SAME VERSION IS INSTALLED.
```

## Linux kernel mremap(2) system call does not properly check return value from do\_munmap() function

#### Vulnerability Note VU#981222

Original Release Date: 2004-03-10 | Last Revised: 2004-03-25

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the Linux mremap(2) system call could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Description

| The Linux kernel uses a linked list of vitrual memory area (VMA) descriptors to reference valid regions of the page table for a given process. VMA descriptors include information about the memory area such as start address, length, and page protection flags. A VMA effectively contains a range of page table entries (PTEs) that make up part of the page table.  The mremap(2) system call has the ability to resize or move a VMA or part of a VMA within a process' memory space. mremap(2) contains a function called do\_munmap() that is used to unmap regions of memory during resize or move operations. There is a limit on the number of VMA descriptors that can exist at one time, and do\_munmap() does not create a new VMA descriptor if doing so would exceed this limit.In certain cases, mremap(2) does not properly check the return value from the do\_munmap() function, and will map PTEs to new locations even though the expected VMAs have not been created or updated. By carefully manipulating VMA to PTE relationships, a local attacker can read from or write to memory owned by a process running with different privileges.Further technical details are available in an [advisory](http://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0014-mremap-unmap.txt) from iSEC. Note that this vulnerability is distinct from the one described in VU#490620/CAN-2003-0985. |

### Impact

| An authenticated, local attacker could execute arbitrary code with root privileges. |

### Solution

| **Patch or Upgrade**Apply a patch or upgrade as specified by your vendor. This issue is resolved in Linux kernels [2.2.26](http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.2/ChangeLog-2.2.26), [2.4.25](http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/ChangeLog-2.4.25), and [2.6.3](http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ChangeLog-2.6.3) from the [Linux Kernel Archives](http://www.kernel.org/). |

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

No supported release of Openwall GNU/\*/Linux (Owl) was affected by this vulnerability as of the time it was made public. We had the bug proactively fixed in Owl 1.1 release (Linux kernel 2.4.23-ow2), not realizing its full security impact at the time.

Although those are no longer a part of Owl (not in Owl 1.1), we continue to maintain security hardening patches for Linux 2.2.x kernels and make them available for the public. Linux 2.2.x was affected by a variation of this vulnerability and thus, as a service to the community, we had included a workaround in Linux 2.2.25-ow2 patch. Linux 2.2.26 now includes the same change.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

I noticed in RedHat's advisory for this vuln, they also addressed 3 other vulns.  One (CAN-2004-0003) was fixed in 2.4.22.  The others (CAN-2004-0010 and CAN-2004-0075) are present in the gentoo-sources-2.4.22-r7 kernel that was just released.  CAN-2004-0003 is a vuln in ncpfs.  CAN-2004-0075 is a vuln in the Vicam USB driver.  They still show up as reserved at cve.mitre.org.  I will attach patches for both from the latest kernel (RedHat uses these same patches).  They both apply cleanly to the gentoo-sources-2.4.22-r7 kernel currently in Portage.  The ncpfs fix is not trivial but it works fine in my testing.  Sorry I haven't tried any other kernels.  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  antiher0    2004-02-18 14:02:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 25878](attachment.cgi?id=25878 "Vicam USB driver patch for CAN-2004-0075") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=25878&action=edit "Vicam USB driver patch for CAN-2004-0075"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=25878&action=diff "Vicam USB driver patch for CAN-2004-0075")] Vicam USB driver patch for CAN-2004-0075  Vicam USB driver patch for CAN-2004-0075 ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  antiher0    2004-02-18 14:02:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 25879](attachment.cgi?id=25879 "ncpfs patch for CAN-2004-0010") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=25879&action=edit "ncpfs patch for CAN-2004-0010"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=25879&action=diff "ncpfs patch for CAN-2004-0010")] ncpfs patch for CAN-2004-0010  ncpfs patch for CAN-2004-0010 ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Tim Yamin (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-02-18 14:07:38 UTC  ``` Brian, could you please put these other two patches in -r8 whenever you'll release it? Thanks. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  antiher0    2004-02-19 14:15:57 UTC  ``` Wheee!  More security patches to throw at you. :(  After digging through the source, I've found that CAN-2004-0003 is incorrect when it states that the Rage 128 DRM driver vuln was fixed in 2.4.22.  It was really fixed in the latest 2.4.25 kernel.  In other words, the latest gentoo-sources-2.4.22-r7 is vulnerable.  I will attach the patch used by both the mainline kernel and RedHat, made to apply against gentoo-sources-2.4.22-r7.  Also, the latest RedHat kernel fixed a copy_from_user (or lack thereof) vuln in the 3DLabs Gamma DRM driver.  This patch doesn't appear to be in the mainline kernel.  I've worked it up to apply against gentoo-sources-2.4.22-r7 and will attach it also.  In both patches, the DRM-4.1 and DRM-4.0 drivers are updated.  The patches will need to be modifed for any kernels that don't provide both.  Also, yesterday I meant to say CAN-2004-0010 is a vuln in ncpfs, not CAN-2004-0003 (X copy and paste is a little too easy sometimes).  And if these need to go under a new bug, let me know.  Thanks!  ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  antiher0    2004-02-19 14:16:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 25949](attachment.cgi?id=25949 "Check limits in R128 DRI drivers.

On my box, I get:  >>> Unpacking linux-2.4.19.tar.bz2 to /var/tmp/portage/gentoo-sources-2.4.19-r11/work >>> Unpacking patches-2.4.19-gentoo-r10.tar.bz2 to /var/tmp/portage/gentoo-sources-2.4.19-r11/work patching file arch/i386/kernel/entry.S patching file drivers/char/drm/i810_dma.c patching file drivers/char/drm-4.0/i810_dma.c RUNNING FROM extra_functions.sh  * Applying do_brk_fix.patch...

This is, I think, because the ebuild is looking for the patch directory in work/2.4.19-gentoo-r11 ( cd ${KV} ) but it was extracted to work/2.4.19-r10.  The patch I attached yesterday applies to 2.4.19-r10 because the 06_vm-strict-overcommit patch adds a ",1" to the do_munmap() calls.  The -r11 isn't applying the 06_vm-strict-overcommit patch hence the standard kernel patch for this vuln applies to it.  If the ebuild is fixed, the patch I made will work, I think.  But I'm not claiming to be an expert, just trying to help.  ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Tim Yamin (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-03-28 03:14:54 UTC  ``` Hmmm. This was fixed and a GLSA was released but this bug was never closed, closing the bug. ``` |  |

# [SECURITY] Fedora Core 1 Update: kernel-2.4.22-1.2173.nptl

```

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fedora Security Update Notification
FEDORA-2004-079
2004-02-18
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Name        : kernel
Version     : 2.4.22
Release     : 1.2173.nptl
Summary     : The Linux kernel (the core of the Linux operating system)
Description :
The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of your
Fedora Core Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the basic functions
of the operating system:  memory allocation, process allocation, device
input and output, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Paul Starzetz discovered a flaw in return value checking in mremap() in the
Linux kernel versions 2.4.24 and previous that may allow a local attacker
to gain root privileges.  No exploit is currently available; however this
issue is exploitable. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0077 to this issue.

Arjan van de Ven discovered a flaw in ncp_lookup() in ncpfs that could
allow local privilege escalation.  ncpfs is only used to allow a system to
mount volumes of NetWare servers or print to NetWare printers.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0010 to this issue.

All users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which contain
backported security patches that correct these issues.

Red Hat would like to thank Paul Starzetz from ISEC for reporting the issue
CAN-2004-0077.
