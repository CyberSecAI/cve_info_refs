iDEFENSE Security Advisory 02.11.04:

XFree86 Font Information File Buffer Overflow II
<http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=73>
February 12, 2004

I. BACKGROUND

In short, XFree86 is an open source X11-based desktop infrastructure.

XFree86, provides a client/server interface between display hardware
(the mouse, keyboard, and video displays) and the desktop environment
while also providing both the windowing infrastructure and a
standardized application interface (API). XFree86 is platform
independent, network-transparent and extensible.

II. DESCRIPTION

Exploitation of a buffer overflow in The XFree86 Project Inc.'s XFree86
X Window System allows local attackers to gain root privileges.

The vulnerability specifically exists in the use of the
CopyISOLatin1Lowered() function with the 'font_name' buffer. While
parsing a 'font.alias' file, the ReadFontAlias() function uses the
length of the input string as the limit for the copy, instead of the
size of the storage buffer. A malicious user may craft a malformed
'font.alias' file, causing a buffer overflow upon parsing and eventually
leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

To reproduce the overflow on the command line:

# cat > fonts.dir <<EOF
1
word.bdf -misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-120-75-75-c-60-iso8859-1
EOF
# perl -e 'print "data " . "0" x 2048 . "A" x 96 . "\n"' > fonts.alias
# X :0 -fp $PWD

In the function below, if lexToken is longer than MAXFONTNAMELEN*2
(2048 chars), an overflow occurs.

CopyISOLatin1Lowered(font_name, lexToken, strlen(lexToken));

This is a related issue to that discussed in the iDEFENSE report
"XFree86 Font Information File Buffer Overflow"
(<http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=72>).

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation requires that an attacker be able to execute
commands in the X11 subsystem. This can be done either by having console
access to the target or through a remote exploit against any X client
program such as a web-browser, mail-reader or game. Successful
exploitation yields root access.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in XFree86
versions 4.1.0 to the current version 4.3.0. It is suspected that
earlier versions are vulnerable as well.

V. VENDOR RESPONSE

The patch for the problem is at
ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/4.3.0/fixes/fontfile.diff and
it is applicable to all affected XFree86 versions.

VI. CVE INFORMATION

The Mitre Corp.'s Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Project
has assigned CAN-2004-0084 to this issue.

VII. DISCLOSURE TIMELINE

February 9, 2004    Exploit acquired by iDEFENSE
February 9, 2004    Initial vendor notification
February 9, 2004    Response received from David Dawes at XFree86.org
February 10, 2004   iDEFENSE Clients notified
February 12, 2004   Public disclosure

VIII. CREDIT

Greg MacManus (iDEFENSE Labs) is credited with this discovery.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

## XFree86 vulnerable to buffer overflow via error in 'ReadFontAlias()' function

#### Vulnerability Note VU#667502

Original Release Date: 2004-12-07 | Last Revised: 2005-10-25

---

### Overview

XFree86 contains a vulnerability in the parsing of the 'fonts.alias' file, which could be exploited by a local user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

### Description

| XFree86 contains a flaw during the processing of the 'fonts.alias' file. [XFree86](http://www.xfree86.org/) is an implementation of the X Window System. The '[fonts.alias](http://www.xfree86.org/4.3.0/mkfontdir.1.html#sect4)' file is used to map new names to existing fonts and must be placed in any directory of the font-path. When reading user input from the file it stores the user supplied data for the font name in a fixed-length buffer. It fails to check the length of the user input, leading to a buffer overflow condition |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local authenticated user may craft a 'fonts.alias' file to exploit this buffer overflow vulnerability, leading to execution of arbitrary code with root privileges. The local user must have privileges to write to one of the directories in the font-path to exploit this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or Patch**  This issue is resolved in [XFree86 4.3.0.2](http://www.xfree86.org/releases/rel430.html). Upgrade or apply patches as specified by your vendor. |
