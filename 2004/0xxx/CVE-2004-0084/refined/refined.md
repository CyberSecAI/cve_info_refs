{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `CopyISOLatin1Lowered()` function within the XFree86 X Window System when parsing a 'font.alias' file. The `ReadFontAlias()` function uses the input string's length as the copy limit, instead of the storage buffer's size. This allows a malicious user to craft a malformed 'font.alias' file, causing a buffer overflow during parsing.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
       "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can allow a local attacker to gain root privileges by executing arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially crafted 'font.alias' file and placing it in a font path directory.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to write to a directory within the X server's font path. They also need the ability to execute commands within the X11 subsystem, which can be achieved through console access or by exploiting a client program like a web browser or game."
  },
  "affected_versions": "XFree86 versions 4.1.0 up to and including 4.3.0. It is suspected that earlier versions are also vulnerable.",
  "patch": "A patch is available at ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/4.3.0/fixes/fontfile.diff and is applicable to all affected XFree86 versions."
