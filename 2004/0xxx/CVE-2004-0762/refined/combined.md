1. Topic:

Updated mozilla, galeon and epiphany packages that fix multiple
vulnerabilities are now available.

Mozilla is an open-source Web browser, designed for standards
compliance, performance, and portability.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

Note that some of these issues have already been fixed in Redhat 9 and
Fedora Core 1. Please refer to previous advisories for details.

NISCC testing of implementations of the S/MIME protocol uncovered a number
of bugs in NSS versions prior to 3.9. The parsing of unexpected ASN.1
constructs within S/MIME data could cause Mozilla to crash or consume large
amounts of memory. A remote attacker could potentially trigger these bugs
by sending a carefully-crafted S/MIME message to a victim. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0564 to this issue.

Andreas Sandblad discovered a cross-site scripting issue that affects
various versions of Mozilla. When linking to a new page it is still
possible to interact with the old page before the new page has been
successfully loaded. Any Javascript events will be invoked in the context
of the new page, making cross-site scripting possible if the different
pages belong to different domains. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0191 to
this issue.

Flaws have been found in the cookie path handling between a number of Web
browsers and servers. The HTTP cookie standard allows a Web server
supplying a cookie to a client to specify a subset of URLs on the origin
server to which the cookie applies. Web servers such as Apache do not
filter returned cookies and assume that the client will only send back
cookies for requests that fall within the server-supplied subset of URLs.
However, by supplying URLs that use path traversal (/../) and character
encoding, it is possible to fool many browsers into sending a cookie to a
path outside of the originally-specified subset. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0594 to this issue.

Zen Parse reported improper input validation to the SOAPParameter object
constructor leading to an integer overflow and controllable heap
corruption. Malicious JavaScript could be written to utilize this flaw and
could allow arbitrary code execution. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0722 to
this issue.

During a source code audit, Chris Evans discovered a buffer overflow and
integer overflows which affect the libpng code inside Mozilla. An attacker
could create a carefully crafted PNG file in such a way that it would cause
Mozilla to crash or execute arbitrary code when the image was viewed.
(CAN-2004-0597, CAN-2004-0599)

Zen Parse reported a flaw in the POP3 capability. A malicious POP3 server
could send a carefully crafted response that would cause a heap overflow
and potentially allow execution of arbitrary code as the user running
Mozilla. (CAN-2004-0757)

Marcel Boesch found a flaw that allows a CA certificate to be imported with
a DN the same as that of the built-in CA root certificates, which can cause
a denial of service to SSL pages, as the malicious certificate is treated
as invalid. (CAN-2004-0758)

Met - Martin Hassman reported a flaw in Mozilla that could allow malicious
Javascript code to upload local files from a users machine without
requiring confirmation. (CAN-2004-0759)

Mindlock Security reported a flaw in ftp URI handling. By using a NULL
character (%00) in a ftp URI, Mozilla can be confused into opening a
resource as a different MIME type. (CAN-2004-0760)

Mozilla does not properly prevent a frame in one domain from injecting
content into a frame that belongs to another domain, which facilitates
website spoofing and other attacks, also known as the frame injection
vulnerability. (CAN-2004-0718)

Tolga Tarhan reported a flaw that can allow a malicious webpage to use a
redirect sequence to spoof the security lock icon that makes a webpage
appear to be encrypted. (CAN-2004-0761)

Jesse Ruderman reported a security issue that affects a number of browsers
including Mozilla that could allow malicious websites to install arbitrary
extensions by using interactive events to manipulate the XPInstall Security
dialog box. (CAN-2004-0762)

Emmanouel Kellinis discovered a caching flaw in Mozilla which allows
malicious websites to spoof certificates of trusted websites via
redirects and Javascript that uses the "onunload" method. (CAN-2004-0763)

Mozilla allowed malicious websites to hijack the user interface via the
"chrome" flag and XML User Interface Language (XUL) files. (CAN-2004-0764)

The cert_TestHostName function in Mozilla only checks the hostname portion
of a certificate when the hostname portion of the URI is not a fully
qualified domain name (FQDN). This flaw could be used for spoofing if an
attacker had control of machines on a default DNS search path. (CAN-2004-0765)

Jesse Ruderman discovered a cross-domain scripting bug in Mozilla. If
a user is tricked into dragging a javascript link into another frame or
page, it becomes possible for an attacker to steal or modify sensitive
information from that site. Additionally, if a user is tricked into
dragging two links in sequence to another window (not frame), it is
possible for the attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0905 to this issue.

Gael Delalleau discovered an integer overflow which affects the BMP
handling code inside Mozilla. An attacker could create a carefully crafted
BMP file in such a way that it would cause Mozilla to crash or execute
arbitrary code when the image is viewed. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0904 to
this issue.

Georgi Guninski discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the vCard
display routines. An attacker could create a carefully crafted vCard file
in such a way that it would cause Mozilla to crash or execute arbitrary
code when viewed. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0903 to this issue.

Wladimir Palant discovered a flaw in the way javascript interacts with
the clipboard. It is possible that an attacker could use malicious
javascript code to steal sensitive data which has been copied into the
clipboard. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0908 to this issue.

Georgi Guninski discovered a heap based buffer overflow in the "Send
Page" feature. It is possible that an attacker could construct a link in
such a way that a user attempting to forward it could result in a crash or
arbitrary code execution. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0902 to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit
<http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs/> for directions on how to configure yum
and apt-get.

## [Race conditions in security dialogs](https://www.squarefree.com/2004/07/01/race-conditions-in-security-dialogs/ "Permanent Link: Race conditions in security dialogs")

I discovered arbitrary code execution holes in Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Opera that involve human reaction time. One version of the attack works like this:

![The secret word fills the blank in the sentence 'If ____ web developers would use alternate text correctly!'  It is all lowercase.](http://www.squarefree.com/162020/only.jpg)

The page contains a [captcha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha) displaying the word "only" and asks you to type the word to verify that you are a human. As soon as you type 'n', the site attempts to install software, resulting in a security dialog. When you type 'y' at the end of the word, you trigger the 'Yes' button in the dialog. I made a [demo](http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162020#c25) of this attack for Firefox and Mozilla.

Another form of the attack involves convincing the user to double-click a certain spot on the screen. This spot happens to be the location where the 'Yes' button will appear. The first click triggers the dialog; the second click lands on the 'Yes' button. I made a [demo](http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162020#c1) of this attack for Firefox and Mozilla.

These types of attack work on any security dialog that can be triggered by untrusted content. The attack is most useful in a dialog where one of the buttons means "Yes, let this untrusted content run arbitrary code". Firefox has such a dialog in the form of the extension installation (XPI) dialog. Similarly, Internet Explorer has the ActiveX installation dialog and Opera has an "Open" button for downloaded executables. Programs other than browsers might also be vulnerable.

Firefox's solution, from [bug 162020](http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162020), is to delay enabling the "Yes"/"Install" buttons until three seconds after the dialog appears. I believe that this is the only possible fix other than completely denying untrusted content the ability to pose the dialog. Unfortunately, this fix is frustrating for users who install extensions often.

Some users have been [intentionally lowering the delay to 0 seconds](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Disable_extension_install_delay_-_Firefox), which frustrates me. These users think the delay was added merely to force everyone to read the dialog. It surprises me that these users were not able to figure out the security hole given the fix. Ironically, advanced users are the most susceptible to these attacks, because they type and double-click faster than they react to unexpected stimuli.

It might be possible to lower the delay to less than three seconds, making it less annoying, without jeopardizing security. Designing experiments to determine the minimum "safe" delay would be tricky. You would want to do everything an attacker could do to increase participants' reaction time: give them a complicated task, make new rectangles appear every second to make the dialog less unexpected, etc.

It might make sense to make the dialog appear only after the user clicks a statusbar indicator that means "This web site wants to install software". This would get rid of the problem of choosing a delay, and it wouldn't require users who want to install extensions to wait.

   What if the “Yes” and “Cancel” buttons showed up reversed based on a random number? would that not fix it?
2. [Magus](http://collingrady.com) Says:

   [July 1st, 2004 at 8:01 pm](#comment-612)

   Reversed or not, if “y” is still the access key, it’ll still accept the prompt.

   However, on the linked bug, when I try the demo in Firefox, I don’t get a window that accepts a “y” but instead just says that a script was denied permissions with an Ok button.
3. [Jesse Ruderman](http://www.squarefree.com/) Says:

   [July 1st, 2004 at 8:09 pm](#comment-613)

   Magus: you have to save the demo and load it from disk or use about:config to set signed.applets.codebase\_principal\_support to true. A real attack would use ActiveX or XPIs instead of pure JavaScript and would not be subject to that restriction.

   WinZip randomises both the order of the OK/Cancel buttons and the accesskeys used. Or at least it used to.
5. [Jesse Ruderman](http://www.squarefree.com/) Says:

   [July 2nd, 2004 at 12:20 am](#comment-615)

   Randomizing the order of buttons wouldn’t help much, since it would only protect users 50% of the time. The shareware version of WinZip just did that to be annoying.

   I’d say the best solution would be to do like what Apple does on installers: Limit keyboard shortcuts.

   If you want to agree to the License in apple installers, you need to click with a mouse.

   Click to Install

   Then show a confirmation dialog “Are you sure”?

   And get rid of that silly ability to disable the wait.

   “If you want to agree to the License in apple installers, you need to click with a mouse.”

   Unfortunately, that would render the dialog inaccessible to those who can’t use mice.

   Did whitelisting make it into 0.9/0.9.1? I’m not sure. What is the advanced pref “allow websites to install software”?

    Whitelisting made it into 1.7 but was disabled in 0.9. I think Ben intends to make UI for the whitelist before enabling it.

    IMO, whitelisting is not a substitute for secure installation UI.

    WTF is this alert doing with …

    1. Buttons labelled “Yes” and “No”? Don’t do that. [http://mpt.phrasewise.com/stories/storyReader$4](http://mpt.phrasewise.com/stories/storyReader%244) Use “Install” and “Cancel” instead.

    2. … An accesskey for a button that’s already activated with the Enter key? Sloppy. You shouldn’t have two similarly accessible methods (e.g. keyboard combos) for doing the same thing, because people will waste time dithering wondering which one to use.

    3. … Text that talks about “file://” in a localization other than xx-geek?

    4. … Text that talks about “UniversalXPConnect privileges” in a localization other than xx-geek?

    5. … A “Remember this decision” checkbox that doesn’t tell you whether the remembering would be just for this script, just for this page, just for this host, or for any host at all?

    Granted, none of those would solve this bug. (Even if the accesskey was removed, the alert would still be accepted if the user pressed Enter, which the attacker could force by removing the submit button from the page.) But there’s little point in worrying about preventing people from accepting the alert accidentally, if its incomprehensibility means \*they’d accept it unquestioningly even if they were looking straight at it\*.

    Secunia posted this vulnerability: <http://secunia.com/advisories/11999/>

    They summarized the problem as “it may be possible to trick users into typing or clicking on a XPInstall / Security dialog box, using various interactive events, without the user noticing the dialog box”.

    But they listed it as only affecting Mozilla (except for 1.7), when they should have listed it as affecting Mozilla, IE, and Opera.
15. Robert White Says:

    [July 8th, 2004 at 6:27 pm](#comment-625)

    Actually, the answer is in two steps. Both require you to ignore the existance of the dialog box helper thing built into the GUI and, instead, open the “dialog box” as a full-fledged application window. Having done that, treat the window thusly:

    1) If the mouse happens to be over/within the extent of the window as it is realized on the screen, any existing mouse events and move the mouse pointer to a control-nutral location. I normally dispise any control that moves my mouse, but the ever-so-slight nudge required to place the mouse in the “nutral territory” between the buttons would be imperceptable to most of us, and helpful to those other of us who know why it is happening.

    2) Do \*NOT\* have the applicaiton transfer (Grab) focus in to the “dialog box”. I hate “always on top” “focus grabbers” anyway. Ever have your PGP pass phrase end up in some form that popped up on you? Very anoying. Very unsafe. The reach-for-the-moust set will never know that you didn’t grab the keyboard focus. They moused-over and clicked a button. End of story.

    3) If you \*must\* grab the focus, don’t bind the buttons so that “y” triggers “yes” etc. This is an important box protecting a significant system action. Require, at least, an alt-Y for the shorcut or something equally impressive like decoding [pause]”yes”[enter] and then put that right there on the screen in a message. And then beep and clatter when un-menaingful keystrokes come into context.

    The simple and obvious truth is that “pretty” isn’t “safe” and one-keystroke-install is just a bad idea from head to foot. Modal dialog boxes are a bane to human existance. Focus stealing is usually painful and unhelpful. Things that are not the “the thing that you are actively doing” should never, ever, own your keyboard nor “inherit” your mouse events.

    (If the Windows GUIs were not so lame, every click event would be attachd to the window instead of being queued and then resolved to a window “later”.)

    But now I rant.

    Clever find, Jesse. Did you actually find this in the wild, or just realize it yourself? “Discovered” is vague.

    Anyway, as one of the many users that you were “surprised” to see unable to figure out the purpose of the delay, I must say in my defence that it does definitely resemble features found in a lot of annoy-ware. I assumed some even-more serious attack was found with malicious XPIs, and the warning dialog was strengthened with the time delay. Just speaking of my own impressions, I think it was the actual display of the countdown, “(3), (2), (1)” that made me assume it was there to tell me “stop looking at this button and go back and read the warning, dummy”. But I suppose it would be even worse UI to have the Install button greyed-out, even for 2 seconds, with no indication as to why.

    This popup-window reaction-time race-condition reminds me of my personal annoyance with IM programs. If I’m logging into a server with SSH, and someone messages me just as I’m about to type the password, they could very well end up receiving it. Perhaps IM programs should consider a few second delay before you are able to reply to new conversations. Or better yet, come up with a less obtrusive incoming message display than a focus-stealing pop-up window.

    How about using a bar at the top of the web page (like the pop-up window warning bar) that prompts to install extensions, etc.

    Advantages: Doesn’t get in the way like a modal dialog

    No keyboard focus so can’t grab keypresses

    Disadvantages: Leaves keyboard users in the lurch.

    Spoofable through html imitation?

    ZoneAlarm provides similar security with its shutdown confirmation dialog box. The yes/no buttons require a mouseclick. They will not depress with a Y or N keystroke.

    [August 26th, 2004 at 4:31 am](#comment-631)

    Idea: why not combine the security alert and the download? So it would come up with:

    “Do you want to install blah blah?

    Downloading [XXXX–]

    [Install] [Cancel]

    where Install was only ungreyed when the download had finished (minimum 3 seconds), but the process could be cancelled at any time.

    This would a) get them their software faster if they wanted it, and b) provide a good reason for the delay.

    Showing a progress bar might make users think it was something Firefox chose to install, thereby causing users to select Install when they shouldn’t. Starting to download the XPI in the background sounds like a good idea, though — it would speed up legit downloads and waste the bandwidth of malware servers.

    [ At <http://taint.org/2004/09/24/194902a.html> ] I suggested that another good way to deal with this problem, would be to add a tickbox that must be ticked before the extension is installed. IMO, that’s a cleaner solution…

    **Captcha, Flycon, Gmail, Projector, Tricorder**

    **Premature Release**

    Well, things are pushing towards 1.0. Especially in a note by Ben Goodger today. Note, this isn’t in any way meant, to start a flame war, or a “Ben Goodger$oft is evil” rant… so if your going to comment along…

    “These users think the delay was added merely to force everyone to read the dialog. It surprises me that these users were not able to figure out the security hole given the fix.”

    Um, I’m one of those users. Please keep in mind that us users don’t know that the countdown is a “fix”, and don’t read Mozilla bug reports (especially when there are more than 100,000 of them). The most reasonable explanation for why a dialog has a countdown is that the author of the dialog wants to harass you into paying money to make the delay go away, or force you to read something you would skip.

    A line of text explaining why the countdown would go a long way. “Counting down to prevent double-click security threat” would have done it. Plus, it would give me something to read during the delay. :-)

    Frankly, I think one-click software install is almost impossible to lock-down from a security standpoint. If there’s a user-entered name of the package, just name it whatever action you want the user to take. “Click yes to install free porn utility.xpi” The Flash plug-in does this. “You must install this free software to correctly view the page (Flash)” is the gist of the message.

    Suggestions like “make the security window not take focus” break the consistency of the window manager and in my opinion are not acceptable. If you think people have trouble figuring out why there’s a countdown in the security dialog, try to get them to explain to you why the window doesn’t take focus.

    The double-click issue is interesting because many people double-click on links to follow them, rather than single click. This is, of course, due to inconsistency between the file manager “open folder/file” double-click and the web browser “open page” single-click. And it ain’t gonna change any time soon, I suspect.

|  | |

If I can control or predict when and where a user will click, I can get them to
install software. That's not surprising, but it didn't seem to be in Bugzilla.
It probably hadn't been filed because most of possible fixes suck and/or
because nobody had come up with a good exploit.
How can I control or predict when and where a user will click?
1. A game.
1a. Make the player "pick up" items by clicking them. Measure the speed with
which the player moves the mouse and clicks, and once the speed stabilizes, pop
up an install dialog just before the player clicks.
1b. Force the player to click at exactly the right time: a reaction-time test,
shoot the monkey, etc.
1c. Convince the player to double-click an object whose location I control.
1d. Tell the player that he has infinite ammo and can shoot by pressing or
holding the 'i' button on the keyboard. Pop up an install dialog when the
player runs out of ammo.
2. Pop-up hell.
2a. Make the 'x' for the pop-up ad appear just where a security dialog will
appear.
2b. Make fake pop-ups out of images so you can measure the victim's reaction
time, average mouse acceleration, etc. Get them on the fifth "pop-up".
I will attach a demo of 1c, a game that involves double-clicking.
Possible fixes, all of which suck:
A) When a site tries to install software or calls enablePrivilege, display a
status bar message, "This page would like to install software on your computer".
Only display the dialog after the user clicks the status bar message. (Err,
how do you click a status bar message with the keyboard?)
B) Add a one-second delay between when the dialog gets focus and when the
Install/OK button becomes enabled. I say "gets focus" rather than "appears"
because a site could hide an install dialog as a modal dialog of a background
window for a minute and then bring the dialog to the front at a convinient time
by closing the window in front.
C) If the total time to decide to install and download the xpi are less than
five seconds, stall installation (with the "downloading..." dialog still up)
until five seconds are up so the user has an extra chance to cancel. I'm
worried that users might not know to cancel because they do not realize that
they accidentally clicked "install" in a dangerous dialog.
B and C both involve timers, which might be bad for accessibility
(<http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-UAAG10-20010912/guidelines#tech-time-independent>).

[demo: double-click game](attachment.cgi?id=94712)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=94712&action=edit)

Demo for 1c on Windows 2000 (classic or modern skin). The third time you play
this game, it pops up an enablePrivilege dialog on the first click of a
double-click. You have to load this demo from file:/// because I used
enablePrivilege rather than install or install-skin.

Of the possible solutions I mentioned in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=162020#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - pop up XPInstall/security dialog when user is about to click"), I prefer B, disable the
Install/Ok button for about a second when the dialog gains focus.

Dveditz suggested:
D) Open confirm dialogs in a random spot on the screen.
That would not be a complete solution. It would introduce randomness instead of
making the exploit impossible, and it would not fix keyboard versions of the
exploit ("hold i to fire your weapon", "how quickly and accurately can you
delete hotmail spam? try using tab and space instead of the mouse", etc). I'm
also not convinced that opening a dialog in a random location (making Mozilla
look buggy) is better UI for non-malicious sites than disabling the Install
button for a second (making Mozilla look slow).
I don't think it's possible to fix this hole without introducing some kind of
delay (B or C), reserving space or shortcuts for making a dangerous dialog to
appear (A), or reserving space or shortcuts for the Install button.

I like the delay solution.
I'm not sure that this bug needs to be closed. The issue applies to all
browsers, is not trivial to exploit, requires user interaction so it's not
wormable, and requires the user to visit an evil HTML page. Wider feedback on
possible solutions would also be useful.

OTOH, this is exactly the sort of thing that gives bad people bad ideas. Let's
keep it private for now, and move further public/private discussion to the
security group mailing list. There's definitely some fixes we could pursue here.
Can someone check IE's behavior and see if they do anything to mitigate this? Jesse?

> requires user interaction so it's not wormable
A mail worm/virus (?) exploiting this hole would not spread as effectively as
one exploiting a hole that requires no user interaction, but it could still
infect a large number of computers.
> Can someone check IE's behavior and see if they do anything to mitigate this?
The Teoma search bar can be uninstalled and reinstalled quickly. I tried the
following at <http://sp.ask.com/docs/teoma/toolbar/index.php>:
a) Press "y" on the keyboard as quickly as I can react after the dialog appears.
b) Click "Yes" as quickly as I can react after the dialog appears.
c) Click repeatedly where the "Yes" button will appear and \*stop\* clicking if I
notice the dialog before I've already accepted it.
In all three cases, the Teoma search bar was installed. So IE doesn't seem to
do anything to mitigate this kind of attack beyond requiring ActiveX code to be
signed.

Let's add a checkbox to the XPInstall dialog, essentially saying "yes, I really
want to do this." That way, initiating an install is a two-click process.

Sorry, I'll take dancing pigs over a checkbox.
I like the delay idea better, or opening the dialog in a random spot on the
screen. When Dougt lands signed XPI support soon he'll be effectively adding the
delay while we download enough of the archive to see if it's got a signature.
Would that be good enough? Perhaps not on a fast connection, but let's land that
first and see.

Adding a checkbox would not fix the keyboard variant of the exploit from comment
3: "how quickly and accurately can you delete hotmail spam? try using tab and
space instead of the mouse".
The delay introduced by "signed XPI" will vary between computers, so I don't see
why we're waiting for that to be fixed before fixing this security hole.

We're not going to achieve a perfect solution here that doesn't seriously hamper
usability or just make us look dumb. Let's not reject a reasonable 80% solution
simply becasue it isn't 100%. I still think an additional checkbox will go a
long way towards preventing accidental installs and is not as annoying as a
delay, but maybe we should get the input of a UE person.

These people noticed the 2-second delay for installing Firefox extensions and
weren't angry about it: <http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229600#c34>.
They also didn't figure out the exact security hole -- they thought the purpose
of the delay was to encourage users to start reading the text in the dialog
before clicking. I guess that's a good side effect of the fix :)

Ok, thanks for the clarification. I thought it would present the user with the
normal "unrecognized certificate, do you want to trust it" dialog.
Getting a certificate from a trusted CA certainly raises the bar to make an
exploit using signed XPI, although there have been cases in the past where
people have fooled the CAs to give certificates they shouldn't have. We can't
really do anything about that, though.

CAs verify your identity, not your trustworthiness. It's very hard to get a
CA-signed certificate saying that you're Microsoft, but it's easy to get a
CA-signed certificate saying that you're you, which is sufficient for getting
around a fix for [bug 238960](/show_bug.cgi?id=238960 "RESOLVED FIXED - Require XPIs to be signed") in order to exploit this bug. Therefore, [bug 238960](/show_bug.cgi?id=238960 "RESOLVED FIXED - Require XPIs to be signed")
is orthogonal to this bug.

Attached file
[demo: fake captcha](attachment.cgi?id=145416)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=145416&action=edit)

Like [attachment 94712](/attachment.cgi?id=94712 "demo: double-click game") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=94712&action=edit "demo: double-click game"), this attacks the script-permissions dialog, so you must
enable codebase principles or save to disk to test. A real attacker would sign
the script, serve it from https, or attack the XPI dialog instead.

I plan to disclose this security hole soon after both Mozilla 1.7 (~May 12) and
Firefox 0.9 have been released.
Recap:
\* Impact: Arbitrary code execution.
\* Ease of exploitation: Must convince visitor to do one of the following:
o Click at specific place, time [game: shoot the monkey]
o Double-click at specific place [game: clicking speed, [attachment 94712](/attachment.cgi?id=94712 "demo: double-click game") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=94712&action=edit "demo: double-click game")]
o Press tab-space [game: spam deletion]
o Hold down 'y' [game: shooting]
o Type a word containing 'y' [captcha, [attachment 145416](/attachment.cgi?id=145416 "demo: fake captcha") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=145416&action=edit "demo: fake captcha")]
\* Affects: Seamonkey and Firefox (script permissions), Seamonkey (XPI), IE
(ActiveX), Opera.
I think all that remains to be done to fix the security hole is:
\* Prevent a variation in the attack that Ben Goodger's fix for Firefox XPIs
missed ([bug 239411](/show_bug.cgi?id=239411 "RESOLVED FIXED - install delay should stop+reset when Software Installation dialog loses focus")).
\* Make script-permission dialogs and Seamonkey XPI dialogs have the same delay
behavior as Firefox XPI dialogs (this bug).

I would argue that an install that is from some known and verified identity is
less likely to be malicious.

Doug: that strategy (require installable code to be signed but don't do much
else to prevent malicious code from being installed) didn't work for IE. Lots
of spyware is distributed through ActiveX. Even if [bug 238960](/show_bug.cgi?id=238960 "RESOLVED FIXED - Require XPIs to be signed") were fixed (I
think it shouldn't be), not fixing \*this\* bug would mean leaving open an
arbitrary code execution hole to anyone with a CA-signed certificate.

One comment about the "Firefox solution". We could do that with the Suite
XPInstall dialog since it's also XUL, but if you look at the actual test cases
here you can see that the security dialogs are just as big a problem, if not
bigger. Those dialogs are brought up using the frozen nsIPromptService interface
which is not as easy to address.

There are enough bits in the ConfirmEx code that we could add one to enable this
behavior and put the change in commondialog.js. That's assuming people want this
behavior for all security related dialogs.
XPI dialog has always been its own XUL.

Attached patch

[delay enabling buttons in XPInstall and security dialogs](attachment.cgi?id=149817&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=149817&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=162020&attachment=149817)

This patch causes a 2 second delay before the security and xpinstall dialog
buttons are enabled. The delay time is pref-adjustable. This does not address
the attack described in [bug 239411](/show_bug.cgi?id=239411 "RESOLVED FIXED - install delay should stop+reset when Software Installation dialog loses focus")
Firefox appears to have its own copy of the commonDialogs which will need to be
patched.

delay enabling buttons in XPInstall and security dialogs
"Disabled by default" should be something like "disabled initially".
It looks like this patch also disables the cancel button. The cancel button
should always be enabled.
The first parameter to setTimeout should be reenableInstallButtons, not the
string "reenableInstallButtons()".
security.dialog\_focus\_delay should be security.dialog\_enable\_delay

Tested with the 1.7 branch on Win2000. When using the Nuke program, get the
confirm dialog "A script from 'file://' has requested UniversalXPConnect
privileges ... Do you wish to allow these privileges?" If Yes, then we get
[object nsXPCComponent\_Classes] each time clicking the target. There is a delay
when the Yes button is enabled again. If No, get "A script from 'file://' was
denied UniversalXPConnect privileges" each time. This is working correctly.
Similar thing when testing Captcha independently. After two letters of the word
is entered in the verification screen, get the same confirm dialog. If No, get
"privilege not granted". But regardless of whether Yes or No is selected, once
the entire word is entered, and pressing the button, get the security warning
dlog: "The information you have entered is to be sent over an unencrypted
connection and could easily be read by a 3rd party? Continue or Cancel." Sound
correct?
The "remembering the decision" setting works fine.

BTW, JS tip o' the day. From the game in the first attachment:
function setResults(a,b,c,d)
{
results = document.getElementById("results");
results.rows[0].cells[1].innerHTML = a ? a : "You call that a double-click?";
results.rows[1].cells[1].innerHTML = b ? b : "Dud";
results.rows[2].cells[1].innerHTML = c ? c : "Undamaged";
results.rows[3].cells[1].innerHTML = d ? d : "$50";
}
Those ?: expressions should just use ||, which like && in JS preserves deciding
operand value (after Perl).

I see this bug has recently been unhidden. To thwart the "keep pressing the 'I'
key..." attacks, how about making the XPI dialog non-modal and keeping the focus
on the parent window even after the XPI dialog has popped up? So in effect, any
keystrokes would remain being sent to the HTML window. The only way to bring
focus to the XPI dialog would be to click on it or to ALT+TAB to it.

(In reply to [comment #42](/show_bug.cgi?id=162020#c42 "RESOLVED FIXED - pop up XPInstall/security dialog when user is about to click"))
> security.dialog\_focus\_delay should be security.dialog\_enable\_delay
Jesse, your mentioned pref doesn't work for AVIARY builds. You can set any value
you want but there is an delay of three seconds every time. I've opened [bug
245737](/show_bug.cgi?id=245737 "VERIFIED FIXED - Install countdown should respect \"security.dialog_enable_delay\"") a time ago which handles the not working pref setting for Firefox.Blocks: [245737](/show_bug.cgi?id=245737 "VERIFIED FIXED - Install countdown should respect \"security.dialog_enable_delay\"")

The firefox security dialog does respect the delay pref. Firefox fixed their
version of the install dialog in [bug 236056](/show_bug.cgi?id=236056 "RESOLVED FIXED - pop up XPInstall dialog when user is about to click") before we created the delay pref.
[Bug 245737](/show_bug.cgi?id=245737 "VERIFIED FIXED - Install countdown should respect \"security.dialog_enable_delay\"") is an appropriate firefox bug, but it doesn't depend on this one. The
"fixed-aviary1.0" keyword refers to the security dialog change since, as
mentioned, Firefox had already fixed [bug 236056](/show_bug.cgi?id=236056 "RESOLVED FIXED - pop up XPInstall dialog when user is about to click")No longer blocks: [245737](/show_bug.cgi?id=245737 "VERIFIED FIXED - Install countdown should respect \"security.dialog_enable_delay\"")

I know this is rather old, but I thought I should add my 2 cents. Randomizing the access keys and ensuring the dialog isn't placed under the mouse cursor would essentially prevent this, except for "see how fast you can close popups" sort of games where the popups have the same layout as the install dialog. However, more importantly, on the off chance the user is tricked into installing something, the extension is disabled until FF is restarted - simply keeping the dialog on the screen with an option to uninstall immediately would allow the malicious extension to be removed without ever being executed.

Unless the attacker is doing keystroke games as in the similar just-patched Explorer vulnerability <http://secunia.com/secunia_research/2005-7/advisory/>

Attacker could (and therefore would) get around that by using an old-style .xpi which executes install.js immediately.
For essentially the same thing in Explorer see

IE6 in WinXP SP2 now disables the "Run" button for about a second when you click a link to download an exe file. It isn't visibly disabled, and it even depresses if you click it, but it isn't active during that period.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
