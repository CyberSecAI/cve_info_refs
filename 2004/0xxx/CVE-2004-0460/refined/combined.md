How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Technical Cyber Security Alert TA04-174A
Multiple Vulnerabilities in ISC DHCP 3

Original release date: June 22, 2004
Last revised:  --
Source: US-CERT

Systems Affected

* ISC DHCP versions 3.0.1rc12 and  3.0.1rc13

Overview

Two vulnerabilities in the ISC  DHCP allow a remote attacker to cause a
denial of the DHCP  service on a vulnerable system. It may be possible
to exploit  these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the
system.

I. Description

As described in RFC 2131, "the  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
(DHCP) provides a framework  for passing configuration information to
hosts on a TCP/IP  network." The Internet Systems Consortium's (ISC)
Dynamic Host  Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 3 application contains two
vulnerabilities that present several potential buffer overflow
conditions.

VU#317350 discusses a buffer overflow  vulnerability in the temporary
storage of log lines. In  transactions, ISC DHCPD logs every DHCP
packet along with  several pieces of descriptive information. The
client's DISCOVER  and the resulting OFFER, REQUEST, ACK, and NAKs are
all logged.  In all of these messages, if the client supplied a
hostname,  then it is also included in the logged line. As part of the
DHCP  datagram format, a client may specify multiple hostname options,
up to 255 bytes per option. These options are concatenated by  the
server. If the hostname and options contain only ASCII  characters,
then the string will pass non-ASCII character  filters and be
temporarily stored in 1024 byte fixed-length  buffers on the stack. If
a client supplies enough hostname  options, it is possible to overflow
the fixed-length  buffer.

VU#654390 discusses C include files for systems that  do not support
the bounds checking vsnprintf() function. These  files define the
bounds checking vsnprintf() to the non-bounds  checking vsprintf()
function. Since vsprintf() is a function  that does not check bounds,
the size is discarded, creating the  potential for a buffer overflow
when client data is supplied.  Note that the vsnprintf() statements are
defined after the  vulnerable code that is discussed in VU#317350.
Since the  preconditions for this vulnerability are similar to those
required to exploit VU#317350, these buffer overflow conditions  occur
sequentially in the code after the buffer overflow  vulnerability
discussed in VU#317350, and these issues were  discovered and resolved
at the same time, there is no known  exploit path to exploit these
buffer overflow conditions caused  by VU#654390. Note that VU#654390
was discovered and exploitable  once VU#317350 was resolved.

For both of the  vulnerabilities, only ISC DHCP 3.0.1rc12 and ISC DHCP
3.0.1rc13  are believed to be vulnerable. VU#317350 is exploitable for
all  operating systems and configurations. VU#654390 is only defined
for the following operating systems:

* AIX
* AlphaOS
* Cygwin32
* HP-UX
* Irix
* Linux
* NextStep
* SCO
*  SunOS 4
* SunOS 5.5
*  Ultrix

All versions of ISC DCHP 3, including all snapshots,  betas, and
release candidates, contain the flawed code. However,  versions other
than ISC DHCP 3.0.1rc12 and ISC DHCP 3.0.1rc13  discard all but the
last hostname option provided by the client,  so it is not believed
that these versions are  exploitable.

US-CERT is tracking these issues as VU#317350,  which has been assigned
CVE CAN-2004-0460, and VU#654390, which  has been assigned CVE
CAN-2004-0461.

II.  Impact

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities may cause a  denial-of-service
condition to the DHCP daemon (DHCPD) and may  permit a remote attacker
to execute arbitrary code on the system  with the privileges of the
DHCPD process, typically  root.

III. Solution

Apply patches or  upgrade

These issues have been resolved in ISC DHCP  3.0.1rc14. Your vendor may
provide specific patches or updates.  For vendor-specific information,
please see your vendor's site,  or look for your vendor infomation in
VU#317350 and VU#654390.  As vendors report new information to US-CERT,
we will update the  vulnerability notes.

It is possible that if enough hostname options are supplied by the client, and other text is logged in the same line, then the static buffer will be overflown, writing over the stack. If non-ASCII or non-printable characters are supplied, then there are other checks and filters that will prevent this buffer overflow from occuring.Only ISC DHCP 3.0.1rc12 and ISC DHCP 3.0.1rc13 are believed to be vulnerable for all operating systems and configurations. All versions of ISC DCHP 3, including all snapshots, betas, and release candidates, contain the flawed code. However, since these versions discard of all but the last hostname option provided by the client, it is not believed that these versions are exploitable. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker with the ability to send a crafted packet to the DHCPD listening port (typically port 67/UDP), may be able to crash the ISC DHCP daemon, causing a denial of service. It may be possible to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server with the privileges of the DHCPD process (typically root). |
| --- |

### Solution

| ISC has released DHCP 3.0.1rc14 which resolves this issue. Versions prior to ISC DHCP 3 are no longer supported. All users of ISC DHCP are encouraged to update to the latest version. |

SUMMARY

It was disclaimed by ISC, via CERT, that some specially crafted DHCP packets
could cause a stack overflow and crash ISC based DHCPD.

PRODUCTS AND FIRMWARE VERSIONS AFFECTED

Hardware: No Aruba Wireless Networks Platform are affected
Software: No Aruba available versions are affected

DETAILS

This issue could cause a stack overflow and eventual crash of the machine
running ISC's DHCPd. Although it was not clear if whether or not that overflow
could be used to execute arbitrary code, this should not cause a problem on Aruba
Wireless Networks products, since they are not affected by the packets described
in the CERT notification.

IMPACT

None.

WORKAROUNDS

There is no need for a workaround to be implemented.

SOLUTION

Aruba products were tested against this possible attack and are not vulnerable to it.

Hi,
for those interested to reproduce the recent DOS attacks against ISC
DHCPD 3.0.1 rc12 and rc13
as described in:
<http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/317350>
, i'm forwarding the first email i sent to ISC describing several stack
based buffer overflows occuring during the creation
of log messages and triggered by sending several DHCP HOSTNAME options
within a single request.
This mail also includes a trace of such DHCP REQUEST.

Other .bss overflows related to vsnprintf and identified later during
our investigations as described in:
<http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/654390>
can be triggered the exact same way.
Note that the home made tool i am referencing in this email will be made
available very soon and already includes ISC, INFOBLOX and DLINK dhcp
vulnerabilities
I will drop a note here when it is finally released.
cheers,
Gregory

Special thanks to Solar Designer and David W.Hankins (ISC)

--- Original email ------

Summary:

i have discovered several stack based overflow in your dhcp-3.0.1rc12
and rc13 (may be others, have not checked)
these vulnerabilities can be easily triggered by crafting a dhcp
discover or request packet which carries several  hostname dhcp options that
,once reassembled by the daemon (as explained in rfc 3396), overflow a
stack based variable causing the daemon to crash.
I believe than one might execute code remotely on the server with the
same user account dhcpd is running with, root in most cases.
I have been able at some points during the tests, to control eip' 4
bytes (intel 32bits arch), it was during the ddns forward update operation.
Note that all tests have been made on a linux 2.4.20-24.9 using a home
made tool to generate custom dhcp traffic

Now an example:

see dhcpd.conf in attachment if you need it.

structure of an offending packet (case of a dhcp request based attack)

Note that the daemon may actually crash at a different location
depending of the first corrupted structure it meets and therefore,
of the size of the malicious option sent, along with the context (type
of packet, leases in use etc...)

Problems in the source:
I have spent quite some time to find out where the overflow actually
takes its roots, here are my findings:

file server/dhcp.c:
function dhcprequest :

        char msgbuf [1024]; /* XXX */
        char *s;

....

  if (lease && lease -> client_hostname &&
            db_printable (lease -> client_hostname))
                s = lease -> client_hostname;
        else
                s = (char *)0;

......

  sprintf (msgbuf, "DHCPREQUEST for %s%s from %s %s%s%svia %s",
                 piaddr (cip), smbuf,
                 (packet -> raw -> htype
                  ? print_hw_addr (packet -> raw -> htype,
                                   packet -> raw -> hlen,
                                   packet -> raw -> chaddr)
                  : (lease
                     ? print_hex_1 (lease -> uid_len, lease -> uid,
                                    lease -> uid_len)
                     : "<no identifier>")),
                 s ? "(" : "", s ? s : "", s ? ") " : "",
                  packet -> raw -> giaddr.s_addr
                  ? inet_ntoa (packet -> raw -> giaddr)
                  : packet -> interface -> name);

To summarize, s is referencing the reassembled hostname option passed to
the daemon, afterwhat it is used as is in sprintf and stored in msgbuf
(fixed size) without any length checking.
local msgbuf can obviously be overrun, corrupting various structures in
stack and eventually causing the server to crash
Note that the call to db_printable( ), filtering hostname,  may render
the task harder to root a server but likely not impossible.
Also being able to corrupt structures like *lease or *oc may have
interesting side effects from an attacker perspective.

void dhcprequest (packet, ms_nulltp, ip_lease)
        struct packet *packet;
        int ms_nulltp;
        struct lease *ip_lease;
{
        struct lease *lease;
        struct iaddr cip;
        struct iaddr sip;
        struct subnet *subnet;
        int ours = 0;
        struct option_cache *oc;
        struct data_string data;
        int status;
        char msgbuf [1024]; /* XXX */
        char *s;
        char smbuf [[19]](#19);

....

the very same problem is present in dhcpdiscover( ),  dhcpdecline( ),
dhcprequest(  ) , dhcprelease( ), ...
please look at the diff in unified format, attached to this email, for a
detailed list.
