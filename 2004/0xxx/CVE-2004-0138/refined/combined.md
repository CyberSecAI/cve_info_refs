============================================
:
o ia64: make hpzx1 fake pci device safer

:
o ia64: Remove platform\_pci\_enable\_device() machine vector and synchronize sba\_iommu.c with 2.5.
o ia64: Bail out of SBA init function if no IOC found. Avoids spurious (but harmless) "No IOC for PCI Bus 0000:00 in ACPI" messages when booting generic kernel on non-ZX1 hardware.
o ia64: Clear corrected errors (CMCs and CPEs) in the kernel
o ia64: The "HP\_ZX1" kernel works on sx1000-based machines as well as zx1-based ones, so make the descriptions a little more generic.
o ia64: add kmap\_types.h to make crypto, etc compile. (This is just a dummy file from 2.6 and shouldn't ever be used.)
o ia64: fix EFI memory map trimming
o Cset exclude: kaos@sgi.com[helgaas]|ChangeSet|20031030215302|13517

:
o [RTNETLINK]: Add RTPROT\_XORP
:

David Mosberger:
o ia64: In , do not include  outside the #ifdef \_\_KERNEL\_\_ bracket. Doing so pollutes the user- level namespace. Bug report & proposed fix by GOTO Masanori.
o ia64: Control /proc/bus/mckinley/zx1 via separate SBA\_PROC\_FS macro and turn SBA\_PROC\_FS off by default (it's too much of a scalability bottleneck).
o ia64: Mark access\_ok() as likely to succeed (as is done in x86 tree)
o ia64: Fix efi\_mem\_type() and efi\_mem\_attributes() to avoid potential underflows. In my case, the underflows occurred with the first memory descriptor which got trimmed down to a size of 0.
o ia64: Fix a alternate-signal-stack bug which could corrupt RNaT bits when bspstore happened to point to an RNaT-slot.
o ia64: Fix a bug in sigtramp() which corrupted ar.rnat when unwinding across a signal trampoline (in user space). Reported by Laurent Morichetti.

Glen Overby:
o [XFS] A problem was found with the debug code in xlog\_state\_do\_callback. At the end of processing all log buffers that can be processed, there is a (debug only) double-check to make sure that log buffers with completed I/O don't get marooned when the function completes. The check only needs to go to the first buffer that will cause an I/O completion, that has not completed. The loop doesn't stop a WANT\_SYNC state buffer is found, but it should.
o [XFS] xfs\_dir2\_node\_addname\_int had reminants of an old block placement algorithm in it. The old algorithm appeared to look for the first place to put a new data block, and thus a new freespace block (this is where the 'foundindex' variable came from). However, new space in a directory is always added at the lowest file offset as determined by the extent list. So this stuff is never used.

Keith Owens:
o ia64: fix offsets.h generation bootstrap problem
o ia64: mca\_asm.h documentation fixes

o ia64: salinfo.c cleanup and race removal
o ia64: print header from INIT records
o ia64: fix comment typo (sal.h)
o ia64: Clean up kernel salinfo state checking

o [XFS] Change writepage code so that we mark a page uptodate if all of its buffers are uptodate, and we are not doing a partial page write
o [XFS] Remove xfs\_attr\_fetch.c - the one routine was a copy of another, so instead of fixing a bug in two places I merged the two routines
o [XFS] Use the same name for a function here as in the 2.5/2.6 tree
o [XFS] Use xfs\_dev\_t size rather than dev\_t size in xfs\_attr\_fork initialization

o [XFS] Clean up inode revalidation code slightly
o [XFS] Fix up pointers in diagnostics, print using %p not %x for 64 bit platforms

o [XFS] Backport minor 2.6 changes to the iomap interface to keep code more in sync
o [XFS] Backport an unmerged bug fix from the 2.6 code base - if probe\_unmapped\_page fails while walking down the unmapped page list, do not attempt to probe the last page as well just return
o [XFS] Backport an unmerged bug fix from the 2.6 code base - only submit a convert\_page page for IO if startio is set
o [XFS] Backport some trivial changes from the 2.6 code base - page uptodate flag macro name changes
o [XFS] Move Linux-version specific code out of xfs\_iomap.c so that it can become part of the XFS core code
o [XFS] Seperate the NFS reference cache code out from xfs\_rw.c to simplify management of different kernel versions
o [XFS] Remove assertion that we do not hold a lock - no lock ownership state available
o [XFS] Merge page\_buf\_locking routines in with the rest of page\_buf

o [XFS] Convert to revised kmem shake interface
o [XFS] Update the way we hook into the generic direct IO code so we share more code. This means we no longer need to dup remove\_suid within xfs\_write\_clear\_setuid
o [XFS] Add the noikeep mount option, make ikeep the default for now
o [XFS] Use vnode timespec modifiers for atime/mtime/ctime, keeps last code hunk in sync

o [XFS] Close some holes in the metadata flush logic used during unmount, make sure we have no pending I/O completion calls for metadata, and that we only keep hold of metadata buffers for I/O completion if we want to. Still not perfect, but better than it was.
o [XFS] When calculating the number of pages to probe for an unwritten extent, use the size of the extent, not the page count of the pagebuf which is initialized to zero.
o [XFS] Rework how xfs and the linux generic I/O code interoperate again to deal with deadlock issues between the i\_sem and i\_alloc\_sem and the xfs IO lock.
o [XFS] move unwritten extent conversion for O\_DIRECT into the write thread and out of the I/O completion threads. This scales better.
o [XFS] Code cleanup
o [XFS] small cleanup
o [XFS] fix the previous change which compiled by fluke, the conditional use of the i\_alloc\_sem was wrong. No actual change in the generated code for 2.4.22, there will be for older kernels though.
o [XFS] fix up error unlock paths in xfs\_write
o [XFS] Implement deletion of inode clusters in XFS
o [XFS] cleanup uio use some more
o [XFS] remove FINVIS from xfs, instead use a seperate file ops vector for files which are opened for invisible I/O.
Steven Cole:
o 2.4.23 update Documentation/Changes for quota-tools
St�phane Eranian:
o ia64: perfmon-1 inheritance bugfix
Tom Rini:
o PPC32: Convert all bootwrappers that use OpenFirmware to use the same code

o ia64: Another MCA fix
Ville Nuorvala:
o [IPV6]: Verify nlmsg\_len in rt6\_dump\_route()
William Lee Irwin III:
o Fixup smb\_boot\_cpus(): Fix HT detection bug
o out\_of\_memory() locking
o fix 2.4 BLK\_BOUNCE\_ANY

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
