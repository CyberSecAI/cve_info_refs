## CUPS stores user account details in plain text in log file

#### Vulnerability Note VU#557062

Original Release Date: 2004-11-19 | Last Revised: 2004-12-17

---

### Overview

When an SMB printer is configured, CUPS stores plain text login information to the log file.

### Description

| [CUPS](http://cups.org/) is a cross-platform printing system for UNIX environments. It can use the IPP, LPD, SMB, and JetDirect protocols to interact with printers. The SMB protocol is used to communicate with printers that are shared via Microsoft Windows or other SMB-compatible software such as Samba. When an SMB printer is added or modified, the connection string for the printer is written to the log file in plain text. This connection string will contain a username and password if authentication is required for the printer. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local authenticated user may be able to retrieve the usernames and passwords for other accounts. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from your vendor**  For vendor-specific information regarding vulnerable status and patch availability, please see the Systems Affected section of this document. |
| --- |

| **Upgrade your version of CUPS**This issue is resolved in [CUPS 1.1.22rc1](http://cups.org/software.php). Starting with this version, the connection string for the printer is sanitized so that it does not contain sensitive information.**Restrict access to the CUPS log file**By default, the CUPS log file is world-readable. Access to the CUPS log file can be restricted by setting the [LogFilePerm](http://www.cups.org/sam.html#LogFilePerm) option in cupsd.conf to "0600" **Do not use authenticated printing to Windows via Samba**Because of the possibility of disclosing sensitive information when using a printer shared via SMB, it is suggested to use other protocols such as LPD. Windows can function as an LPD server when [Print Services for UNIX](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/printservicesunix.mspx) is installed. |

Package        : cupsys
Vulnerability  : unsanitised input
Problem-Type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0923
CERT advisory  : VU#557062

An information leak has been detected in CUPS, the Common UNIX
Printing System, which may lead to the disclosure of sensitive
information, such as user names and passwords which are written into
log files.

The used patch only eliminates the authentication information in the
device URI which is logged in the error_log file.  It does not
eliminate the URI from the environment and process table, which is why
the CUPS developers recommend that system administrators do not code
authentication information in device URIs in the first place.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.14-5woody7.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.20final+rc1-9.

We recommend that you upgrade your CUPS package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
