Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2004-0419:

*   **Vulnerability:** XDM (X Display Manager) opens TCP sockets for its chooser even when the `DisplayManager.requestPort` setting is set to 0.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a backported patch in Fedora Core 1 and 2 that was not present in the upstream XFree86 4.3.0. Even with the intention to disable remote connections by setting `DisplayManager.requestPort` to 0, XDM still opens a TCP socket, negating this configuration.
*   **Affected Systems:** XFree86 (<= 4.3.0-r5), xorg-x11 (<= 6.7.0) and Fedora Core 1 and 2.
*   **Impact:** Remote clients can exploit this open port to connect to XDM and request a login window, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.  Attackers need a pre-existing account on the target machine to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote network access.  An attacker connects to the exposed TCP port.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the network where the XDM service is running and must have a valid user account on the target system.
*   **Severity:** The severity is considered **low** to **medium**, as XDM is not used by default.
*   **Resolution:** Upgrade to xfree-4.3.0-r6 or xorg-x11-6.7.0-r1 or later.
