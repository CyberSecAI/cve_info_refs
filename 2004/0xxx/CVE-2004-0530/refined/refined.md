  "CVE-2004-0530": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "The provided content describes a security vulnerability in PHP packages for Slackware Linux, where linking against a static library in an insecure path (/tmp) could allow local attackers to execute arbitrary code as the PHP user.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from compiling PHP against a static library located in a path under /tmp. This resulted in an ELF rpath to that location being built into the PHP binaries.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure library path: Using a temporary directory like /tmp to store static libraries used during compilation.",
      "ELF rpath vulnerability: Embedding a path from a temporary directory in the executable's rpath."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could exploit this by placing malicious shared libraries in the insecure /tmp path, causing PHP to either crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the PHP user (typically 'nobody').",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access is required to place malicious shared libraries in the vulnerable path.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to place files in /tmp. They must also have the knowledge of the specific vulnerability and how to exploit it by placing shared libraries."
