# CVS Server and Client Vulnerabilities — GLSA **200404-13**

There are two vulnerabilities in CVS; one in the server and one in the
client. These vulnerabilities allow the reading and writing of arbitrary
files on both client and server.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-util/cvs** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.11.14** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.11.15** |

### Background

CVS, which stands for Concurrent Versions System, is a client/server
application which tracks changes to sets of files. It allows multiple
users to work concurrently on files, and then merge their changes back
into the main tree (which can be on a remote system). It also allows
branching, or maintaining separate versions for files.

### Description

There are two vulnerabilities in CVS; one in the server and one in the
client. The server vulnerability allows a malicious client to request
the contents of any RCS file to which the server has permission, even
those not located under $CVSROOT. The client vulnerability allows a
malicious server to overwrite files on the client machine anywhere the
client has permissions.

### Impact

Arbitrary files may be read or written on CVS clients and servers by
anybody with access to the CVS tree.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest stable version of CVS.

### Resolution

All CVS users should upgrade to the latest stable version.

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=dev-util/cvs-1.11.15"
 # emerge ">=dev-util/cvs-1.11.15"
```

As a server, it is used to host source code repositories.  As a client, it is used to access such repositories.  This advisory affects both uses of CVS.  A security problem which could allow a server to create arbitrary files on a client machine, and another security problem which may allow a client to view files outside of the CVS repository have been fixed with the release of cvs-1.11.15.  Any sites running CVS should upgrade to the new CVS package.   Here are the details from the Slackware 9.1 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ Sat Apr 17 14:09:23 PDT 2004 patches/packages/cvs-1.11.15-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to cvs-1.11.15.

| [Description](#c0)  gen2daniel    2004-04-14 08:35:46 UTC  ``` Changes since 1.11.14: **********************  SERVER SECURITY ISSUES  * Piped checkouts of paths above $CVSROOT no longer work.  Previously, clients   could have requested the contents of RCS archive files anywhere on a CVS   server.  CLIENT SECURITY ISSUES  * Clients now check paths from the server to verify that they are within one of   the sandboxes the user requested be updated.  Previously, a trojan server   could have written or overwritten files anywhere the user had access,   presenting a serious security risk. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Rainer Größlinger (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-14 08:47:21 UTC  ``` Hi, I already committed a cvs-1.11.15 ebuild about 5 minutes ago ;) I was going to report this to our security guys but then I saw this bug already  I'd like to mark it stable on all archs later today if there are no objections. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-14 08:52:57 UTC  ``` OK -- waiting for stable ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Rainer Größlinger (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-14 11:48:40 UTC  ``` after doing the usual testing, it's now stable on all architectures ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Joshua J. Berry (CondorDes) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-14 12:00:35 UTC  ``` Excellent ... I'll start drafting a GLSA for this. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Joshua J.
