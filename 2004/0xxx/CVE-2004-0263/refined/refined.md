- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When `register_globals` is enabled in the server's `php.ini` and a virtual host sets `php_admin_flag register_globals off`, subsequent requests to other virtual hosts on the same Apache child process may leak the previous host's setting if the other host does not explicitly set the `register_globals`.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of `register_globals` settings across different virtual hosts within the same Apache child process when `register_globals` is enabled server-wide. The vulnerability occurs due to a setting not being reset between requests to different virtual hosts on the same Apache child process.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially exploit leaked global variables to access sensitive information like MySQL passwords, or cause a lack of functionality on the target website. Depending on the server setup and application design, this could range from minor data leakage to complete compromise.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote via HTTP requests. An attacker can exploit this by making requests to different virtual hosts in sequence.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to multiple virtual hosts served by the same Apache instance. This could be done by sending HTTP requests directly.
