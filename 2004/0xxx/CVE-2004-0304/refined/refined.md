**Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection**
*   **Root cause:** User-supplied input in the `browse_items.asp` script is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization leading to SQL injection.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Gaining administrative access to the shopping mall.
    *   Reading any information from the database, including customer data.
    *   Executing arbitrary commands on the server using `xp_cmdshell`.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and needs knowledge of SQL syntax.

**Vulnerability 2: Cross Site Scripting (XSS)**
*   **Root cause:** The `error.asp` script does not properly sanitize user input that is reflected back to the page, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of output encoding/sanitization in `error.asp`, resulting in stored or reflected XSS.
*   **Impact:** Stealing user session IDs and gaining access to personal data.
*  **Attack vectors:** Injecting JavaScript code into the URL parameters that are displayed in `error.asp`.
