## Microsoft Jet Database Engine database request handling buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#740716

Original Release Date: 2004-04-13 | Last Revised: 2004-04-14

---

### Overview

The Microsoft Jet Database Engine (Jet) provides data access functionality to a number of other Microsoft and many third party applications. A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Jet Database Engine that could allow a remote attacker to execute code of their choosing on an affected system.

### Description

| A buffer overflow error exists in the way that a database request is processed by the Microsoft Jet Database Engine. This error results in a vulnerability that could allow remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted database query and sending it through an application that is using Jet on an affected system. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code of their choosing with the same privileges as the user context of the application using the Jet Database Engine. The attacker may be able to leverage these privileges to take complete control of an affected system. Microsoft lists secondary impacts including, but not limited to, installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges. |

### General Information

## Technical Details

**Executive Summary:**

Microsoft updated this bulletin on May 11, 2004 to advise on the availability of a revised version of the security update for non-English versions of Windows XP (as opposed to Windows XP Service Pack 1). The original update does address the vulnerability in Windows XP for all supported languages; however, the original update was not fully localized. Specifically, optional Jet error strings were only being offered in English on Windows XP. This issue does not affect other operating systems. If you have previously applied the security update for other operating systems, including Windows XP Service Pack 1, you need not take any additional action.

If you have previously applied the security update for non-English versions of Windows XP (as opposed to Windows XP Service Pack 1), you need not take any additional action as you are already protected from this vulnerability. However, if you want to have the Jet optional text error information in the same language as your Windows XP installation, you will need to remove the original security update MS04-014 (837001) following the Removal Information procedure located in this document and install the revised version. Once 837001 is uninstalled, revisiting Windows Update will result in the revised MS04-014 security update for Windows XP being re-offered with the correct, localized, optional text error strings.

The following files, on non-English systems only, were updated as part of this update: **mswstr10.dll** and **msjint40.dll**. You may see other files with new Date and Time information from the original release - these files remain unchanged, only the 2 files above have been updated.

A [buffer overrun](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Jet Database Engine (Jet) that could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges.

Microsoft recommends that customers install the update at the earliest opportunity.

**I am running Windows NT 4.0, how do I know if I have Jet installed?**

Windows NT 4.0 does not include the Jet Database Engine by default. However, the Jet Database Engine is used by many applications and could have been installed on your system by an application such as Microsoft Office or Microsoft Visual Studio. Jet is also available as a stand-alone download. To determine if the Jet Database Engine is present on your system, search for the file named **Msjet40.dll**. If this file is present, this security update is required.

**Where can I find the security update for Jet for Windows NT 4.0?**

Although Jet is considered a Windows component, it is not part of the Windows NT 4.0 default installation. Therefore, this update is not available through Windows Update. The security update for Windows NT 4.0 is available for download at the following [location](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=7678462a-52ec-48d5-9aeb-46ec4cc053c7&displaylang;=en).

**If I have the Msjet40.dll file on my system, how do I know if I am vulnerable?**

To determine if you are vulnerable, compare the file version of the **Msjet40.dll** file installed on your computer to the file version found in the Security Update Information section. If the version of **Msjet40.dll** is lower than **4.0.8618.0**, you are vulnerable and need to apply this security update.

**How does the extended support for Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition affect the release of security updates for these operating systems?**

## Vulnerability Details

#### Jet Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0197:

A [buffer overrun](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Jet Database Engine (Jet) that could allow remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted database query and sending it through an application that is using Jet on an affected system. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges.

#### Mitigating Factors for Jet Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0197:

* Windows NT 4.0 does not contain a version of the Microsoft Jet Database Engine (Jet) by default. However, other applications such as Microsoft Office or Microsoft Visual Studio could have installed Jet. Jet is also available as a stand-alone download. To determine if Jet is present on a system, search for the file named **Msjet40.dll**. If this file exists, this security update is required.
* If the application that is communicating with Jet is using strong input validation, it is possible to filter the malicious input that an attacker is trying to submit to the Jet engine. Strong input validation means that all input is considered to be not trusted. Developing with strong input validation is considered to be a best practice. For more information about best practice application development and about application input validation, visit the [MSDN Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa302420).
* If an attacker successfully exploited this vulnerability, they would gain the same privileges as the user context of the application. Users or services whose accounts are configured to have few privileges on the system would be at less risk than users or services that operate with administrative or system privileges.

#### Workarounds for Jet Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0197:

None

#### FAQ for Jet Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0197:

**Note** When you install this security update on Windows Server 2003 or on Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003, the installer checks to see if any of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [824994](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=824994).

**Verifying Update Installation**

To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool, which allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP1\KB837001\Filelist

**Note** This registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 837001 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows XP (all versions)

**Note** For Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003, this security update is the same as the Windows Server 2003 64-Bit Edition security update.

**Prerequisites**
This security update requires the released version of Windows XP or Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1). For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [322389](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;322389).
