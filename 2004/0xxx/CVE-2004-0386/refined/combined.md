How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Geert Bevin    2002-01-31 14:17:33 UTC  ``` Packages should not perform configuration with pkg_config anymore, but instead install a file in /var/config. The file has this format '01packagename.sh'. Portage could have convenience functions to auto generate the numbers. Additionally packages can put important informative messages in the same location but then as '01packagename.txt'. Portage can have options to auto execute new config scripts and auto show new messages. It however always gives the status of the /var/config dir. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Geert Bevin    2002-01-31 14:19:45 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 461](show_bug.cgi?id=461 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Need post_install_note() function") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-21 01:20:36 UTC  ``` I'll add this soon.

While on a similar subject, is there a way to keep a variable assignment between the different parts of an ebuild?  ie, set a variable in src_install and get it again in pkg_config or in the new set?  this would be good for cases like "check the files installed "there" and perform an action on them.  Sure, this could be handled by manually checking files and typing down names, but this makes for a lot of errors by ebuild creators.   ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Wout Mertens (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-05-12 12:15:32 UTC  ``` For keeping vars: I guess you could do env>${TEMPDIR}/vars and . ${TEMPDIR}/vars in the functions?   ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-12-02 05:09:11 UTC  ``` Are this stil in the pipeline, or something else planned ?  ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-12-10 10:22:48 UTC  ``` Still in the pipeline.

# Remote buffer overflow in MPlayer — GLSA **200403-13**

MPlayer contains a remotely exploitable buffer overflow in the HTTP parser
that may allow attackers to run arbitrary code on a user's computer.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/mplayer** on the x86 sparc architecture |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.92** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.92-r1** |

| Package | **media-video/mplayer** on the amd64 architecture |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.0\_pre2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0\_pre2-r1** |

| Package | **media-video/mplayer** on the ppc architecture |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.0\_pre3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0\_pre3-r3** |

### Background

Quote from http://mplayerhq.hu

"MPlayer is a movie player for LINUX (runs on many other Unices, and
non-x86 CPUs, see the documentation). It plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI,
OGG/OGM, VIVO, ASF/WMA/WMV, QT/MOV/MP4, FLI, RM, NuppelVideo, YUV4MPEG,
FILM, RoQ, PVA files, supported by many native, XAnim, and Win32 DLL
codecs. You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX 3/4/5 and even WMV
movies, too."

### Description

A vulnerability exists in the MPlayer HTTP parser which may allow an
attacker to craft a special HTTP header ("Location:") which will trick
MPlayer into executing arbitrary code on the user's computer.

### Impact

An attacker without privileges may exploit this vulnerability remotely,
allowing arbitrary code to be executed in order to gain unauthorized
access.

### Workaround

A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are
advised to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.

### Resolution

MPlayer may be upgraded as follows:

x86 and SPARC users should:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=media-video/mplayer-0.92-r1"
 # emerge ">=media-video/mplayer-0.92-r1"
```

AMD64 users should:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_pre2-r1"
 # emerge ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_pre2-r1"
```

PPC users should:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_pre3-r2"
 # emerge ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_pre3-r2"
```

## MPlayer contains a buffer overflow in the HTTP parser

#### Vulnerability Note VU#723910

Original Release Date: 2004-04-09 | Last Revised: 2004-04-09

---

### Overview

MPlayer fails to properly allocate a memory buffer for URL strings containing characters that need to be escaped.

### Description

| MPlayer is a movie player for Linux and other Unix-based operating systems. MPlayer fails to properly allocate a memory buffer for URL strings containing characters that need to be escaped. When escaping characters in a URL, a single character may be replaced by three. For instance, the space character may be replaced by %20. There is a vulnerability in the way MPlayer allocates memory to store the escaped representation of the URL. By sending a "Location" HTTP header containing an overly long URL with many un-escaped characters, an attacker can trigger a buffer overflow.  According to the [MPlayer Advisory](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/design6/news.html), the following versions are affected:     + MPlayer 0.90pre series + MPlayer 0.90rc series + MPlayer 0.90 + MPlayer 0.91 + MPlayer 1.0pre1 + MPlayer 1.0pre2 + MPlayer 1.0pre3 |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to play a media file containing a specially crafted "Location" HTTP header, an attacker could cause MPlayer to crash or potentially execute code of the attacker's choice with privileges of the victim. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**According to the [MPlayer Advisory](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/design6/news.html), users of MPlayer 1.0pre3 should upgrade to the latest CVS. MPlayer 0.92 (and below) users should upgrade to 0.92.1 or the latest CVS.**Apply Patch**Apply a patch as specified by your vendor. If a patch is unavailable from your vendor, the maintainers of MPlayer have provided a patch for all vulnerable versions. This patch can be obtained from:<http://www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/patches/vuln02-fix.diff> |
