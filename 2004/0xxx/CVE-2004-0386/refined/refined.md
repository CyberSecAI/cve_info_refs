Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-0386:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the MPlayer HTTP parser.
*   MPlayer fails to properly allocate memory for URL strings, specifically when handling characters that require escaping (e.g., space character becomes %20).
*   When MPlayer escapes a character, a single character may be replaced by three.  The software does not correctly account for this when allocating memory, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:**  The core issue is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the HTTP parser, triggered by an overly long URL with unescaped characters in the "Location:" HTTP header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system, with the privileges of the user running MPlayer. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Application Crash:**  Exploitation can cause MPlayer to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a specially crafted HTTP header.
*   **Malicious Media File:** An attacker can create a malicious media file that contains a crafted "Location" header with an overly long URL that triggers the overflow.  The victim would need to open the malicious file in MPlayer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create or modify a media file or control an HTTP server accessed by the user which can serve a crafted "Location:" HTTP header with an overly long URL.
*   The attacker doesn't need special privileges on the target system to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The user must use the vulnerable version of MPlayer and be tricked into opening a malicious file or connecting to the attacker's controlled server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200403-13) provides specific details on affected versions of MPlayer across different architectures (x86, sparc, amd64, and ppc)
*   The CERT vulnerability note (VU#723910) mentions that versions 0.90pre series, 0.90rc series, 0.90, 0.91, 1.0pre1, 1.0pre2, and 1.0pre3 are affected.
*   A patch was available from MPlayer developers for all vulnerable versions (`http://www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/patches/vuln02-fix.diff`).
*   The vulnerability can be triggered when opening a malicious file or accessing an attacker-controlled server.
