      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the way Internet Explorer processes script within image tags, allowing for a file download without user consent.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Privilege elevation vulnerability: An attacker can use this vulnerability to save files on the user's system without prompting for user interaction.",

      "impact": "An attacker could save malicious code to the user's local file system. While the code cannot be directly executed via this vulnerability, the operating system might open the file if saved to a sensitive location or the user may inadvertently run it, leading to complete control of the affected system.",

        "Web-based attack: The attacker hosts a malicious website and persuades a user to visit it or click a malicious link.",
        "Email-based attack: The attacker sends a malicious HTML email that, when viewed, triggers the vulnerability."
