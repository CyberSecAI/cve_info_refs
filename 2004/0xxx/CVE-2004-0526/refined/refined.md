Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how Internet Explorer and potentially Outlook Express handle HTML `<a>` (anchor) tags with nested `<img>` (image) tags and `<map>` elements. Specifically, the issue is related to how these browsers determine the link destination when an image with a usemap is part of the anchor tag. In this case, the `alt` attribute of the image and the `alt` attribute of the map are used to spoof the actual location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **URL Spoofing:** The core vulnerability is that the displayed text and the displayed image source can be made to show a legitimate URL (e.g., `http://www.microsoft.com`), while the actual link (defined within the `<area>` tag of the `<map>`) points to a malicious site (e.g., `http://www.malware.com`). This can be used to trick users into clicking a link they believe is safe.
*   **Misleading ALT Text:** The `alt` attributes are used in a misleading way. The anchor and map elements alt text is set to a legitimate domain (e.g. microsoft.com), while the link within the map points to a different one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to craft convincing phishing emails or webpages that appear to be legitimate, tricking users into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can direct users to download malicious files by disguising the URL that it points to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email:** This attack can be delivered through HTML formatted emails.
*   **Web Pages:** Malicious HTML code could be placed on a website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTML-formatted emails or control the content of a web page.
*   No special network access is required beyond what would normally be needed to send emails or host web pages.
*   The attacker needs to craft the HTML containing the vulnerable structure.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided example shows a working example as a zip file.
*   Outlook 2003 is stated to correctly handle the link, suggesting that the issue might have been fixed in later versions.
