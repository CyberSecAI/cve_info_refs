## Vulnerability Details

#### Windows Kernel Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0893:

A [privilege elevation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows Kernel launches applications. This vulnerability could allow a logged on user to take complete control of the system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Kernel Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0893:

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
* Attempts to exploit this vulnerability on systems that are running Windows XP Service Pack 2 or Windows Server 2003 would most likely result in a denial of service condition.

#### Workarounds for Windows Kernel Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0893:

We have not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for Windows Kernel Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0893:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [privilege elevation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges. To attempt to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must be able to log on locally to the system and run a program.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in a Local Procedure Call (LPC) interface does not validate the restriction that is put on the size of data that is sent through an LPC Port.

**What is LPC?**

LPC is a message-passing service that is provided by Windows. This service allows threads and processes to communicate with each other. When a client process must request a service from a server process, there must be a way for the two processes to communicate with each other. There must be a way for the client process to make requests of the server, for the server to send responses to the client, and for each to determine their status. When the client process and the server process are located on different systems, Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is used. When they are located on the same system, LPC can be used.

**What are LPC Ports?**

Every LPC has a collection of communications channels that are known as LPC ports. Each port carries one type of communication. For example, an LPC will always have a port that is used to allow one client to send messages to the server and a port that allows the server to send messages to each client. The LPC will also have other ports for other purposes, such as ports that allow threads within a process to coordinate their requests.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must be able to log on locally to a system and run a program.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially-designed application that could exploit the vulnerability, and thereby gain complete control over the affected system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers are only at risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative credentials are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

No. An attacker must be able to log on to the specific system that is targeted for attack. An attacker cannot load and run a program remotely by using this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Windows Kernel validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### LSASS Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0894:

A [privilege elevation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in the way that the LSASS validates identity tokens. This vulnerability could allow a logged on user to take complete control of the system.

#### Mitigating Factors for LSASS Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0894:

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users. However, as soon as an attacker had complete control of an affected system an attacker may be able to use that system to attack other network resources.
* Windows NT 4.0 Server is not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for LSASS Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0894:

We have not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for LSASS Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0894:

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges. To attempt to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must be able to log on locally to the system and run a program.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Incomplete validation of connection information by the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service.

**What is LSASS?**

The Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) provides an interface for managing local security, domain authentication, and Active Directory service processes. It handles authentication for the client and for the server. The LSASS also contains features that are used to support Active Directory utilities.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges.

**Notes** The Windows XP and Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 versions of this security update are packaged as dual-mode packages. These dual-mode packages contain files for the original version of Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1) and files for Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2).
For more information about dual-mode packages, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 328848](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/328848).
When you install this security update on Windows XP SP2 or on Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, one of the following conditions occurs, depending on your operating system:

* Windows XP SP2
  The installer copies the SP2QFE files to your system.
* Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003
  The installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system.

If you have not previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, one of the following conditions occurs, depending on your operating system:

* Windows XP SP2
  The installer copies the SP2GDR files to your system.
* Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003
  The installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system.

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

**Verifying Update Installation**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. This tool allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Hotfix\KB885835\File 1

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 885835 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and to perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, see the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
