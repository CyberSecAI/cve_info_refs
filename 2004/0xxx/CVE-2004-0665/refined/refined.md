{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The csFAQ script does not properly handle user-supplied input to the 'database' parameter, allowing the injection of a path traversal string.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Full path disclosure due to improper input validation and handling in the 'database' parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can determine the full path to the web root directory, which may disclose other sensitive information about the server and system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP request to the csFAQ script, providing the path traversal string in the 'database' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable csFAQ script."
