Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2004-0839:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) handles drag-and-drop operations, specifically when dealing with image elements (`IMG` tags) in HTML. IE improperly validates the source of the image, treating any file referenced by an IMG tag as a valid image, regardless of its actual content. This allows arbitrary files, including executables, to be disguised as images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation: IE does not verify if the file referenced in an IMG tag's `SRC` or `DYNSRC` attribute is actually an image.
- Drag-and-drop handling: IE copies files instead of prompting the user for download when a drag-and-drop operation is performed on an image.
- Privilege elevation: Allows malicious code to be copied to sensitive locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file copy: An attacker can trick a user into copying a malicious file, such as an executable, to the local filesystem by using drag-and-drop on a disguised IMG element.
- Code execution: If the malicious code is placed in the Windows Startup folder, it will be executed automatically when the user logs in, leading to complete system compromise if the user has admin rights.
- Arbitrary code execution can be achieved by other means, after the file has been copied to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based: An attacker hosts a malicious webpage containing an IMG tag referencing the malicious file (using `SRC` or `DYNSRC` attributes). The user is lured to visit the page and drag-and-drop the fake image.
- Email-based: Similar to web-based, but the malicious HTML is embedded in an email message.
- GUI spoofing: An attacker could use other vulnerabilities to manipulate window objects and GUI elements to more easily trick the user into performing the drag and drop action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host a webpage or send an email containing malicious HTML.
- Knowledge of where to place the malicious code (e.g. Windows Startup folder) for automatic execution.
- Ability to convince the user to visit the malicious page or view the email and perform the drag-and-drop.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is a privilege elevation issue since it allows an attacker to copy files to locations they would not otherwise have write access to.
- User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. The user has to perform the drag-and-drop operation.
- The vulnerability is also known as the "Scroll Bar Vulnerability" in some security communities.
- Patches were released in [MS04-038](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-038.mspx), where the drag-and-drop handling for image elements was improved to validate images.
