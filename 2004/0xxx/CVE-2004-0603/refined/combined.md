# gzip: Insecure creation of temporary files — GLSA **200406-18**

gzip contain a bug potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary
commands.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/gzip** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.3.3-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.3-r4** |

### Background

gzip (GNU zip) is popular compression program. The included gzexe
utility allows you to compress executables in place and have them
automatically uncompress and execute when you run them.

### Description

The script gzexe included with gzip contains a bug in the code that
handles tempfile creation. If the creation of a temp file fails when
using gzexe fails instead of bailing out it executes the command given
as argument.

### Impact

This could lead to priviege escalation by running commands under the
rights of the user running the self extracting file.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version.

### Resolution

All gzip users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=app-arch/gzip-1.3.3-r4"
 # emerge ">=app-arch/gzip-1.3.3-r4"
```

Additionally, once the upgrade is complete, all self extracting files
created with earlier versions gzexe should be recreated, since the
vulnerability is actually embedded in those executables.

### References

* [CVE-2004-0603](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2004-0603)

**Release date**

June 24, 2004

**Latest revision**

May 22, 2006: 02

**Severity**

normal

**Exploitable**
