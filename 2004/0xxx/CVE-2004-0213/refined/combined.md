## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces a prior security bulletin. The security bulletin ID and operating systems that are affected are listed in the table below.

| Bulletin ID | Windows NT 4.0 | Windows 2000 | Windows XP | Windows Server 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [**MS03-025**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=17773) | Not Applicable | Replaced | Not Applicable | Not Applicable |

**Does this update contain any other changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin, this update includes the following change in functionality. Utility Manger is no longer able to use context-sensitive help. This feature has been removed to provide greater security and to help prevent potential malicious use. Microsoft considers this to be a defense-in-depth measure that we are taking to help provide additional protection against future malicious use of Utility Manager.

**I'm still using Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, but extended security update support ended on June 30, 2004. However, this bulletin has a security update for this operating system version. Why is that?**

Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 reached the end of their life cycle as previously documented, and Microsoft extended this support to June 30, 2004. However, the end-of-life for the extended support period occurred very recently. In this case, the majority of the steps that are required to address this vulnerability were completed before June 30, 2004. Therefore, we have decided to release a security update for this operating system version as part of this security bulletin. We do not anticipate doing this for future vulnerabilities affecting this operating system version, but we reserve the right to produce updates and to make these updates available when necessary.

It should be a priority for customers who have this operating system version to migrate to a supported version to prevent potential exposure to future vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Life Cycle, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for this operating system version, visit the following [Microsoft Product Support Services Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;%5bln%5d;lifeanoct2003).

For more information, see the [Windows Operating System FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;%5bln%5d;lifewinfaq).

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA will determine if this update is required. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**Note** After April 20, 2004, the Mssecure.xml file that is used by MBSA 1.1.1 and earlier versions is no longer being updated with new security bulletin data. Therefore, scans that are performed after that date with MBSA 1.1.1 or earlier will be incomplete. All users should upgrade to MBSA 1.2 because it provides more accurate security update detection and supports additional products. Users can download MBSA 1.2 from the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about MBSA support, visit the following [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsaqa.mspx)[1.2 Q&A; Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsaqa.mspx).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

## Vulnerability Details

#### Mitigating Factors for Utility Manager Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0213:

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to logon locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
* Windows NT 4.0, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 are not affected by this vulnerability. Windows NT 4.0 does not implement Utility Manager.
* The [Windows 2000 Hardening Guide](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=15e83186-a2c8-4c8f-a9d0-a0201f639a56&displaylang;=en) recommends disabling the Utility Manger service. Environments that comply with these guidelines would be at a reduced risk from this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Utility Manager Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0213:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

**Use the Group Policy settings to disable Utility Manager on all affected systems that do not require this feature.**

Because Utility Manager is a possible attack vector, disable it by using the Group Policy settings. The Utility Manager process name is Utilman.exe. The following guide provides information about how to require users to run only approved applications by using the [Group Policy](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/howto/grpolwt.mspx) settings.

**Note** You may also review the [Windows 2000 Hardening Guide](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=15e83186-a2c8-4c8f-a9d0-a0201f639a56&displaylang;=en). This guide includes information about how to disable Utility Manager.

**Impact of Workaround:** Utility Manager provides easy access to many of the accessibility features of the operating system. This access would be unavailable until the restrictions are removed. For more information about how to start many of the accessibility features manually, visit the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windows2000/default.aspx).

#### FAQ for Utility Manager Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0213:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [privilege elevation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The process that Utility Manager uses to launch applications. It is possible that Utility Manager could launch applications with system privileges.

**What is Utility Manager?**

Utility Manager is an [accessibility utility](https://www.microsoft.com/enable/at/default.aspx) that allows users to determine the status of accessibility programs such as Microsoft Magnifier, Narrator, or On-Screen Keyboard, and to start or stop them.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker must be able to log on to the system and then, after starting Utility Manager, run a program that sends a specially crafted message to Utility Manager to attempt to exploit the vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to start Utility Manager on Windows 2000 and then run a specially designed application that could exploit the vulnerability. In default configurations of Window 2000, Utility Manager is installed but is not running. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain complete control over a Windows 2000 system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Windows 2000 systems are affected by this vulnerability. Workstations and terminal servers that are based on Windows 2000 are primarily at risk. Servers are only at risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative credentials are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**I am using Windows 2000, but I am not using Utility Manager or any of the accessibility features. Am I still vulnerable?**

Yes. By default, Utility Manager is installed and is enabled. However, Utility Manager is not running by default.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

No. An attacker must be able to log on to the specific system that is targeted for attack. An attacker cannot load and run a program remotely by using this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

This update removes the vulnerability by removing the Utility Manager's ability to launch certain applications.

**How does this vulnerability relate to the Utility Manager vulnerability that is addressed by MS04-011?**

Both vulnerabilities are related to Utility Manager. However, this update corrects a new vulnerability that was not addressed as part of MS04-011. MS04-011 helps protect against the vulnerability that is discussed in that bulletin, but it does not address this new vulnerability. This update does not replace MS04-011. You must install this update and the update that is provided as part of the MS04-011 security bulletin to help protect your system from both vulnerabilities.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. This tool allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results pane**, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name box**, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB842526\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 842526 security update into the Windows installation source files.
