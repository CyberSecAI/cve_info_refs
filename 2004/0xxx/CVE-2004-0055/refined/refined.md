      "cve": "CVE-2004-0055",
      "source": "marc.info_3246502c_20250125_074425.html",
       "root_cause": "The `print_attr_string()` function in `print-radius.c` does not properly validate the length and data attributes from RADIUS packets. Specifically, the for loop within this function is unsafe and doesn't check 'length' and 'data' parameters which can lead to out-of-bounds reads.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can send a specially crafted RADIUS packet to a system running tcpdump, causing a segmentation fault and potentially a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vector": "Network; Specifically, the attacker sends a malicious RADIUS packet.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the target system, specifically RADIUS packets."

      "source": "www.kb.cert.org_5573aafa_20250125_074430.html",
      "root_cause": "The `print_attr_string()` function within `print-radius.c` in tcpdump improperly parses RADIUS attributes. It does not check the length values of attributes, allowing an overly long length value to cause a crash.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can trigger a denial of service or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by sending a crafted RADIUS packet.",
      "attack_vector": "Network, specifically through the reception of a crafted RADIUS packet.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a malicious RADIUS packet to a vulnerable system running `tcpdump`."

      "source": "marc.info_a37a981a_20250125_074423.html",
      "root_cause": "A flaw exists in the `print_attr_string` function within the RADIUS decoding routines of tcpdump, specifically due to lack of proper input validation of the length field of a RADIUS attribute.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
         "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending carefully crafted packets, resulting in a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution as the 'pcap' user.",
      "attack_vector": "Network, by sending malicious RADIUS packets.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send specifically crafted RADIUS packets to a system that is using a vulnerable version of tcpdump."
