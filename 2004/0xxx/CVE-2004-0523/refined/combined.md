 Description
 -----------

  kerberos5:
  * The krb5_aname_to_localname() library function contains multiple
    buffer overflows which could be exploited to gain unauthorized root
    access.  Exploitation of these flaws requires an unusual combination
    of factors, including successful authentication to a vulnerable
    service and a non-default configuration on the target service. This
    flaw effects all releases of MIT Kerberos 5 [[0]](#0), up to and including
    krb5-1.3.3.

    This problem has been assigned the id MITKRB5-SA-2004-001 [[1]](#1).

MIT Kerberos 5 contains several heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities in code that translates Kerberos principal names to local UNIX account names. An authenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with root privileges.

### Description

| MIT Kerberos 5 contains several heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities in a library that translates Kerberos principal names to local UNIX account names. From [MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2004-001](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2004-001-an_to_ln.txt):  krb5\_aname\_to\_localname() translates a Kerberos principal name to a local account name, typically a UNIX username.  In the file src/lib/krb5/os/an\_to\_ln.c, the helper functions aname\_replacer(), do\_replacement(), and rule\_an\_to\_ln() do not perform adequate checks of the lengths of strings which contain the name of the principal whose authorization is being checked.In addition, the implementation of the explicit mapping functionality in krb5\_aname\_to\_localname() consistently writes a zero byte at a location one byte past the end of a heap buffer when handling a principal name matching an explicit mapping.Further technical details, including a patch against krb5-1.3.3, are available in [MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2004-001](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2004-001-an_to_ln.txt).Only kerberos enabled services that enable explicit or rules-based krb5\_aname\_to\_localname() mapping are vulnerable. In the case of the explicit mapping vulnerability, the attacker would need to authenticate using a principal name that is present in the explicit mapping list. In the case of the rules-based mapping vulnerabilities, the attacker would need the ability to create specially crafted principal names in the local realm or in a realm accessible via cross-realm authentication. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An authenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on a system using krb5\_aname\_to\_localname() mapping. The vulnerable library is loaded by services that use Kerberos authentication (e.g., telnetd, klogind), and in most cases these services run with root privileges. |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch or upgrade**Apply the patch referenced in [MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2004-001](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2004-001-an_to_ln.txt) or upgrade to MIT krb5-1.3.4. Alternatively, apply the appropriate patch or upgrade as specified by your vendor. |

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2004-149
2004-06-04
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Product     : Fedora Core 1
Name        : krb5
Version     : 1.3.3
Release     : 6
Summary     : The Kerberos network authentication system.
Description :
Kerberos V5 is a trusted-third-party network authentication system,
which can improve your network's security by eliminating the insecure
practice of cleartext passwords.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Bugs have been fixed in the krb5_aname_to_localname library function.
Specifically, buffer overflows were possible for all Kerberos
versions up to and including 1.3.3. The krb5_aname_to_localname
function translates a Kerberos principal name to a local account
name, typically a UNIX username.  This function is frequently used
when performing authorization checks.

If configured with mappings from particular Kerberos principals to
particular UNIX user names, certain functions called by
krb5_aname_to_localname will not properly check the lengths of
buffers used to store portions of the principal name. If configured
to map principals to user names using rules, krb5_aname_to_localname
would consistently write one byte past the end of a buffer allocated
from the heap. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0523 to this issue.

Only configurations which enable the explicit mapping or rules-based
mapping functionality of krb5_aname_to_localname() are vulnerable.
These configurations are not the default.

                 MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2004-001

2004-06-01

Topic: buffer overflows in krb5_aname_to_localname

Severity: serious

SUMMARY
=======

The krb5_aname_to_localname() library function contains multiple
buffer overflows which could be exploited to gain unauthorized root
access.  Exploitation of these flaws requires an unusual combination
of factors, including successful authentication to a vulnerable
service and a non-default configuration on the target service.  (See
MITIGATING FACTORS below.)  No exploits are known to exist yet.

IMPACT
======

A remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on hosts
running vulnerable services.

MITIGATING FACTORS
==================

Only configurations which enable the explicit mapping or rules-based
mapping functionality of krb5_aname_to_localname() are vulnerable.
These configurations are not the default.

If the explicit mapping functionality is enabled, an attacker must
authenticate using a principal name listed in the explicit mapping
list.

If the rules-based mapping functionality is enabled, an attacker must
be able to create arbitrary principal names either in the local
Kerberos realm or in a remote realm from which the local realm's
services are reachable by cross-realm authentication.

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

All releases of MIT Kerberos 5, up to and including krb5-1.3.3.

The upcoming krb5-1.3.4 release will contain a fix for this problem.

Affected services contained in these releases include the remote login
applications (e.g., ftp, rsh, rlogin, telnet), as well as ksu.
Third-party application servers using the affected functionality of
the krb5 library may be vulnerable.

These services are only vulnerable in non-default configurations.

FIXES
=====

* If you are using the vulnerable functionality, consider disabling it
  immediately.  Complete disabling of any configuration of explicit
  mapping or rules-based mapping should prevent exploitation.

* The upcoming krb5-1.3.4 release will contain a fix for this problem.

* Apply the following patch to src/lib/krb5/os/an_to_ln.c, and
  recompile the affected libraries and applications.

DETAILS
=======

krb5_aname_to_localname() translates a Kerberos principal name to a
local account name, typically a UNIX username.  In the file
src/lib/krb5/os/an_to_ln.c, the helper functions aname_replacer(),
do_replacement(), and rule_an_to_ln() do not perform adequate checks
of the lengths of strings which contain the name of the principal
whose authorization is being checked.  This can result in the overflow
of heap buffers when an attacker authenticates using a sufficiently
long principal name.

In addition, the implementation of the explicit mapping functionality
in krb5_aname_to_localname() consistently writes a zero byte at a
location one byte past the end of a heap buffer when handling a
principal name matching an explicit mapping.  Single-byte overflows of
heap buffers are known to be exploitable on some architectures.  The
vulnerability in the explicit mapping functionality was fixed around
December 2003 in the development sources, but the fix was not
propagated to the krb5-1.3.x release branch.

# mit-krb5: Multiple buffer overflows in krb5\_aname\_to\_localname — GLSA **200406-21**

mit-krb5 contains multiple buffer overflows in the function
krb5\_aname\_to\_localname(). This could potentially lead to a complete remote
system compromise.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-crypt/mit-krb5** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.3.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.3-r1** |

### Background

mit-krb5 is the free implementation of the Kerberos network authentication
protocol by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

### Description

The library function krb5\_aname\_to\_localname() contains multiple buffer
overflows. This is only exploitable if explicit mapping or rules-based
mapping is enabled. These are not enabled as default.

With explicit mapping enabled, an attacker must authenticate using a
principal name listed in the explicit mapping list.

With rules-based mapping enabled, an attacker must first be able to create
arbitrary principal names either in the local realm Kerberos realm or in a
remote realm from which the local realm's service are reachable by
cross-realm authentication.

### Impact

An attacker could use these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with
the permissions of the user running mit-krb5, which could be the root user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version.

### Resolution

mit-krb5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.3.3-r1"
 # emerge ">=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.3.3-r1"
```
