      "impact": "A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating symbolic links in the temporary files directory, pointing to an arbitrary file on the filesystem. When cscope is executed, it would overwrite the target file with the rights of the user running cscope, potentially leading to system file corruption if cscope is run with root privileges.",
