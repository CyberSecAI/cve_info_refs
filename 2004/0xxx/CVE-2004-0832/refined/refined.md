{
  "CVE-2004-0832": {
    "Description": "Squid 2.5.x versions contain a bug in the functions ntlm_fetch_string() and ntlm_get_string() which lack checking the int32_t offset \"o\" for negative values.",
    "Root cause": "The functions `ntlm_fetch_string()` and `ntlm_get_string()` in Squid 2.5.x do not validate the integer offset 'o' for negative values.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Lack of bounds checking"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending specially crafted NTLMSSP packets. This can crash the Squid NTLM helpers, effectively disrupting the proxy service.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending malformed NTLMSSP packets to a Squid proxy with NTLM authentication enabled."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to send network traffic to the Squid proxy.",
       "Knowledge of the NTLM authentication protocol to craft malicious packets."
    ]
  }
