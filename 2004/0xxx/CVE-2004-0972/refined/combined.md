# Security Contacts and Procedures

Red Hat takes security very seriously, and we aim to take immediate action to
address serious security-related problems that involve our products or
services.

Please report any suspected security vulnerability in a Red Hat product or service to Red Hat Product Security at secalert@redhat.com. You can use our [GPG key](#contact) to communicate with us securely.

To report an issue in any Red Hat branded website or online service, please contact Red Hat Information Security at site-security@redhat.com.

## When to contact Red Hat Product Security

You should contact Red Hat Product Security if:

* You think there might be a security vulnerability in a Red Hat product or service.
* You want to provide feedback about our standards of service and performance. If you feel your security concern is not dealt with in a satisfactory manner, please contact secalert@redhat.com.

In all other cases, you should contact [Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement](/site/support/).

You should contact Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement if:

* You are unsure about how a known vulnerability affects a Red Hat product or service.
* You wish to report an issue in a language other than English.
* You require technical assistance for a security function (for example, "How do I configure my firewall?").
* You need help upgrading packages due to security alerts. (Refer to "How do I apply package updates from the Red Hat Network?" for information on upgrading packages.)
* Your issue is not security related.

In any of these cases, please contact [Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement](/site/support/) instead.

## Who reads email sent to secalert@redhat.com?

Only members of Red Hat Product Security, a restricted
and carefully chosen group of Red Hat employees, will have access to
material sent to the secalert@redhat.com address. No outside users can subscribe to this list.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities in Red Hat Offerings

Red Hat Product Security welcomes and encourages all potential vulnerability submissions. For us to provide the best customer service and address issues in a timely manner, please provide the following information, if known:

* The version number of the affected component, such as the rpm package, container image, and java component.
* The environment and corresponding version(s) where the issue was discovered, for example, the operating system's name, version, architecture, or container platform.
* The steps to reproduce, if available.
* The ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability on a system.
* Is the vulnerability already known to the public? If not, when is the planned date for disclosure?
* The immediate impact if an attacker exploits the vulnerability, such as a denial of service, privilege escalation, or remote code execution.

## How to contact us securely

Red Hat Product Security uses an OpenPGP key to secure our email communications. Mail sent to secalert@redhat.com can be encrypted with this public key. We expect to change the key we use from time to time. Should we change the key, the previous keys will be revoked, and the [rhsa-announce](http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rhsa-announce) mailing list will be notified of the change.

#### DCE3823597F5EAC4: Red Hat, Inc. (Product Security)

This key is used for communicating securely with Red Hat Product Security and for signing the security advisories posted to mailing lists.

**Download:** [Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/security/data/97f5eac4.txt)

**Fingerprint:** 77E7 9ABE 9367 3533 ED09 EBE2 DCE3 8235 97F5 EAC4

Please do not send messages encrypted with this public key to any address
other than security@redhat.com and secalert@redhat.com. We are unable to accept any non–security-related email that is encrypted with this public key.

## How we respond

Email sent to secalert@redhat.com is read and
acknowledged with a non-automated response within three working
days. For issues that are complicated and require significant attention, we will open an investigation and will provide you with a mechanism to check the status of our progress at any time.

Any information you share with us about security issues that are
not public knowledge is kept confidential within Red Hat. It is not
passed on to any third party without your permission.

## Notifications

Red Hat does not provide an advance notification service. Security
advisories are available from [Red Hat Product Security](/site/security/updates/) and via the [Red Hat Customer Portal](/site/security/updates/active/).

## Common Criteria Timely Updates

Refer to the [Life Cycle Security Update Policy](https://access.redhat.com/security/lifecycle-security-update-policy) for information on Red Hat's security update policy as well as information on embargoed (undisclosed) vulnerability handling.

### Resources include the following:

[Red Hat Security Updates (Advisories)](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/security-advisories)

[Red Hat CVE Database](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/cve)

[Red Hat Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) Program](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cve_program)

## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)

Red Hat engages with partners, vendors, researchers, and community coordinators to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and services. Multi-party coordination is a complex process, and understanding the parties' vulnerability disclosure policies, vulnerability handling policies, and contractual agreements opens the way to trusted communication and collaboration. Increasing transparency between parties assures that vendors can understand and manage the risk imposed by the vulnerability and facilitate engagements with other parties. The aim of CVD is to provide timely and consistent guidance to parties and customers to help them protect themselves.

Please see the [Red Hat CNA Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cna_vulnerability_disclosure_policy) for details on how Red Hat discloses security vulnerabilities under the Red Hat/Fedora scope.

For more information on CVD, please review the information provided in the following links:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=124647#c0)  Rafael 'Dido' Sevilla    2004-05-28 06:56:38 UTC  ``` From Bugzilla Helper: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040429 Firefox/0.8  Description of problem: We have been attempting to make use of the Linux Logical Volume Manager on EMC PowerPath pseudo-devices. We are using the 3.0.6 version of the PowerPath driver on an EMC Clariion storage appliance.  An attempt to create a physical volume on a PowerPath device fails with an invalid device error.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): kernel-smp-2.4.21-9.0  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1.Create EMC PowerPath devices 2.Attempt to create an LVM physical volume using pvcreate       Actual Results:  Invalid device error  Expected Results:  Success of the physical volume creation  Additional info:  We have been advised by EMC that what we are doing is unsupported by the driver, but we are wondering what other options are available.  Do other Red Hat ES/AS versions suffer from this difficulty? Are other volume management solutions usable (e.g. IBM EVMS or others)?   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=124647#c1)  Arjan van de Ven    2004-05-28 07:36:42 UTC  ``` It's probably better if you file a support request for this and not a bugzilla bug. our support people have the infrastructure to escalate issues with the EMC binary only kernel modules to EMC, we in  engineering can't really do that with bugzilla.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=124647#c2)  Heinz Mauelshagen    2004-05-28 13:13:43 UTC  ``` Covered in lvm-1_0_8-2   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=124647#c3)  Jay Turner    2004-09-02 02:17:46 UTC  ```  An errata has been issued which should help the problem  described in this bug report.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=136308#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2004-10-19 09:53:31 UTC  ``` On September 10th 2004, Trustix shared some temporary file vulnerabilities with vendor-sec.  After some refinement these were made public on Sep30.  These are minor issues (impact: LOW) and therefore should be fixed in future updates, but don't deserve their own security advisory.  Temporary file vulnerability in lvmcreate_initrd.  Patch attached.                    Affects: RHEL3   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=136308#c1)  Mark J.

RHBA-2004:232 - Bug Fix Advisory

Issued:
2004-09-01
Updated:
2004-09-01
# RHBA-2004:232 - Bug Fix Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Updated lvm package

## Type/Severity

Bug Fix Advisory

## Topic

An updated lvm package that includes a number of bug fixes and enhancements
is now available for the latest Red Hat Enterprise Linux Update 3 kernel
release.

## Description

LVM includes all of the support for handling read/write operations on
physical volumes, creating volume groups from one or more physical volumes
and creating one or more logical volumes in volume groups.

This updated version of lvm contains a number of enhancements, including
the ability to use EMC PowerPath pseudo-devices. In addition, a number of
minor bugs have been addressed.

All users of lvm should upgrade to this updated package, which resolves
these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade. Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated. Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated. Note that you
can also use wildcards (\*.rpm) if your current directory \*only\* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network. Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate. The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt>
