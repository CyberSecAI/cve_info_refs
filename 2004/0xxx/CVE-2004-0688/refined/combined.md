CESA-2004-003 - rev 2

<http://scary.beasts.org/security/CESA-2004-003.txt>

libXpm multiple image parsing flaws
===================================

Programs affected: libXpm, and any programs which use libXpm to decode XPM
files. For example, the GIMP seems to use libXpm.
Severity: Compromise of account used to browse malicious XPM file.
CAN identifier(s): CAN-2004-0782 and CAN-2004-0783
Fixed: X.ORG release 6.8.1 contains fixes.

This advisory lists code flaws discovered by inspection of the libXpm code.
The specific version of libXpm discussed is the release that comes with the
initial X.ORG X11 system source code release. However, these flaws seem to
exist in older versions.

Flaw 1. Stack-based overflow in xpmParseColors (parse.c).
This is CAN-2004-0782

Careless use of strcat() in both the XPMv1 and XPMv2/3 parsing code leads to
a stack based overflow that should be exploitable. There are minor
complications due to stack layout; the buffer being overflowed in fact
typically overflows into another buffer that is used to populate the overflowed
buffer. This should not prevent exploitation, however.
Demo XPM: <http://scary.beasts.org/misc/doom.xpm>

Flaw 2. Integer overflow allocating colorTable in xpmParseColors (parse.c) -
probably a crashable but not exploitable offence. Here:
This is CAN-2004-0783

    colorTable = (XpmColor *) XpmCalloc(ncolors, sizeof(XpmColor));

ncolors would seem to come from the (untrusted) XPM file.
In fact, multiple integer overflow problems seem to exist. Some may well be
exploitable. Note that the following may not be an exhaustive list:
a) XpmCreateImageFromXpmImage: multiple possible overflow, e.g.:
    image_pixels = (Pixel *) XpmMalloc(sizeof(Pixel) * image->ncolors);
(ncolors is user-supplied)
b) CreateXImage:
    *image_return = XCreateImage(display, visual, depth, format, 0, 0,
         width, height, bitmap_pad, 0);
(width and height are user-supplied, possibly other variables too)
c) ParsePixels:
    iptr2 = (unsigned int *) XpmMalloc(sizeof(unsigned int) * width * height);
(width and height are user-supplied)
d) ParseAndPutPixels and ParsePixels:
    cidx[char1][(unsigned char)colorTable[a].string[[1]](#1)] = a + 1;
(possibly, char1 might be negative, and access the cidx array out of bounds)

Flaw 3. Stack overflow reading pixel values in ParseAndPutPixels (create.c) as
well as ParsePixels (parse.c). Should be exploitable.
This is CAN-2004-0782

A user-supplied number of bytes are stuffed into a fixed-size buffer (typically
8192 bytes). The user gets to choose how many bytes to put into this buffer
via the "number of bytes per pixel" XPM value.
Demo XPM: <http://scary.beasts.org/misc/doom2.xpm>

# OpenMotif: Multiple vulnerabilities in libXpm — GLSA **200502-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libXpm, which is included
in OpenMotif, that can potentially lead to remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-libs/openmotif** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.2.3-r1**revision >= **2.1.30-r7** |

### Background

OpenMotif provides a free version of the Motif toolkit for open source
applications.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, out of bounds
memory access or directory traversals, have been discovered in libXpm
that is shipped as a part of the X Window System (see GLSA 200409-34
and 200411-28). OpenMotif, an application that includes this library,
suffers from the same issues.

### Impact

A carefully-crafted XPM file could crash applications making use of the
OpenMotif toolkit, potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenMotif users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose x11-libs/openmotif
```

Note: You should run 'revdep-rebuild' to ensure that all applications

CESA-2004-003 - rev 4
http://scary.beasts.org/security/CESA-2004-003.txt
[See all my vulnerabilities at http://scary.beasts.org/security]
libXpm multiple image parsing flaws
===================================
Programs affected: libXpm, and any programs which use libXpm to decode XPM
files. For example, the GIMP seems to use libXpm.
Severity: Compromise of account used to browse malicious XPM file.
CAN identifier(s): CAN-2004-0687 and CAN-2004-0688
Fixed: X.ORG release 6.8.1 contains fixes.
This advisory lists code flaws discovered by inspection of the libXpm code.
The specific version of libXpm discussed is the release that comes with the
initial X.ORG X11 system source code release. However, these flaws seem to
exist in older versions.
Flaw 1. Stack-based overflow in xpmParseColors (parse.c).
This is CAN-2004-0687
Careless use of strcat() in both the XPMv1 and XPMv2/3 parsing code leads to
a stack based overflow that should be exploitable. There are minor
complications due to stack layout; the buffer being overflowed in fact
typically overflows into another buffer that is used to populate the overflowed
buffer. This should not prevent exploitation, however.
Demo XPM: http://scary.beasts.org/misc/doom.xpm
Flaw 2. Integer overflow allocating colorTable in xpmParseColors (parse.c) -
probably a crashable but not exploitable offence. Here:
This is CAN-2004-0688
colorTable = (XpmColor \*) XpmCalloc(ncolors, sizeof(XpmColor));
ncolors would seem to come from the (untrusted) XPM file.
In fact, multiple integer overflow problems seem to exist. Some may well be
exploitable. Note that the following may not be an exhaustive list:
a) XpmCreateImageFromXpmImage: multiple possible overflow, e.g.:
image\_pixels = (Pixel \*) XpmMalloc(sizeof(Pixel) \* image->ncolors);
(ncolors is user-supplied)
b) CreateXImage:
\*image\_return = XCreateImage(display, visual, depth, format, 0, 0,
width, height, bitmap\_pad, 0);
(width and height are user-supplied, possibly other variables too)
c) ParsePixels:
iptr2 = (unsigned int \*) XpmMalloc(sizeof(unsigned int) \* width \* height);
(width and height are user-supplied)
d) ParseAndPutPixels and ParsePixels:
cidx[char1][(unsigned char)colorTable[a].string[1]] = a + 1;
(possibly, char1 might be negative, and access the cidx array out of bounds)
Flaw 3. Stack overflow reading pixel values in ParseAndPutPixels (create.c) as
well as ParsePixels (parse.c). Should be exploitable.
This is CAN-2004-0687
A user-supplied number of bytes are stuffed into a fixed-size buffer (typically
8192 bytes). The user gets to choose how many bytes to put into this buffer
via the "number of bytes per pixel" XPM value.
Demo XPM: http://scary.beasts.org/misc/doom2.xpm

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## libXpm library contains multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#537878

Original Release Date: 2004-09-30 | Last Revised: 2005-10-06

---

### Overview

libXpm contains multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities that may allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition or execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| XPM is a format for encoding and decoding X PixMap images that is used in the [X Windows System 11 (X11)](http://www.x.org). libXpm is a library of functions used to manipulate XPM images. Multiple libXpmroutines contain integer overflow vulnerabilities including, but not necessarily limited to, the following functions:     + xpmParseColors + XpmCreateImageFromXpmImage + CreateXImage + ParsePixels + ParseAndPutPixels + ParsePixels  These issues are the result of insufficient validation of user-supplied data. Consequently, an attacker may be able to exploit these vulnerabilities by supplying an application using libXpm with a specially crafted XPM image. Applications that receive input from remote sources may be remotely exploitable. Any program that uses the libXpm library may be affected by this issue. Users are encouraged to contact their vendors to determine if they are vulnerable. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Specific impacts depend on the application and libXpm routine being attacked. Potential consequences range from abrupt and abnormal program termination to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the compromised program. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a Patch for X11 Version 6.8.0**The X.org Foundation has released a patch to address this issue in version [6.8.0](http://www.x.org/pub/X11R6.8.0/patches/xorg-CAN-2004-0687-0688.patch). In addition, several vendors of relevant or derived implementations have released patches to address this vulnerability; please contact those vendors for further details. **Upgrade X11** This issue has been fixed in X11 version 6.8.1. |

# X.org, XFree86: Integer and stack overflows in libXpm — GLSA **200409-34**

libXpm, the X Pixmap library that is a part of the X Window System,
contains multiple stack and integer overflows that may allow a
carefully-crafted XPM file to crash applications linked against libXpm,
potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-base/xorg-x11** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.7.0-r2**= **6.8.0** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **6.7.0-r2**>= **6.8.0-r1** |

| Package | **x11-base/xfree** on the alpha x86 architecture |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.3.0-r7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.3.0-r7** |

| Package | **x11-base/xfree** on the amd64 hppa ia64 mips ppc sparc architecture |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.3.0-r7** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

XFree86 and X.org are both implementations of the X Window System.

### Description

Chris Evans has discovered multiple integer and stack overflow
vulnerabilities in the X Pixmap library, libXpm, which is a part of the
X Window System. These overflows can be exploited by the execution of a
malicious XPM file, which can crash applications that are dependent on
libXpm.

### Impact

A carefully-crafted XPM file could crash applications that are linked
against libXpm, potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All X.org users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=x11-base/xorg-x11-6.7.0-r2"
 # emerge ">=x11-base/xorg-x11-6.7.0-r2"
```

All XFree86 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=x11-base/xfree-4.3.0-r7"
 # emerge ">=x11-base/xfree-4.3.0-r7"
```

Note: Usage of XFree86 is deprecated on the AMD64, HPPA, IA64, MIPS,
PPC and SPARC architectures: XFree86 users on those architectures
