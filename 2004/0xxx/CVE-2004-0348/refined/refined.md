The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the Spider Sales shopping cart software.

**Vulnerability 1: Incorrect use of cryptography**

*   **Root cause:** The software uses a weak implementation of the RSA cryptosystem with a maximum modulus length of 20 bits, lacking a minimum length limit.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The short modulus makes it easily factorable, allowing an attacker to obtain the private key. The private key is stored in the same database and table as the public key.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to the database can decrypt any protected information.
*   **Attack vectors:** Access to the store's database is required.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to the database.

**Vulnerability 2: SQL Injection vulnerability**

*   **Root cause:** Several scripts in the software fail to filter the `userId` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** SQL injection vulnerability exists.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can modify SQL queries. This can lead to gaining access to the Spider Sales administrator interface, reading any information from the store's database (including private customer data) and executing arbitrary commands using `xp_cmdshell` function on MS SQL Server.
*  **Attack vectors:**  By manipulating the `userId` parameter in HTTP requests.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Summary of vulnerabilities:**
The software has two significant vulnerabilities: a weak cryptographic implementation that allows for easy decryption of sensitive information, and SQL injection vulnerabilities that can lead to complete compromise of the application and database.
