### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves several newly discovered publicly and privately reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own Vulnerability Details section.

If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

Microsoft recommends that customers install the update immediately.

**Does this update contain any other changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin, this update includes the following changes in functionality:

* As with the previous Internet Explorer Cumulative Security Updates that have been released since [MS03-004](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=12247), this update causes the window.showHelp( ) control to no longer work if you have not applied the HTML Help update. If you have installed the updated HTML Help control from Microsoft Knowledge Base article [811630](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;811630), you will still be able to use HTML Help functionality after you install this update.
* As with the previous Internet Explorer Cumulative Security Update, [MS04-004](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22189), this update prevents you from visiting Web sites that have "username:password@host.com" URLs for XMLHTTP. We have created an update to MSXML that addresses this issue specifically for XMLHTTP. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [832414](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=240797).

**Does this update contain any other security changes?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin, this update includes the following security changes.

* This update sets the [kill bit](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797) for the Hrtbeat.ocx ActiveX control. This control implements support for online gaming in MSN related sites. Internet Explorer no longer supports this control. This control has been found to contain a security vulnerability. To help protect customers who have this control installed, this update prevents the control from running or from being reintroduced onto usersÃ¢ÂÂ systems by setting the kill bit for the control. For more information about kill bits, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797).
* This update refines security verifications that are made when you open HTML Help files from the Internet by using the **showHelp** method. These changes prevent Web pages in the Internet zone from navigating to HTML Help files on the Local system.
* The update repairs the behavior of the Ã¢ÂÂDrag and Drop or copy and paste filesÃ¢ÂÂ security setting on Internet Explorer on Windows XP. If this setting was set to **Disable** or **Prompt** for a particular zone on Windows XP, it would not disable or prompt when dragging, dropping, copying or pasting files as documented on [Ã¢ÂÂSetting up Security ZonesÃ¢ÂÂ](https://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/techinfo/reskit/ierk/ch07_c.asp) Changes have been made to this setting to match the behavior as documented.
* This update increases the validation checking for image elements used in drag and drop events. If the element in a drag and drop event is not a valid image, this operation will be blocked. More information about this change is included in [Microsoft Knowledge Base article 887614](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=887614).
* This update increases the validation checking for function pointers. This increased validation occurs when an event handler points directly to a [Document Object Model (DOM)](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms533045.aspx) function. For more details, and ways to workaround this increased validation checking please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 887741](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=887741).
* As with the previous Internet Explorer Cumulative Security Updates that have been released since [MS04-004](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22189), this update also includes a change to the functionality of a clear-text authentication feature in Internet Explorer. The update removes support for handling user names and passwords in HTTP and HTTP with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or HTTPS URLs in Microsoft Internet Explorer. The following URL syntax is no longer supported in Internet Explorer or in Windows Explorer after you install this software update:

  http(s)://username:password@server/resource.ext

  For more information about this change, please see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [834489](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;834489).

**I am still using Windows XP, but extended security update support ended on September 30th, 2004. However, this bulletin has a securityÂ update for this operating system version. Why is that?**

The original version of Windows XP, commonly referred to as Windows XP Gold or Windows XP Release to Manufacturing (RTM) version, reached the end of its extended security update support life cycle on September 30th, 2004. However,Â the end-of-life occurred very recently. In this case, the majority of the steps that are required to address this vulnerability were completed before this date. Therefore, we have decided to release a security update for this operating system version as part of this security bulletin. We do not anticipate doing this for future vulnerabilities affecting this operating system version, but we reserve the right to produce updates and to make these updates available when necessary. It should be a priority for customers who have this operating system version to migrate to supported operating system versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Service Pack Product Life Cycle, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?pr=lifesupsps). For more information about the Windows Product Life Cycle, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

For more information, see the [Windows Operating System FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33330).

**Why are the command line installation switches different for the Internet Explorer 5.01 and Internet Explorer 6, and Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 packages on Windows 2000 and Windows XP operating systems for this release when compared to the last Internet Explorer Cumulative Security Update, MS04-025?**

These packages listed above are using a new installation technology, Update.exe. As a result the installation options are different than in previous releases. Also, as part of the change to the Update.exe installation technology the Knowledge Base Article number of this update will no longer be display in the Help, About window for Internet Explorer. For more information on the command line switches used for these release, please reference the Security Update Information section of this bulletin. More information on Update.exe is located on the following [Microsoft Web Site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/deployment/winupdte.mspx).

**Why are there two versions of the Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 update?**

A separate package has been created for Internet Explore 6 Service Pack 1 when used on Windows NT Server Service Pack 6a, Windows 98, Windows 98SE, and Windows Me. This update uses the same installer technology as previous releases, Iexpress. For details on installing this security update on those operating systems please see the Security Update Information sections of this bulletin. More information on Iexpress is located on the following [Web Site](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=197147).

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA will determine if this update is require. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**Note** After April 20, 2004, the Mssecure.xml file that is used by MBSA 1.1.1 and earlier versions is no longer being updated with new security bulletin data. Therefore, scans that are performed after that date with MBSA 1.1.1 or earlier will be incomplete. All users should upgrade to MBSA 1.2 because it provides more accurate security update detection and supports additional products. Users can download MBSA 1.2 from the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about MBSA support, visit the following [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer 1.2 Q&A; Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33332).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine if this update is required?**

SMS can successfully deploy this update for all versions of Internet Explorer, except for Internet Explorer 6 SP1. As noted in the Affected Components section of this bulletin, this release includes two packages for Internet Explorer 6 SP1. One package is designed for Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows XPSP1. This package uses the Update.exe installation technology discussed above. The second package is designed for Windows NT, Windows 98, and Windows Me. MBSA is not able to determine which Internet Explorer 6 SP1 update is required for a specific Operating System. A package intended for SMS Deployment only has been created that contains both versions of the Internet Explorer 6 SP1 updates. When deployed with SMS, this package will detect the operating system and install the correct version of the update for that operating system. MBSA when used with SMS, will instruct SMS administrators to deploy this SMS Deployment package. For more information on this update, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 887437.](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=887437)

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate any of these vulnerabilities?**

By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration that mitigates many Internet Explorer vulnerabilities. Since this Security Bulletin addresses multiple vulnerabilities, this mitigation is specified in the Mitigating Factors section of the respective vulnerability.

**What is Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?**

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or of an administrator downloading and running malicious Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying numerous security-related settings, including the settings on the **Security** and the **Advanced** tab in the **Internet Options** dialog box. Some of the important modifications include:

* Security level for the Internet zone is set to High. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), HTML content, and file downloads.
* Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.
* Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.
* Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.

## Vulnerability Details

#### CSS Heap Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0842:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer that could allow remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web Page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, significant user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for CSS Heap Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0842:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
* By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

  The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

  + Install the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-040](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-040) or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
  + Use Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 or later and have applied the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) or a later Cumulative Security Update for Outlook Express.
  + Use Microsoft Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 with the Microsoft Outlook E-mail Security Update installed

#### Workarounds for CSS Heap Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0842:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Set Internet and Local Intranet security zone settings to Ã¢ÂÂHighÃ¢ÂÂ to prompt before running ActiveX control and Active scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local Intranet zone.**

  You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active scripting. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and click **Custom Level.**
  4. Under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, click **Prompt**.
  5. Under **Active Scripting** in the **Scripting** section, click **Prompt**, and then click **OK**.
  6. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  7. Under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, click **Prompt**.
  8. Under **Active Scripting** in the **Scripting** section, , click **Prompt**.
  9. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes**to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the "Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites" workaround.
* **Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and active scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local Intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. Microsoft recommends that you only add sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" (without the quotes). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires the use of an ActiveX control to install the update.
* **Install the** **Outlook E-mail Security Update** **if you are using Outlook 2000 SP1 or earlier.**

  By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been applied.

  Customers who use any of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.
* **Install the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin** [**MS04-018**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) **if you are using Outlook Express 5.5 SP2.**

  Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail in the Restricted sites zone if the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been applied.

  Customers who use any of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.
* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or later, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or later, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or later and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about enabling this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [307594](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [291387](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### Similar Method Name Redirection Cross Domain Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0727:

A vulnerability in the cross domain security model exists in Internet Explorer because of the way that Internet Explorer handles navigation methods by functions that have similar names. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run malicious script code in the Local Machine security zone in Internet Explorer or access information in a different domain. In the worst case, if a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Similar Method Name Redirection Cross Domain Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0727:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
* Customers who have installed both the update referenced in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-024](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=30585) and have installed the ADODB.Stream update that is referenced in Knowledge Base Article [870669](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=870669) will be at a reduced risk of this vulnerability resulting in remote code execution.
* By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

A vulnerability in the cross domain security model exists in Internet Explorer because of the way that it handles navigation methods by functions that have similar names. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run malicious script code in the Local Machine security zone in Internet Explorer or access information in a different domain. In the worst case, if a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The process that the Internet Explorer cross-domain security model uses to validate navigation methods that have similar function names.

**What is the cross-domain security model that Internet Explorer uses?**

One of the principal security functions of a browser is to make sure that browser windows that are under the control of different Web sites cannot interfere with each other or access each other's data, while allowing windows from the same site to interact with each other. To differentiate between cooperative and uncooperative browser windows, the concept of a "domain" has been created. A domain is a security boundary - any open windows within the same domain can interact with each other, but windows from different domains cannot. The cross-domain security model is the part of the security architecture that keeps windows from different domains from interfering with each other.

The simplest example of a domain is associated with Web sites. If you visit <https://www.wingtiptoys.com>, and it opens a window to <https://www.wingtiptoys.com/security>, the two windows can interact with each other because both sites belong to the same domain, <https://www.wingtiptoys.com>. However, if you visited <https://www.wingtiptoys.com>, and it opened a window to a different Web site, the cross-domain security model would protect the two windows from each other. The concept goes even further. The file system on your local computer is also a domain. For example, <https://www.wingtiptoys.com> could open a window and show you a file on your hard disk. However, because your local file system is in a different domain from the Web site, the cross-domain security model should prevent the Web site from reading the file that is being displayed.

The Internet Explorer cross-domain security model can be configured by using the security zone settings in Internet Explorer.

**What are Internet Explorer security zones?**

Internet Explorer security zones are part of a system that divides online content into categories or zones that are based on the trustworthiness of the content. Specific Web domains can be assigned to a zone, depending on how much trust is placed in the content of each domain. The zone then restricts the capabilities of the Web content, based on the zone's policy. By default, most Internet domains are treated as part of the Internet zone. By default, the policy of the Internet zone prevents scripts and other active code from accessing resources on the local system.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run malicious script code in the Local Machine security zone in Internet Explorer. This could allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious Web page or an HTML e-mail message and then convincing the user to visit this page or to view the HTML e-mail message. When the user visited the page or viewed the e-mail message, the attacker could access information from other Web sites, access local files on the system, or cause script to run in the security context of the Local Machine security zone.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires a user to be logged on and to be reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as usersÃ¢ÂÂ workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to read e-mail or to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

#### Drag and Drop Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0839:

A[privilege elevation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer because of the way that Internet Explorer handles Drag and Drop events. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page that could potentially allow an attacker to save a file on the userÃ¢ÂÂs system if a user visited a malicious Web site or viewed a malicious e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for Drag and Drop Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0839:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. After they click the link, they would need to perform an action on the malicious web site that would invoke drag-and-drop handling in Internet Explorer.
* This vulnerability allows an attacker to place malicious code on the userÃ¢ÂÂs system in specified locations. An attack could only occur after the user ran this code, either by restarting the system, by logging off and then logging back on to the system, or by inadvertently running the code that the attacker saved locally on the system.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
* By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been applied. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail in the Restricted sites zone if the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been applied. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability.

  The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

  + Install the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-040](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-040) or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
  + Use Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 or later and have applied the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) or a later Cumulative Security Update for Outlook Express.
  + Use Microsoft Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 with the Microsoft Outlook E-mail Security Update applied.
  + Use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or later or Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or later in their default configuration.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for Drag and Drop Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0839:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Set Internet and Local Intranet security zone settings to Ã¢ÂÂHighÃ¢ÂÂ to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local Intranet zone.**

  You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active scripting. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level.**
  4. Under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, click **Prompt**.
  5. Under **Active Scripting** in the **Scripting** section, click **Prompt**, and then click **OK**.
  6. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  7. Under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, click **Prompt**.
  8. Under **Active Scripting** in the **Scripting** section, click **Prompt**.
  9. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements.

  Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes**to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the "Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites" workaround.
* **Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local Intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. If you do this, you can continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  4. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  5. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  6. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone
  7. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and to return to Internet Explorer.

  Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. You may want to add "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks) to your Trusted Sites zone. This site hosts the update. This site uses an ActiveX control to install the update.
* **Install the** **Outlook E-mail Security Update** **if you are using Outlook 2000 SP1 or earlier.**

  By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been applied.

#### Workarounds for Script in Image Tag File Download Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0841:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Set Internet and Local Intranet security zone settings to Ã¢ÂÂHighÃ¢ÂÂ to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local Intranet zone.**

  You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active scripting. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level.**
  4. Under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, click **Prompt**.
  5. Under **Active Scripting** in the **Scripting** section, click **Prompt**, and then click **OK**.
  6. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  7. Under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, click **Prompt**.
  8. Under **Active Scripting** in the **Scripting** section, click **Prompt**.
  9. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements.

  Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes**to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the "Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites" workaround.
* **Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local Intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. If you do this, you can continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  4. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  5. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  6. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone
  7. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and to return to Internet Explorer.

  Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. You may want to add "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks) to your Trusted Sites zone. This site hosts the update. This site uses an ActiveX control to install the update.
* **Install the** **Outlook E-mail Security Update** **if you are using Outlook 2000 SP1 or earlier.**

  By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been applied.

  Customers who use any of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.
* **Install the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin** [**MS04-018**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) **if you are using Outlook Express 5.5 SP2.**

  Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail in the Restricted sites zone if the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been applied.

  Customers who use any of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.
* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or later, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or later, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or later and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about enabling this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [307594](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [291387](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ for Script in Image Tag File Download Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0841:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [privilege elevation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability in Internet Explorer and could result in a file being saved on the user's system. The user would not receive a dialog box requesting to approve the download. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to host a malicious Web site that contained a Web page that contains a link that is designed to exploit this particular vulnerability and then persuade a user to visit that site. If the user took actions on that Web page, any code of the attacker's choice could be saved in a specific location on the user's system.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused by the way that Internet Explorer validates script in Image Tags.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could save code of their choice to the user's local file system. Although this code could not be run through this vulnerability directly, the operating system might open the file if it is saved to a sensitive location, or a user may activate the file inadvertently, causing the attacker's code to run.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires a user to be logged on and to be reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as usersÃ¢ÂÂ workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to read e-mail or to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?**

No. Although Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition do contain the affected component, the vulnerability is not critical. For more information about severity ratings, visit this [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

#### SSL Caching Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0845:

A spoofing vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer validates cached content from SSL protected Web sites. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to run script of their choice on security-enhanced Web sites.

#### Mitigating Factors for SSL Caching Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0845:

* An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* Before the user visits the legitimate SSL protected Web site, an attacker would have to redirect the userÃ¢ÂÂs navigation from the legitimate Web site to their malicious Web site that has the same host name. To do this, the attacker would have to intercept network traffic or point the userÃ¢ÂÂs system to a malicious DNS server.
* **The following products are not affected by this vulnerability.**
  + Internet Explorer 6 on Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2

#### Workarounds for SSL Caching Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0845:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Set advanced security settings to not saved encrypted pages to disk.**

  You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by changing your settings to not save encrypted contents to disk. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  3. Under **Settings**, scroll to **Security**.
  4. Under **Settings,** in the **Security** section, click **Do not save encrypted pages to disk.**
  5. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

#### FAQ for SSL Caching Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0845:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure and spoofing vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain access to information or spoof content on SSL protected Web sites.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Internet ExplorerÃ¢ÂÂs handling of cached SSL contents.

**What is SSL?**

[Secure Sockets Layer](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt) (SSL) is a protocol that allows web sessions to be encrypted for greater security. In Internet Explorer, when you visit a Web site and a yellow lock icon appears in the lower right corner of the browser window, the current session is protected by SSL.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could access information or spoof content on Web sites that are protected by SSL.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a Web site that has the same host name as a legitimate SSL protected Web site. If the attacker were then able to redirect navigation from the legitimate Web Site at that address to their malicious Web site, items of the attackerÃ¢ÂÂs choosing could be cached to the local system.

When the user visited the legitimate site in a second session, these items would be loaded in the context of the legitimate Web site. These items could include script code, images, or other locally cached content. This content could be crafted to obtain sensitive information that would typically be protected by SSL security.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires a user to be logged on and to be reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as usersÃ¢ÂÂ workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to read e-mail or to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?**

No. Although Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition do contain the affected component, the vulnerability is not critical. For more information about severity ratings, visit this [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer validates content during SSL sessions.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. We received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and to perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, see the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, see the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

## Microsoft Internet Explorer does not properly handle navigations from plug-ins

#### Vulnerability Note VU#625616

Original Release Date: 2004-10-13 | Last Revised: 2004-10-15

### Overview

Microsoft Internet Explorer contains a vulnerability in its handling of navigation commands from plug-ins. This could let an attacker spoof the address of a website.

### Description

| Microsoft Internet Explorer improperly handles navigations from plug-ins, such as ActiveX controls. This improper navigation handling could cause IE to display an incorrect URL in the Address bar. As a result, a web site operator could make it appear that the content from his or her web site actually originated from another site when, in fact, it did not. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability could be used to convince a user that the intruder's web site was actually a web site that the user trusts and might provide sensitive information to. |
| --- |

### Solution
