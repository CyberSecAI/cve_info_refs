- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of form input to the web frontends.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, allowing injection of malicious HTML code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious code can affect PKI staff or other users accessing the data, potentially leading to session hijacking or data manipulation on the OpenCA node. It can also affect offline components if data is transferred via removable media.
- **Attack vectors:**  Malicious HTML code injection through web form inputs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the web frontends of the OpenCA system.
