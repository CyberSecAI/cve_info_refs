## Microsoft IIS contains vulnerability in NNTP service

#### Vulnerability Note VU#203126

Original Release Date: 2004-10-21 | Last Revised: 2004-10-22

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the NNTP component of Microsoft IIS may allow a remote attacker to compromise the affected system.

### Description

| The Network News Transport Protocol (NNTP) is a protocol for the distribution, inquiry, retrieval, and posting of news articles over a network. Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS) provides support for a number of protocols, including NNTP. In addition to the original protocol specification in IETF [RFC977](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc977.txt), a number of standard extensions to NNTP are specified in [RFC2980](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2980.txt). One of these, the XPAT command, is used to retrieve specific headers from specific articles, based on pattern matching on the contents of the header. Several related flaws exist in the way the NNTP component handles the parsing and translation of user-supplied search patterns. These flaws result in a vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker with the ability to send a specially crafted message to the affected server. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute code of their choosing with administrative privileges on the affected system. |
| --- |

### Solution

Release Mode: COORDINATED RELEASE

*Vulnerability Description:*

 Microsoft IIS provides organizations using it with the ability to
 service and route news using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)
 with the Microsoft NNTP service listening on port 119/tcp, and
 optionally on port 563/tcp for SSL encrypted connections.

 Multiple vulnerabilities were found in Microsoft IIS that could allow
 an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable systems
 running the Microsoft IIS NNTP service.

 The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) is fully described in
 RFC 977 [[1]](#1):
 "NNTP specifies a protocol for the distribution, inquiry, retrieval,
 and posting of news articles using a reliable stream-based
 transmission of news among Not assignedthe ARPA-Internet community.
 NNTP is designed so that news articles are stored in a central database
 allowing a subscriber to select only those items he wishes to read.
 Indexing, cross-referencing, and expiration of aged messages are also
 provided".

*Vulnerable Packages:*

. Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a NNTP component
. Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Service Pack 3 NNTP component
  and Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Service Pack 4 NNTP component
. Microsoft Windows Server 2003 NNTP Component
. Microsoft Windows Server 2003 64-Bit Edition NNTP Component

*Solution/Vendor Information/Workaround:*

 A fix for the vulnerabilities reported in this advisory is available
 as a Microsoft Security update at:
 <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-036.mspx>

 A workaround is to disable the NNTP service. This will prevent attackers
 from exploiting the discovered vulnerabilities but will also make the
 NNTP services unavailable for legitimate users.

*Credits:*

 These vulnerabilities were found by Lucas Lavarello and Juliano Rizzo
 from Core Security Technologies.

*Technical Description - Exploit/Concept Code:*

 The Network News Transfer Protocol supports a number of different
 extensions. Extensions are described in RFC 2980 [[2]](#2).

 This advisory is focused on the XPAT command.
 "The XPAT command is used to retrieve specific headers from specific
 articles, based on pattern matching on the contents of the header".

 The syntax of the XPAT command is:
 XPAT header range|<message-id> pat [pat...]

 The XPAT command doesn't require previous user authentication and
 hence we believe this should be considered a high risk vulnerability.

 The vulnerabilities were found in the parser and query translator of
 the XPAT command  within the Network News Transfer Protocol service.

 The NNTP service translates calls to the XPAT command into an internal
 query format. As stated in its calling syntax, it accepts multiple
 patterns. Patterns as well as other parameters are delimited by tab
 and space characters.

 The vulnerabilities found reside in the methods that take care of
 parsing user-supplied ASCII values and append them translated to
 2-byte characters, as part of an internal query buffer.

 For better understanding, we have created example versions of the
 vulnerable methods that contain vulnerabilities.
 When compiled, these methods may not match  exactly their original
 versions, but are meant to be taken as illustrative examples.

 The NNTP service allocates a 4000 bytes buffer that it uses to store
 the translated XPAT query to a 2-byte character format. It keeps track
 of how many words are left in the buffer using a global counter
 initially set to the value of '2000'. A pointer to the buffer as well
 as a pointer to the counter are used in every call to the vulnerable
 string-appending methods which take care of updating those values for
 any future calls.

 The methods differ if called for user-supplied pattern data or internal
 query language keywords. In both cases, incorrect bounds checking is
 performed, leading to off-by-two, off-by-four and heap overflow
 vulnerabilities.

 The following example demonstrates the miscalculations made in the
 method used to append internal query language keywords to the global
 destination buffer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
// The wstringappendkeywords function.
//  input:
//    pdestbuf - a pointer to pointer to a wchar destination buffer
//    srcbuf - a pointer to a char source buffer
//    spaceleft - a pointer to an integer with the amount of bytes left
//
//  output:
//    pdestbuf - the pointer to pointer is updated to point after
//               the copied bytes
//    spaceleft - the integer is updated substracting the amount of
//                copied bytes.
//
//  returns:
//    1 on OK
//    0 on FAIL - if there isn't enough space in the destination buffer

int wstringappendkeyword (short **pdestbuf, char *srcbuf, unsigned int
*spaceleft)
{
unsigned int count = 0;
short *destbuf = *pdestbuf;

    if (srcbuf[count] != 0x00) {

        do {
            if (count > *spaceleft) {
                //...
                //not_enough_space handling code
                //...
                return 0;
            }

            destbuf[count] = (short)srcbuf[count];
            count++;

        } while(srcbuf[count] != 0x00);
    }

    *spaceleft -= count;
    *pdestbuf += count;

    return 1;
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 As seen above, the function is checking 'count' to be only bigger than
 the amount of words left in the destination buffer. In the case of
 count being equal to the value pointed by the 'spaceleft' variable,
 2 bytes would be written past the end of destbuf's buffer.

 In its last iteration, the loop will check 'count' to be bigger than the
 amount of words and fail, aborting the whole call to the command.

 By passing a specific amount of bytes in the 'srcbuf' buffer, an
 attacker could break free from the copyloop before the 'spaceleft'
 check is done; decrementing the 'spaceleft' variable. Subtracting one
 from zero causes an unsigned integer variable to wrap under to
 0xFFFFFFFF, bypassing the existing defective bounds check. This way,
 any further attempts to copy data into the internal query buffer using
 this function will lead into a controllable heap overflow.

 The only barrier for exploitation is that this function is only called
 for appending hardcoded query language keywords to the buffer. This is
 where the next vulnerable method takes place.

 The rest of the vulnerabilities reside in the method used for translating
 and appending user-supplied patterns. The situation is similar to
 the one shown above except that the 'srcbuf' pointer holds data that is
 100% controllable by an  attacker  and that it's called sequentially
 for each supplied pattern.

 You will also notice this procedure permits an attacker to overwrite
 4 bytes past the end of 'destbuf' buffer introducing an off-by-four
 vulnerability.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
// The wstringappendpatterns function.
//  input:
//    pdestbuf - a pointer to pointer to a wchar destination buffer
//    srcbuf - a pointer to a char source buffer
//    spaceleft - a pointer to an integer with the amount of bytes left
//
//  output:
//    pdestbuf - the pointer to pointer is updated to point after the
//               copied bytes
//    spaceleft - the integer is updated substracting the amount of
//                copied bytes.
//
//  returns:
//    1 on OK
//    0 on FAIL - if there isn't enough space in the destination buffer

int wstringappendpatterns (short **pdestbuf, char *srcbuf, unsigned int
*spaceleft)
{
unsigned int count = 0;
short *destbuf = *pdestbuf;

    while (srcbuf[count] != 0x00) {

        if (count > *spaceleft) {
            //...
            //not_enough_space handling code
            //...
            return 0;
        }

        if (srcbuf[count] == '[') {
            destbuf[count] = (short)'|';
            count++;
            destbuf[count] = (short)'[';

        } else {
            destbuf[count] = (short)srcbuf[count];
        }

        count++;
    }

    *spaceleft -= count;
    *pdestbuf += count;

    return 1;
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Once again, having decremented spaceleft 'count' times, an attacker
 could make the value of the global remaining-words counter wrap under
 to 0xFFFFFFFF or 0xFFFFFFFE. By crafting multiple patterns of a
 specific length, an attacker could cause a controllable Heap overflow.

 The following proof-of-concept code written in Python demostrates the
 problems.

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves a newly-discovered, privately reported vulnerability. A remote code execution vulnerability exists within the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) component of the affected operating systems. This vulnerability could potentially affect systems that do not use NNTP. This is because some programs that are listed in the affected software section require that the NNTP component be enabled before you can install them. The vulnerability is documented in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**I am still using Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Service Pack 6a or Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, but extended security update support ended on June 30, 2004. What should I do?**

Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Service Pack 6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 have reached the end of their life cycles as previously documented. Microsoft extended this support to June 30, 2004.

It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Life Cycle, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these operating system versions, visit the following [Microsoft Product Support Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33328).

Customers who require additional support for Windows NT Workstation 4.0 SP6a must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers who do not have an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329), select the country, and then click **Go** to see a list of phone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager.

For more information, see the [Windows Operating System FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33330).

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA will determine if this update is required. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

## Vulnerability Details

#### NNTP Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0574:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists within the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) component of the affected operating systems. This vulnerability could potentially affect systems that do not use NNTP. This is because some programs that are listed in the affected software section require that the NNTP component be enabled before you can install them. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious request that could potentially allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for NNTP Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0574:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. If the affected NNTP Ports (119 and 563) are blocked at the firewall, external attacks attempting to exploit this vulnerability could be blocked.
* Windows NT Server 4.0, Windows 2000 Server, and Windows Server 2003 are at a reduced risk from this vulnerability because the affected component is not installed by default. Even if Internet Information Services is installed, the affected component is not installed by default. An administrator must manually install the affected component for a system to become vulnerable to this issue.
* Exchange 2000 Server and Exchange Server 2003 require the installation of the affected operating system component. However upon installation, Exchange Server 2003 disables the affected operating system component. Exchange Server 2003 requires an administrator to manually re-enable this component to become vulnerable to this issue. Exchange 2000 Server does not disable this component by default when it is installed. However, if an administrator manually disables this component after installing Exchange Server 2000, the system is not vulnerable to this issue. Best practice recommendations for helping to secure Exchange 2000 Server include disabling the affected operating system component. For more information about how to help secure Exchange 2000 Server, visit the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/prodtech/exchangeserver/secmod43.mspx).

#### Workarounds for NNTP Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0574:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Block the following at the firewall:**

  + **UDP ports 119 and 563**
  + **TCP ports 119 and 563**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with a NNTP server. Blocking them at the firewall will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Also, make sure that you block any other specifically configured NNTP ports on the system. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about the ports that NNTP uses, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312). Port 563 is the default port that NNTP uses to perform Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connections.
* **Enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block the affected ports and to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [309798](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;309798).
* **Block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and how to apply filters is available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Articles [313190](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;313190) and [813878](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=813878).
* **Remove or disable NNTP if you do not need it:**

  In many organizations, NNTP only provides services for legacy systems. If you no longer need NNTP, you could remove it by following these steps. These steps apply only to Windows 2000 and later versions. For Windows NT 4.0, follow the procedure that is included in the product documentation. NNTP is a required component for Exchange 2000 Server and Exchange Server 2003. However, while NNTP may not be removed on Exchange servers, it can be disabled. NNTP is disabled by default on Exchange 2003. To help secure Exchange 2000 systems, follow the [Securing Exchange 2000 Server](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/prodtech/exchangeserver/secmod43.mspx) best practice recommendations instead of these instructions.

  To remove NNTP components and services:

  1. In Control Panel, click **Add or Remove Programs**.
  2. Click **Add/Remove Windows Components**.
  3. On the Windows Components Wizard page, under **Components**, click **Internet Information Services (IIS)**, and then click **Details**.
  4. Click to clear the **Network News Transfer Protocol Service (NNTP)** check box to remove NNTP.
  5. Complete the Windows Components Wizard by following the instructions on the screen.

  **Impact of Workaround:** NNTP services will no longer function. Any applications or services that require NNTP may fail. Administrators should not remove NNTP unless they fully understand the affect that doing so will have on their network. For more information about NNTP, see the [NNTP product documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windowsserv/2003/standard/proddocs/default.asp?url=/resources/documentation/windowsserv/2003/standard/proddocs/nntp_administration.asp?frame=true).

#### FAQ for NNTP Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0574:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges. This vulnerability could potentially affect systems that do not use NNTP. This is because some programs that are listed in the affected software section require that the NNTP component be enabled before you can install them.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) component.

**What is the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) component?**

The NNTP component provides a service that enables the distribution, retrieval, and posting of news articles among the Internet community. NNTP is designed so that news articles are stored in a central database allowing a subscriber to select only those items that they want to read. For more information about NNTP, see the [NNTP product documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windowsserv/2003/standard/proddocs/default.asp?url=/resources/documentation/windowsserv/2003/standard/proddocs/nntp_administration.asp?frame=true). NNTP is defined in Request for Comment (RFC) documents [977](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc977.txt) and [2980](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2980.txt).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted message and sending the message to an affected system, which could then cause the affected system to execute code.

An attacker could also access the affected component through another vector. For example, an attacker could log on to the system interactively or by using another program that passes parameters to the vulnerable component (locally or remotely).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Windows 2000 Professional (all versions), and Windows XP (all versions) are not affected by this vulnerability. The affected component is not supported on these operating system versions.

Windows NT Server 4.0, Windows 2000 Server, and Windows Server 2003 are at a reduced risk from this vulnerability because the affected component is not installed by default. Even if Internet Information Services (IIS) is installed, the affected component is not installed by default.

Exchange 2000 servers and systems that have manually enabled NNTP are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. Exchange 2000 Server and Exchange Server 2003 require the installation of the affected operating system component. However upon installation, Exchange Server 2003 disables the affected operating system component. Exchange Server 2003 requires an administrator to manually re-enable this component to become vulnerable to this issue. Exchange 2000 Server does not disable this component by default when it is installed. However, if an administrator manually disables this component after installing Exchange Server 2000, the system is not vulnerable to this issue. Best practice recommendations for helping to secure Exchange 2000 Server include disabling the affected operating system component. For more information about how to help secure Exchange 2000 Server, visit the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/prodtech/exchangeserver/secmod43.mspx).

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. This tool allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  **HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows NT 4 Option Pack\NOSP\883935**

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 883935 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and to perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, see the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, see the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
