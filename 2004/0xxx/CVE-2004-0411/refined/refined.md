{
  "CVE-2004-0411": {
    "Root cause": "The telnet, rlogin, ssh, and mailto URI handlers in KDE do not validate the hostname input, specifically the presence of a leading '-'.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Command injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this by crafting malicious URIs. \n\nSpecifically:\n\n*   **telnet/rlogin/ssh**:  An attacker can cause arbitrary file creation or truncation with the privileges of the victim.\n\n*   **mailto**: An attacker can start KMail with its display redirected to a remote machine under their control, enabling them to gain full access to the victim's files and account. Also an attacker can start KMail with an attacker-controlled configuration file, executing arbitrary commands with the privileges of the victim.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted telnet, rlogin, ssh, or mailto URI links"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to entice the user to click on the malicious URI. This can be done remotely (e.g., via a website or email)."
