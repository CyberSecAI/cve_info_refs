    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2004-0914",
      "Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Content": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow, out-of-bounds memory accesses, insecure path traversal and an endless loop in the libXpm library when decoding XPM (X PixMap) images.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
        "Integer overflow",
        "Out-of-bounds memory accesses",
        "Insecure path traversal",
        "Endless loop"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could create a specially crafted XPM file, which when opened by a user, could cause the application to crash, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
      "Attack vectors": "By tricking a user into loading a malicious XPM image with an application that uses a vulnerable version of the libXpm library.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious XPM file to a user who will open it with a vulnerable application."
