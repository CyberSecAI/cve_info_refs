      "description": "Several potential security vulnerabilities have been identified in the HP Tru64 UNIX TCP/IP including ICMP, and Initial Sequence Number generation (ISNs). These exploits could result in a remote Denial of Service (DoS) from network throughput reduction for TCP connections, the reset of TCP connections, or TCP spoofing.",
        "root_cause": "The industry standard TCP specification (RFC 793) has a vulnerability whereby ICMP packets can be used to perform a variety of attacks such as blind connection reset attacks and blind throughput-reduction attacks. Blind connection reset attacks can be triggered by an attacker sending forged ICMP \"Destination Unreachable, host unreachable\" packets or ICMP \"Destination Unreachable, port unreachable\" packets.  Blind throughput-reduction attacks can be caused by an attacker sending a forged ICMP type 4 (Source Quench) packet.",

      "cve_id": "CVE-2004-0790",
        "description": "The Internet Control Message Protocol is used to alert hosts on a network about certain situations, and the hosts then take automatic action to prevent network failures or to improve transport efficiency. The RFC recommends no security checking for in-bound ICMP messages, so long as a related connection exists, and may potentially allow several different Denials of Service.  A blind connection-reset attack is reported, which takes advantage of the specification that describes that on receiving a 'hard' ICMP error, the corresponding connection should be aborted. A remote attacker may terminate target TCP connections and deny service for legitimate users.",
