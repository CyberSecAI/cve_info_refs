# LHa: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200409-13**

Several buffer overflows and a shell metacharacter command execution
vulnerability have been found in LHa. These vulnerabilities can be used to
execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/lha** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | revision <= **114i-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **114i-r4** |

### Background

LHa is a console-based program for packing and unpacking LHarc archives.

### Description

The command line argument as well as the archive parsing code of LHa lack
sufficient bounds checking. Furthermore, a shell meta character command
execution vulnerability exists in LHa, since it does no proper filtering on
directory names.

### Impact

Using a specially crafted command line argument or archive, an attacker can
cause a buffer overflow and could possibly run arbitrary code. The shell
meta character command execution could lead to the execution of arbitrary
commands by an attacker using directories containing shell meta characters
in their names.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All LHa users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=app-arch/lha-114i-r4"
 # emerge ">=app-arch/lha-114i-r4"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Florian Schilhabel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-05-17 07:15:48 UTC  ``` hi all, another lha buffer overflow has been made public on [bugtraq] as the last, this one was also discovered by Ulf Harnhammar.  [quote from bugtraq] > it seems that lha is quite poorly written. after your last advisory, i > decided to take a look at the code and found 2 BO in function extract_one > (file lhext.c): >         if (extract_directory) >                 sprintf(name, "%s/%s", extract_directory, q); >         else >                 strcpy(name, q);  The first case (when the if clause evaluates to true) is a buffer overflow, but it only occurs when lha is called with long command line parameters:  lha xw=[about 390-400 characters] some_lharc_archive.lha  (It also works with other commands than x.)  Since q has a size of 256, and name has a size of 257, the second case is not really a problem.  [/quote] ---  here's the patch, btw:   --- lhext.c.old	2000-10-04 16:57:38.000000000 +0200 +++ lhext.c	2004-05-16 00:27:22.000000000 +0200 @@ -207,9 +207,11 @@  	}    	if (extract_directory) -		sprintf(name, "%s/%s", extract_directory, q); -	else -		strcpy(name, q); +		snprintf(name, sizeof(name), "%s/%s", extract_directory, q); +	else { +		strncpy(name, q, sizeof(name)); +		name[sizeof(name) - 1] = '\0'; +	}    -- so please apply, test and release a GLSA, if you want... ;-) florian      Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-05-18 06:16:27 UTC  ``` No, not again ? usata : please have a look at the patch and bump ebuild accordingly :) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Mamoru KOMACHI (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-05-19 10:12:00 UTC  ``` Hi, thanks for the patch. I couldn't find the post by Ulf Harnhammer (Only I found <http://msgs.securepoint.com/cgi-bin/get/bugtraq0405/126.html>, posted by Lukasz Wojtow) though.  Koon: I applied it and bumped lha revision.  btw, I originally wanted to rename lha-114i to lha-1.14i before these overflows  were revealed, as 1.14i is the right version and it seems original ebuild submitter  created the ebuild as lha-114i.ebuild only because the source archive was named  so.  There isn't any way in Portage to map one version to another at the moment, but I'm not too comfortable with the ebuild versioning of lha.  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-05-19 14:15:15 UTC  ``` Ready for a GLSA...  usata : if you change versions 114i -> 1.14i it will probably break upgrades (114>1.14). Maybe there is a way to handle this I don't know of. Probably better to leave it this way ? ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Mamoru KOMACHI (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-05-20 10:02:01 UTC  ``` Agreed. It was just a thought. I'm not going to do so since it breaks upgrades. It is not supported by Portage atm. If you remove or mask any other versions Portage will let you downgrade, say 114i-r2 to 1.14i-r3, but people don't know why they have to downgrade. I'll leave it as it is.  ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-05-23 04:59:15 UTC  ``` Rereading the bug description it requires a specific parameter call, so it's not really remotely exploitable.  I would say close without GLSA. Confirm anyone ? ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-05-24 02:15:02 UTC  ``` Got confirmation -- closing without GLSA ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Matthias Geerdsen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-02 06:39:32 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 62618](show_bug.cgi?id=62618 "RESOLVED FIXED - app-arch/lha: multiple vulnerabilities") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` |  |
