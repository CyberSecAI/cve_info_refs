Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerability 1: Incorrect use of cryptography**

*   **Root Cause:** The Spider Sales software implements the RSA cryptosystem with a modulus `n` of maximum 20 bits, lacking a minimum length limit. This makes it easy to factor `n` into `p` and `q`, thereby obtaining the private key `d`.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient key length in RSA implementation. Storage of both public and private key in the same database table.
*   **Impact:** An attacker gaining access to the store's database can easily decrypt all sensitive information that was encrypted using this weak RSA implementation.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker needs access to the database where the encrypted data and cryptographic keys are stored.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to access the database and knowledge of basic cryptanalysis.

**Vulnerability 2: SQL Injection vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize the `userId` parameter before using it in SQL queries.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization leading to SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL queries. This could allow them to gain access to the administrator interface, read any information from the database (including customer data) or execute arbitrary commands on the server by using `xp_cmdshell`.
*   **Attack Vector:** Inject malicious SQL code into the `userID` parameter of web requests.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests with crafted parameters to the affected web application. Basic SQL knowledge is required.
