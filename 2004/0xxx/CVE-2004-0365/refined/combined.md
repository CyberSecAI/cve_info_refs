How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Multiple remote overflows and vulnerabilities in Ethereal — GLSA **200403-07**

Mulitple overflows and vulnerabilities exist in Ethereal which may allow an
attacker to crash the program or run arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/ethereal** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.10.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.10.3** |

### Background

Quote from http://www.ethereal.com

"Ethereal is used by network professionals around the world for
troubleshooting, analysis, software and protocol development, and
education. It has all of the standard features you would expect in a
protocol analyzer, and several features not seen in any other product. Its
open source license allows talented experts in the networking community to
add enhancements. It runs on all popular computing platforms, including
Unix, Linux, and Windows."

### Description

There are multiple vulnerabilities in versions of Ethereal earlier than 0.10.3, including:

* Thirteen buffer overflows in the following protocol dissectors: NetFlow, IGAP, EIGRP, PGM, IrDA, BGP, ISUP, and TCAP.
* A zero-length Presentation protocol selector could make Ethereal crash.
* A vulnerability in the RADIUS packet dissector which may crash ethereal.
* A corrupt color filter file could cause a segmentation fault.

### Impact

These vulnerabilities may cause Ethereal to crash or may allow an attacker
to run arbitrary code on the user's computer.

### Workaround

While a workaround is not currently known for this issue, all users are
advised to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.

### Resolution

All users should upgrade to the current version of the affected package:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.10.3"
 # emerge ">=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.10.3"
```

OpenPKG Security Advisory                            The OpenPKG Project
<http://www.openpkg.org/security.html>              <http://www.openpkg.org>
openpkg-security@openpkg.org                         openpkg@openpkg.org
OpenPKG-SA-2004.015                                          16-Apr-2004
________________________________________________________________________

Package:             ethereal
Vulnerability:       arbitrary code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= ethereal-0.10.2-20040329 >= ethereal-0.10.3-20040330
OpenPKG 2.0          <= ethereal-0.10.0a-2.0.0   >= ethereal-0.10.0a-2.0.1
OpenPKG 1.3          <= ethereal-0.9.14-1.3.0    >= ethereal-0.9.14-1.3.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a vendor security advisory [[0]](#0) based on hints from Stefan
  Esser and Jonathan Heussser, several vulnerabilities of various types
  exist in the Ethereal network protocol analyzer [[1]](#1). Namely, it may be
  possible to make Ethereal crash or run arbitrary code by injecting a
  purposefully malformed packet onto the wire, by convincing someone to
  read a malformed packet trace file, or by creating a malformed color
  filter file.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the
  identifiers CAN-2004-0176 [[2]](#2) and CAN-2004-0365 [[3]](#3) to the problems
  concerning protocol dissectors and RADIUS packets.

  The zero-length presentation protocol selector vulnerability named in
  the Ethereal vendor advisory does not affect OpenPKG though, because
  such presentation protocol selectors are not implemented in any
  Ethereal versions released by OpenPKG.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
  -q ethereal". If you have the "ethereal" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution) [4][[5]](#5).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [6][[7]](#7), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [8][[9]](#9) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[10]](#10), build a corresponding binary
  RPM from it [[4]](#4) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [[5]](#5). For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.0, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.0/UPD
  ftp> get ethereal-0.10.0a-2.0.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig ethereal-0.10.0a-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild ethereal-0.10.0a-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/ethereal-0.10.0a-2.0.1.*.rpm

Hello,

during an audit I found a vulnerability in the radius dissector of
ethereal version 0.10.2
(and probably prior to aswell).
This bug allows a remote attacker to cause at least a denial of service
attack. The execution of
arbitrary code could be possible..

The problem is located in the function dissect_attribute_value_pairs of
packet-radius.c:

If you manage to create a packet which causes the find_radius_attr_info
call on line 2600 to return NULL,
and at the same time having avph.avp_length set to 2, then ethereal will
fail while
calling proto_tree_add_text on line 2608. More precisely while accessing
attr_info->str.

...
(2600)    attr_info = find_radius_attr_info(avph.avp_type, radius_attrib);
              if (avph.avp_length < 2) {
                   if (tree) {
(2608)            proto_tree_add_text(tree, tvb, offset, avph.avp_length,
                         "t:%s(%u) l:%u (length not >= 2)",
                         attr_info->str, avph.avp_type, avph.avp_length);
                   }
...

A possible fix for this would be to bail out when find_radius_attr_info
returns NULL, though this might
not be the best solution.

Thank you,
Jonathan Heusser
