Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-0215:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of robust verification of malformed email headers within Microsoft Outlook Express.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation of email headers, leading to a potential denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit would cause the Outlook Express program to crash.
- If the preview pane is enabled, the user would have to manually remove the malicious email and restart Outlook Express to regain functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted email message containing malformed headers to a vulnerable user's email account.
- The attack can be triggered by either opening the email or, if the preview pane is enabled, simply by the message being processed by Outlook Express.

- A workaround involves disabling the preview pane, which prevents the crash from occurring until the malicious email is opened.
- Microsoft released a patch (MS04-018) to address this issue.
- The vulnerability is identified as CAN-2004-0215.
- Microsoft had seen proof of concept code but no public exploitation when the security bulletin was issued.
