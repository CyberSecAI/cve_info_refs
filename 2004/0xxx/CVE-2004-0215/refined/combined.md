## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**What updates does this release replace?**

This is a cumulative update that includes the functionality of all the previously-released updates for Outlook Express 5.5 and Outlook Express 6. The security bulletin ID and operating systems that are affected for the previous Outlook Express update are listed in the following table.

| Bulletin ID | Outlook Express 5.5 SP2 | Outlook Express 6 | Outlook Express 6 SP1 | Outlook Express 6 (64 bit Edition) | Outlook Express 6 for Windows Server 2003 | Outlook Express 6 Windows Server 2003 (64-bit Edition) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **MS04-013** | Replaced | Replaced | Replaced | Replaced | Replaced | Replaced |

**Does this update contain any other changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the change that is listed in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin, this update includes the following changes in functionality:

* Sets Outlook Express 5.5 SP2 to view HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted Sites zone.
* Fixes a behavior that was introduced in MS03-014 where Outlook Express 6 SP1 and later creates a copy of the Windows Address Book in a predictable location with a file name of â~â. After you install this update, Outlook Express will no longer create this copy of the Windows Address Book in a predictable location.

**How does the extended support for Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition affect the release of security updates for these operating systems?**

Microsoft will only release security updates for critical security issues. Non-critical security issues are not offered during this support period. For more information about the Microsoft Support Lifecycle policies for these operating systems, visit the following [Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?pr=lifean1).

For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by any of the vulnerabilities that are addressed in this security bulletin?**

No. None of these vulnerabilities are critical in severity on Windows 98, on Windows 98 Second Edition, or on Windows Millennium Edition.

**I'm still using Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Service Pack 6a or Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, but extended security update support ended on June 30, 2004. However, this bulletin has a security update for these operating system versions. Why is that?**

Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Service Pack 6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 have reached the end of their life cycles as previously documented, and Microsoft extended this support to June 30, 2004. However, the end-of-life for the extended support period occurred very recently. In this case, the majority of the steps that are required to address this vulnerability were completed before June 30, 2004. Therefore, we have decided to release security updates for these operating system versions as part of this security bulletin. We do not anticipate doing this for future vulnerabilities affecting these operating system versions, but we reserve the right to produce updates and to make these updates available when necessary.

It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to future vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Life Cycle, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these operating system versions, visit the following [Microsoft Product Support Services Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;%5bln%5d;lifeanoct2003).

Customers who require additional support for Windows NT Workstation 4.0 SP6a must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/), select the country, and then click **Go** to see a list of phone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager.

For more information, see the [Windows Operating System FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;%5bln%5d;lifewinfaq).

**I just scanned my system by using the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and it did not tell me that I had to install this update. Am I at risk?**

MBSA does not currently scan for Outlook Express-related security updates. However, [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130) will successfully detect and install this update if it is required. For more information about MBSA and the products that MBSA currently scans, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsaqa.mspx).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine if this update is required?**

No. SMS uses MBSA for detection and this update is not detected by MBSA. However, the registry key information that is available in this bulletin can also be used to write specific file and registry key collection queries in SMS to detect vulnerable systems. For information about how to deploy updates not supported by MBSA with SMS, please review Knowledge Base article [867832](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;867832&) or visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).
