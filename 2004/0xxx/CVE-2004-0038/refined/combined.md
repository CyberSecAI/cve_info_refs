ABOUT THIS RELEASE
PURPOSE
This Patch replaces agent and server files in
ePolicy Orchestrator to resolve the issues
listed below.
RESOLVED ISSUES
1. ISSUE:
This release addresses the McAfee ePolicy
Orchestrator Remote Command Execution
Vulnerability; vulnerability identifier:
CVE-2004-0038.
RESOLUTION:
This vulnerability no longer exists.
ADDITIONAL RESOLVED ISSUES
1. This release addresses the McAfee ePolicy
Orchestrator HTTP POST Buffer Mismanagement
Vulnerability.
Vulnerability identifier: CVE-2004-0095.
2. ePolicy Orchestrator MSDE SA Account
Compromise -- The default installation of
MSDE, via ePolicy Orchestrator, configures a
connection between the ePolicy Orchestrator
server and MSDE to use an SA account. A
knowledgeable user could obtain the SA
password to this account. The ePolicy
Orchestrator server configuration file,
encrypted with 3DES, can be obtained by
issuing a carefully targeted HTTP request to
the ePolicy Orchestrator server. It is then
possible to decrypt this file and obtain the
password by reverse engineering the
product.
Vulnerability identifier: CAN-2003-0148
3. ePolicy Orchestrator 2.X Post Parameters
Heap Overflow -- Sending a POST request to
the ePolicy Orchestrator agent, where
parameters in the URL are substituted for a
large number of A's will cause the service
to stop responding. A carefully targeted
request will allow an attacker to overwrite
arbitrary data and thus execute code.
Vulnerability identifier: CAN-2003-0149
4. ePolicy Orchestrator 2.X Computerlist Format
String -- Sending a POST request to the
ePolicy Orchestrator server, where the
computerlist parameter contains a few format
characters, will cause the ePolicy
Orchestrator server service to stop
responding when it tries to log a failed
name resolution. A maliciously constructed
string containing format string characters
will allow the execution of arbitrary code.
Vulnerability identifier: CAN-2003-0616
5. ISSUE:
When trying to create the event file name of
NAIFFFF.EVT, the ePolicy Orchestrator agent
writes the file over and over, causing
VirusScan to use 100% CPU.
RESOLUTION:
The agent now properly writes the file.
6. ISSUE:
During the agent callback when the version
number is the same for the property files,
there was a ##delete## entered into the
incremental property file, causing the
properties to be removed from ePolicy
Orchestrator.
RESOLUTION:
The agent no longer enters ##delete## when
the properties are the same.
7. ISSUE:
When using the following strings in a
browser window, the agent displays a Dr.
Watson message:
http://:8081/%s%x%n
http://:8081/%x%s%n
http://:8081/%.516x
RESOLUTION:
The strings no longer cause the message to
appear.
8. ISSUE:
Even though the randomization setting was
enabled, a majority of the agents would
still synchronize when performing tasks.
RESOLUTION:
The agent now has a more varied
randomization period.
9. ISSUE:
Under certain circumstances, if the agent
tried to enforce policies and compile them
at the same time, policy corruption might
occur.
RESOLUTION:
The agent no longer enforces policies while
it is compiling.
10. ISSUE:
Under certain conditions, NAIMSERV.EXE tries
to release memory twice, causing an access
violation error that can cause the server to
crash.
RESOLUTION:
NAIMSERV.EXE no longer releases memory
twice.
11. ISSUE:
A single ADO connection was performing
multiple database operations at once,
causing a variety of issues, including
properties from agents to report
incorrectly, and the ePolicy Orchestrator
server to stop responding.
RESOLUTION:
Now a single connection performs only one
database operation at a time. This
eliminates the issues above and improves
overall performance.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
The agent wakeup call now includes a "Get
full Props" option, which requests complete
properties.
12. ISSUE:
If the public key data for the ePolicy
Orchestrator server was not entered into the
database the first time the agent sent it to
the server, the message "Invalid Server
Public Key...Package ignored from
" was saved in SERVER.LOG at
every agent-to-server-communication interval
(ASCI). When this situation occurred, the
server would no longer accept data from the
agent.
RESOLUTION:
The server now checks the size of the key
and, if it is empty, requests that the agent
resend it.
13. ISSUE
"Failed to enforce policies" and "Failed to
get properties" messages were incorrectly
reported in the "Server Event Viewer" and
the following events (alerts) were
incorrectly saved in the ePolicy
Orchestrator database even though policy and
task enforcement and properties collection
completed successfully.
2232 -- ePolicy Orchestrator Agent: Enforce
Policy Failed
2264 -- ePolicy Orchestrator Agent: Property
Collection Failed
2328 -- ePolicy Orchestrator Agent: Enforce
Task Failed
RESOLUTION:
These incorrect messages are no longer
reported in the "Server Event Viewer."
Although, the incorrect events are still
generated, you can now filter them so that
they are no longer collected.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
To filter these events, do the following:
1. Log on to the desired ePolicy
Orchestrator database server using "ePO
authentication" and a global
administrator account.
2. In the console tree under "ePO Reports,"
"ePO Databases," , click
"Alerts." The "Alerts" dialog box appears
in the details pane.
3. On the "Filtering" tab, deselect the
checkboxes that correspond to events
2232, 2264, and 2328.
4. Click "Apply." Beginning at the next
agent-to-server communication interval
(ASCI), these events will no longer be
collected. Events that are already in the
database are not affected.
14. ISSUE:
If an ePolicy Orchestrator server was using
two network cards and, thus, two IP
addresses (for example, using one network
card for a remote SQL Server database and
another for the managed network), the first
binding IP address was always used for
agent-to-server communication. If this IP
address wasn't associated with the network
card being used for the managed network,
agents were unable to communicate with the
server.
RESOLUTION:
Now, if a value is defined for
"ServerIPAddress=" in SERVER.INI, agents use
it to connect to the server. Otherwise, the
first binding IP address is used.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
To specify an IP address in SERVER.INI, do
the following:
1. In a text editor, open SERVER.INI. This
file is located in the DB folder in the
installation directory. The default
installation directory is:
C:\PROGRAM FILES\MCAFEE\EPO\2.0
2. Type the following line in SERVER.INI,
then save the file:
SERVERIPADDRESS=
3. In the "Service" dialog box, select the
"McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 2.5.1
Server" service, click "Stop," then click
"Start" to restart the service.
4. Deploy the agent or SITEINFO.INI to
affected client computers.
15. ISSUE:
If agents sent an empty event file to the
ePolicy Orchestrator server, server might
stop responding.
RESOLUTION:
The server now ignores empty event files and
logs a message in SERVER.LOG.
16. ISSUE:
A SELECT statement was used after events
were added to the database. This statement
slowed down server performance
unnecessarily.
RESOLUTION:
A SELECT statement is no longer used.
17. ISSUE:
The virus definition (DAT) file version
number for the Nimda Scanner (5000) was
being prefilled in the "Current Protection
Standards" dialog box and was causing DAT
files to be reported as out-of-date. This
dialog box appears when you run the
"DAT/Definition Deployment Summary," "DAT
Engine Coverage," or "Engine Deployment
Summary" reports.
RESOLUTION:
The DAT version number is no longer
prefilled in the "Current Protection
Standards" dialog box.

This release supports all language versions of
the ePolicy Orchestrator software.

INSTALLATION
INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
To use this release, you must have ePolicy
Orchestrator 2.5.1 software installed on the
ePolicy Orchestrator server that you intend to
update with this release.
NOTE:
This release does not work with earlier
versions of the ePolicy Orchestrator
software.
INSTALLATION STEPS
1. Create a temporary folder on the hard drive
of the ePolicy Orchestrator server.
2. Extract the EPO25114.ZIP file to the
temporary folder that you created in Step
1.
INSTALLING THE PATCH
WARNING
Close the Windows Services dialog box to
avoid installation issues.
1. Back up ePolicy Orchestrator databases.
If you are using Microsoft SQL Server as the
ePolicy Orchestrator database, see the SQL
Server product documentation.
If you are using Microsoft Data Engine
(MSDE) as the ePolicy Orchestrator database,
you can use the Database Backup Utility
(DBBAK.EXE) to back up ePolicy Orchestrator
MSDE databases on the database server. For
instructions, see "Backing up ePolicy
Orchestrator MSDE databases" in the ePolicy
Orchestrator 3.0 Product Guide.
2. Log on to the desired computer using a user
account with local administrator
permissions.
3. Close all ePolicy Orchestrator consoles.
4. On the taskbar, click the "Start" button,
then point to "Run." The "Run" dialog box
appears.
5. In "Open," type the path where the Setup
program (EPO25114.EXE) is located, then
click "OK." The "ePolicy Orchestrator 2.x
Patch 14 Setup" wizard appears.
6. Click "Next" to begin the installation.
7. Click "Finish" to complete the
installation.
8. In the "Services" dialog box, select the
"NAI ePolicy Orchestrator 2.5.1 Server"
service and edit the service to change the
account back to the original setting. For
example, if you specified a domain
administrator account during the initial
installation, you need to provide that
account information again. The account is
not automatically restored.
SECURING EPOLICY ORCHESTRATOR SQL SERVER
LOGINS
If you installed MSDE as part of the ePolicy
Orchestrator installation, you need to complete
these steps if you are using SQL
authentication.
1. In a text editor, open the EPOSQLSEC.SQL
file from the temporary folder you created
in Step 1 of "Installation Steps." It
contains these lines:
EXEC sp\_addlogin
'',
'',
''
EXEC sp\_grantdbaccess ''
EXEC sp\_addrolemember
'db\_owner',
''
2. Replace the  variable with a
user name for a new SQL Server user account
(login). This variable appears three times.
3. Replace the  variable with a
password for the new user account. This
variable appears once.
4. Replace the  variable with
the name of the ePolicy Orchestrator
database. The default database name is
EPO\_, where  is the name of
the ePolicy Orchestrator server. This
variable appears once.
For example, if the user name is EPODBO, the
password is T2M0912, and the database name
is ePO\_MANAGE, the resulting file would be:
EXEC sp\_addlogin
'EPODBO',
'T2M0912',
'ePO\_MANAGE'
EXEC sp\_grantdbaccess 'EPODBO'
EXEC sp\_addrolemember
'db\_owner',
'EPODBO'
5. Save the file.
6. At the command prompt, run the following
command:
NOTE
This command is case-sensitive.
OSQL -d -U -P
-iEPOSQLSEC.SQL
Where  is the name of the
ePolicy Orchestrator database. The default
database name is EPO\_, where
 is the name of the ePolicy
Orchestrator server.
And where  and
 are the user name and password of
an account with system administrator
permissions on the database.
And where  is the location of the
EPOSQLSEC.SQL file.
For example, if the ePolicy Orchestrator
database name is ePO\_MANAGE, the user name
is SA, the password is 53cr3t, and the
EPOSQLSEC.SQL file is in C:\TEMP, the
resulting command would be:
OSQL -dePO\_MANAGE -USA -P53cr3t -iC:\TEMP\EPOSQLSEC.SQL
7. Start the Server Configuration program
(CFGNAIMS.EXE). The default location is:
C:\PROGRAM FILES\MCAFEE\EPO\2.0
8. Click the "Administrator" tab.
9. Select "Use SQL authentication."
10. In "User name," type the value you
provided for the  variable
in Step 3.
11. In "Password," type the value you
provided for the  variable in Step
4.
12. Click "OK."
TESTING YOUR INSTALLATION
As agents communicate to the ePolicy
Orchestrator server, they are automatically
upgraded. If you wish to deploy the Patch
immediately, you must use an agent wakeup call
or deploy the new POAGINST.EXE file with a
software distribution tool. The new
POAGINST.EXE file created by the installation
process can be located in your ePolicy
Orchestrator installation directory. The
default location is:
C:\PROGRAM FILES\MCAFEE\EPO\2.0\DB\SOFTWARE\
EPOAGENT2000\2.5.1.298\0409\INSTALLFILES\POAGINST.EXE
REMOVING THIS RELEASE
To remove this Patch from your computer,
uninstall, then reinstall ePolicy
Orchestrator.
NOTE:
We recommend that you do NOT remove the
Patch files once you install them. If you
reinstall the ePolicy Orchestrator software,
we recommend that you also reinstall the
Patch.
