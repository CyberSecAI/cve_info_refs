# Samba: Remote printing non-vulnerability — GLSA **200409-14**

Samba has a bug with out of sequence print change notification requests,
but it cannot be used to perform a remote denial of service attack.

### Affected packages

### Background

Samba is a freely available SMB/CIFS implementation which allows
seamless interoperability of file and print services to other SMB/CIFS
clients.

### Description

Due to a bug in the printer\_notify\_info() function, authorized users
could potentially crash their smbd process by sending improperly
handled print change notification requests in an invalid order. Windows
XP SP2 clients can trigger this behavior by sending a
FindNextPrintChangeNotify() request before previously sending a
FindFirstPrintChangeNotify() request.

### Impact

We incorrectly thought that this bug could be exploited to deny service
to all Samba users. It is not the case, this bug has no security impact
whatsoever. Many thanks to Jerry Carter from the Samba team for
correcting our mistake.

### Workaround

There is no need for a workaround.

### Resolution

Samba users can keep their current versions.

# Samba FindNextPrintChangeNotify() Error Lets Remote Authenticated Users Crash smbd

---

*From*: "J�r�me" ATHIAS <jerome.athias () caramail com>

```

Date:  Mon, 30 Aug 2004 23:42:49 -0400
Subject:  <http://samba.org/samba/history/samba-2.2.11.html>

The Samba 2.2.11 release addresses the following bug:

  o Crashes in smbd triggered by a Windows XP SP2 client sending
    a FindNextPrintChangeNotify() request without previously
    issuing FindFirstPrintChangeNotify().

Impact:  Denial of service via network

Fix Available:  Yes   Exploit Included:  Yes   Vendor Confirmed:  Yes

Version(s): prior to 3.0.6, prior to 2.2.11

Description:  A vulnerability was reported in Samba. A remote authenticated user can cause smbd to crash.

The vendor reported that a remote authenticated user can send a FindNextPrintChangeNotify() request without having
previously sent a corresponding FindFirstPrintChangeNotify() requeste to cause smbd to crash.

This behavior can be triggered by a Windows XP SP2 client.

The flaw resides in printer_notify_info() in 'rpc_server/srv_spoolss_nt.c'.

Craig Huegen reported this flaw to the vendor.

Impact:  A remote authenticated user can cause smbd to crash.

Solution:  The vendor has released a fixed version (3.0.6 and 2.2.11), available at:

<http://samba.org/samba/download/>
