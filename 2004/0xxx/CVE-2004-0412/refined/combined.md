How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated mailman resolves security vulnerability
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1734
Issue date:        2004-07-19
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Bugfix
Cross references:  <https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1734>
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0412
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated mailman packages that fixes a remote security vulnerability are now
available.

2. Relevent releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Mailman is software to help manage email discussion lists, much like
Majordomo and Smartmail. Unlike most similar products, Mailman gives each
mailing list a webpage, and allows users to subscribe, unsubscribe, etc.
over the Web. Even the list manager can administer his or her list
entirely from the Web. Mailman also integrates most things people want to
do with mailing lists, including archiving, mail <-> news gateways, and so
on.

A flaw in Mailman 2.1.* allows a remote attacker to retrieve the mailman
password of any subscriber by sending a carefully crafted email request to
the mailman server.

A simple patch is available and is fixed upstream in Mailman 2.1.5.

All users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported fix and are not vulnerable to this issue.

Fedora Legacy would like to thank Marc Deslauriers for reporting this
issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit
<http://www> fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to configure yum
and apt-get.

5. Bug IDs fixed:

<http://bugzilla.fedora.us> - 1734 - CAN-2004-0412 Mailman password retrieval

6. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPM:
<http://download.fedoralegacy.org/redhat/7.3/updates/SRPMS/mailman-2.1.1-7.legacy.src.rpm>

i386:
<http://download.fedoralegacy.org/redhat/7.3/updates/i386/mailman-2.1.1-7.legacy.i386.rpm>

7. Verification:

SHA1 sum                                 Package Name
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from <http://www.fedoralegacy> org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>

# [Mailman-Announce] RELEASED Mailman 2.1.5

```
Today I am releasing Mailman 2.1.5, a bug fix release that also contains
new support for the Turkish language, and a few minor new features.
Mailman 2.1.5 is a significant upgrade which should improve disk i/o
performance, administrative overhead for discarding held spams, and the
behavior of bouncing member disables.  This version also contains a fix
for an exploit that could allow 3rd parties to retrieve member
passwords.  It is thus highly recommended that all existing sites
upgrade to the latest version.

The full source tarball, as well as a patch against Mailman 2.1.4 have
been made available.  See

	<http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103>

for links to downloads.

NOTE: You will want to read the UPGRADING file for important information
regarding upgrading from earlier version to Mailman 2.1.5.  A number of
internal file formats have changed so you must shut down web and mail
access to Mailman before you upgrade.  You will also want to re-run
configure (i.e. config.status) before you run "make install".

See also:

	<http://www.list.org>
	<http://mailman.sf.net>
	<http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman>

Finally, a personal note.  I have left Zope Corporation to join Secure
Software, a company started by John Viega -- Mailman's original author.
Although I won't be working on Mailman in any official capacity, it is
exciting to be working with him and the rest of the folks there.  I
leave Zope Corp on a positive note and wish nothing but success for them
too.

You can find Secure Software on the web at
<http://www.securesoftware.com.>  Please continue to use my
[barry at python.org](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-announce) email address for all Mailman correspondences.  I don't
expect much to change for the Mailman project at all.

Enjoy,
-Barry

2.1.5 (15-May-2004)

    - The admindb page has a checkbox that allows you to discard all held
      messages that are marked Defer.  On heavy lists with lots of spam holds,
      this makes clearing them much faster.

    - The qrunner system has changed to use only one file per message.
      However the configuration variable METADATA_FORMAT has been removed, and
      support for SAVE_MSGS_AS_PICKLES has been changed.  The latter no longer
      writes messages as plain text.  Instead, they are stored as pickles of
      plain strings, using the text pickle format.  This still makes them
      non-binary files readable and editable by humans.

      bin/dumpdb also works differently.  It will print out the entire pickle
      file (with more verbosity) and if used with 'python -i', it binds msg to
      a list of all objects found in the pickle file.

      Removed from Defaults.py: PENDINGDB_LOCK_TIMEOUT,
      PENDINGDB_LOCK_ATTEMPTS, METAFMT_MARSHAL, METAFMT_BSDDB_NATIVE,
      METAFMT_ASCII, METADATA_FORMAT

    - The bounce processor has been redesigned so that now when an address's
      bounce score reaches the threshold, that address will be sent a probe
      message.  Only if the probe bounces will the address be disabled.  The
      score is reset to zero when the probe is sent.  Also, bounce events are
      now kept in an event file instead of in memory.  This should help
      contain the bloat of the BounceRunner.

      New supporting variables in Defaults.py: VERP_PROBE_FORMAT,
      VERP_PROBE_REGEXP

      REGISTER_BOUNCES_EVERY is promoted to a Defaults.py variable.

    - The pending database has been changed from a global pickle file, to a
      unique pickle file per mailing list.

    - The 'request' database file has changed from a marshal, to the more
      secure pickle format.

    - Disallow multiple password retrievals.

    - The email package is updated to version 2.5.5.

    - New language: Turkish.

    - Bugs and patches: 869644, 869647 (NotAMemberError for old cookie data),
      878087 (bug in Slovenian catalog), 899263 (ignore duplicate pending
      ids), 810675 (discard all defers button)

```
