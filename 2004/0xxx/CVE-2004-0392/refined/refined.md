- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An incorrectly constructed Generic Payload Header in an IKE message.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of malformed IKE Generic Payload Headers
- **Impact of exploitation**: The racoon daemon goes into a tight loop and drops connections, causing a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted IKE message with an incorrectly constructed Generic Payload Header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must be able to send IKE messages to a vulnerable racoon instance.
