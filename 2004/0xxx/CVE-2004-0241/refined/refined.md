Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in X-Cart 3.4.3:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Arbitrary File Viewing:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application allows user-controlled input to specify file paths, without proper sanitization, leading to directory traversal.
    *   **Weakness:** Path traversal vulnerability
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can view arbitrary files on the web server. This could include sensitive configuration files, source code, or other confidential data.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafted URL with directory traversal characters in the `shop_closed_file` parameter:
        ```
        <http://servername/customer/auth.php?config>[General][shop_closed]=Y&shop_closed_file=../../../../../../../etc/passwd
        ```
    *   **Required Capabilities:** None, any visitor can exploit this.

2.  **Arbitrary Command Execution:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application allows user-controlled input to specify commands, without proper sanitization, leading to arbitrary command execution by the webserver user.
    *   **Weakness:** Command injection vulnerability
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user. This can lead to complete compromise of the system.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted URLs with command injection in the `perl_binary` and other parameters:
        ```
        <http://server/admin/upgrade.php?prepatch_errorcode=1&patch_files>[[0]](#0)[orig_file]=VERSION&perl_binary=/bin/rm -rf &patch_exe=..
        <http://server/admin/general.php?mode=perlinfo&config>[General][perl_binary]=/bin/ls -lR ||
        ```
    *  **Required Capabilities:** None, any visitor can exploit this.

3.  **Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application exposes PHP and Perl configuration information through dedicated pages without authentication.
    *   **Weakness:** Information Leakage
    *  **Impact:** An attacker can gain sensitive information about the server's configuration, including paths, extensions, and other details which can facilitate other attacks
    *  **Attack Vectors:** Accessing the following URLs:
        ```
        <http://server/admin/general.php?mode=phpinfo>
        <http://server/admin/general.php?mode=perlinfo>
        ```
    *  **Required Capabilities:** None, any visitor can exploit this.
