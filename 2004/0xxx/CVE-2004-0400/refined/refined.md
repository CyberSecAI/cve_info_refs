Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1 (bug1):**

*   **Root Cause:** Stack-based buffer overflow in `verify.c` due to the use of `sprintf` without proper bounds checking.
*   **Weakness:** The `sprintf` function is used to format a string into a stack-allocated buffer using the sender address and host information. If the combined length of the sender address and host information exceeds the buffer's size, a buffer overflow occurs.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution is possible.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted email with an excessively long sender address.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the vulnerable exim server. `sender_verify = true` must be set in the `exim.conf`.

**Vulnerability 2 (bug2):**

*   **Root Cause:** Stack-based buffer overflow in `accept.c` (for exim 3.35) and `verify.c` (for exim 4.32) due to unbounded copying of data into a fixed-size buffer.
*   **Weakness:** The code iterates through a string (`t`) copying characters to a fixed-size buffer (`hname`) without proper bounds checking. If the length of the string segment before the colon is larger than the size of the buffer, it leads to a stack buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:**  Likely arbitrary code execution, although the advisory mentions the exploitability is not as clear as in bug1.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted email header (e.g., "From:") with an excessively long string before the colon.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the vulnerable exim server. `headers_check_syntax` must be set in `exim.conf` for version 3.35 and `require verify = header_syntax` must be set for version 4.32.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Exim 3.35 is vulnerable to both `bug1` and `bug2`.
*   Exim 4.32 is vulnerable to `bug2`.

**Fix:**

The advisory provides unofficial fixes by replacing `sprintf` with `snprintf` and adding bounds checking to the string copy loop.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory notes that both vulnerabilities require specific non-default options to be enabled in the Exim configuration file.
*   Exploit scripts (`exi1.pl`, `exi2.pl`, `exi3.pl`) are provided to test the vulnerabilities.
