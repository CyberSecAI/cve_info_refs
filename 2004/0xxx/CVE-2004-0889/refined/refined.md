Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-0889:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Multiple integer overflows and arithmetic errors were found in the xpdf library. These flaws are triggered during the processing of PDF files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow vulnerabilities within the xpdf library, specifically in how it handles certain data in PDF files.
- Arithmetic errors that can also lead to exploitable conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote code execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application using the vulnerable xpdf code.
- **Application crash:** Exploiting these flaws can lead to the crash of the PDF viewing application.
- **CUPS spooler compromise:** When printing a malicious PDF using CUPS (which uses xpdf code), an attacker could crash the CUPS spooler or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the CUPS spooler user (typically "lp").

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF file:** The primary attack vector involves enticing a user to open a specially crafted PDF file.
- **Printing malformed PDFs:** When using CUPS, printing a specially crafted PDF file can trigger the vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted PDF file to the user, which can be achieved via various means (email, website downloads, etc).
- For CUPS exploitation, the attacker needs to get a user to print the crafted PDF using a vulnerable CUPS instance.

**Additional details from the provided content**
- Multiple applications are affected, including xpdf itself, gpdf, kpdf, koffice and cups.
- The vulnerability affects various SUSE distributions (8.1, 8.2, 9.0, 9.1, 9.2, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 8, 9, SUSE Linux Desktop 1.0).
- Gentoo Linux was also affected.
- Patches are available for the affected applications/libraries, and it is recommended to apply them.
- Specific package versions affected for Gentoo are detailed in the provided documents.
