Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-0636:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the way some versions of the AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) client handle AIM "Away" messages. Specifically, the `goaway` function of the `aim:` URI handler is vulnerable to overly long input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer overflow in the `goaway` function of the `aim:` URI handler. This is caused by insufficient input validation or lack of bounds checking when processing AIM "Away" messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. The attacker-supplied code runs with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable AIM client.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a malicious URL supplied in an instant message or embedded in a web page. The AIM user needs to click on this malicious URL to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send AIM messages or embed a malicious URL in a web page that an AIM user will click on. The attacker needs no prior authentication or privileged access.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted `aim:` URI.
- The vendor, AOL Time Warner, was initially unaware of a solution, but later provided a workaround by removing a registry key.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed by Secunia and iDefense, with credits to multiple researchers.
- The workaround is specific to Windows users.
- The vulnerability has a severity metric of 14.38.
