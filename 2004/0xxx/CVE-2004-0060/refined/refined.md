The content provided details multiple vulnerabilities in WWW File Share Pro <= 2.42.

**A] Arbitrary server's files overwriting**
*   **Root cause:**  The application fails to properly sanitize the filename provided during file upload operations.
*   **Weakness:** Path traversal vulnerability. The application does not validate the filename, allowing the user to use dot-dot sequences ("../") in the filename to navigate outside the intended upload directory.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the server's file system.
*   **Attack vector:** By sending a crafted HTTP POST request with a modified "filename" parameter containing path traversal sequences.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the server, which means remote access is required.

**B] Remote crash**
*   **Root cause:** The application does not handle large POST requests correctly.
*  **Weakness:** Lack of proper input validation and resource management for incoming POST data.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition by either exhausting the server's CPU resources or crashing the application entirely. This can lead to system freezes in severe cases.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a large number of bytes via a POST request.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the server, which means remote access is required.

**C] Directory authorization bypass**
*   **Root cause:** The application fails to properly handle URI normalization and directory traversal sequences at the end and beginning of the url.
*  **Weakness:** Incorrect input sanitization and validation of URLs requested.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can bypass the directory access controls and gain unauthorized access to protected directories on the server.
*   **Attack vector:** Modifying the requested URL by adding a dot, slash, or backslash character at the end or beginning of a directory path, respectively.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the server, which means remote access is required.
