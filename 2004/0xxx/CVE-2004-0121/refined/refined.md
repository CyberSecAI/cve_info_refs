Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-0121:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Outlook 2002 processes `mailto:` URLs. Specifically, Outlook fails to properly sanitize or escape quote symbols within the URL. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary command-line arguments into the `OUTLOOK.EXE` process when a `mailto:` URL is opened.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is the ability to inject command-line arguments into the Outlook executable due to the lack of proper handling of quote characters in `mailto:` URLs.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Outlook 2002 does not adequately sanitize or escape special characters within the `mailto:` URL, specifically quote characters, before passing it as a command-line argument.
- **Improper URL Handling:** Outlook's `mailto:` URL handler does not properly validate the input, leading to the command injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting a `javascript:` URL as a command-line argument and if "Outlook Today" is the current view, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the "Local Machine" zone. This enables the attacker to download and execute any executable file.
- **File Access:** Successful exploitation could grant an attacker access to files on the user's system, as the code executes within the user's security context.
- **Privilege Escalation:** While the code executes in the user's security context, if the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain a higher level of control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Pages:** An attacker can host a malicious web page with an IMG tag that refers to a specially crafted `mailto:` URL. When a user visits this page, Outlook would be launched with the injected command line arguments.
- **HTML Email:** An attacker can embed the malicious `mailto:` URL in an HTML email message. When the user views the email, Outlook is triggered with the crafted URL.
- **Double mailto: URL Attack:** An attacker can use two `mailto:` URLs, the first to force Outlook to open the "Outlook Today" view and the second to inject and execute malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious `mailto:` URL that contains injected command-line arguments.
- The attacker needs to deliver the crafted URL to the victim via a malicious web page or HTML email.
- The user needs to either view the malicious web page or email for the attack to be successful.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is not a standard cross-site scripting (XSS) issue but a command injection vulnerability related to URL handling.
-  Microsoft initially stated that the vulnerability only affected users with the "Outlook Today" homepage, this was later found to be inaccurate, requiring a revised severity rating.
-  The vulnerability can be exploited even if the "Outlook Today" view is not the default, by using a two-step approach with multiple `mailto:` URLs.
-   A patch (MS04-009) was released to correct the vulnerability.
-  Workarounds, such as disabling the "Outlook Today" page and reading emails in plain text, can reduce the risk.
