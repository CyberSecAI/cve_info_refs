The provided content is related to CVE-2004-0892.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0 and ISA Server 2000 cache reverse DNS lookup results. The software caches the hostname received during a reverse lookup and uses that result for subsequent forward lookups, without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper caching of reverse DNS lookup results.
- Lack of validation of hostname received during reverse lookups.
- Trusting the hostname received during reverse lookups as valid.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can spoof trusted Internet content.
- Users may be redirected to malicious websites or other malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to persuade a user to visit a site controlled by the attacker.
- The attacker's site would initiate a reverse lookup.
- The attacker would provide a spoofed reverse lookup response containing a malicious domain name.
- The affected software would cache the spoofed domain name.
- When the user tries to access the legitimate resource using the spoofed domain name, the request will be routed to the attackerâ€™s server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to host a web site or deliver web content that would cause a reverse DNS lookup to occur.
- The attacker must control the reverse lookup response.
- The attacker needs to persuade a user to visit their site.
