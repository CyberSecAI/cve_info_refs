## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

# Fedora alert FEDORA-2004-186 (kernel)

| Subject: |  | [SECURITY] Fedora Core 1 Update: kernel-2.4.22-1.2194.nptl |
| Date: |  | Wed, 23 Jun 2004 19:25:44 +0100 |

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fedora Security Update Notification
FEDORA-2004-186
2004-06-23
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Product     : Fedora Core 1
Name        : kernel
Version     : 2.4.22
Release     : 1.2194.nptl
Summary     : The Linux kernel (the core of the Linux operating system)
Description :
The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of your
Fedora Core Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the basic functions
of the operating system:  memory allocation, process allocation, device
input and output, etc.

Numerous problems referencing userspace memory were identified in several
device drivers by Al Viro using the sparse tool.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the name CAN-2004-0495 to this issue.

A problem was found where userspace code could execute certain floating
point instructions from signal handlers which would cause the kernel
to lock up.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
assigned the name CAN-2004-0554 to this issue.

Previous kernels contained a patch against the framebuffer ioctl
code which turned out to be unnecessary. This has been dropped
in this update.

A memory leak in the E1000 network card driver has been fixed.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned
the name CAN-2004-0535 to this issue.

Previously, inappropriate permissions were set on /proc/scsi/qla2300/HbaApiNode
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned
the name CAN-2004-0587 to this issue.

Support for systems with more than 4GB of memory was previously unavailable.
The 686 SMP kernel now supports this configuration. (Bugzilla #122960)
Support for SMP on 586's was also previously not included.
This has also been rectified. (Bugzilla #111871)

### Background

The Linux kernel is responsible for managing the core aspects of a
GNU/Linux system, providing an interface for core system applications
as well as providing the essential structure and capability to access
hardware that is needed for a running system.

### Description

Multiple flaws have been discovered in the Linux kernel. This advisory
corrects the following issues:

* CAN-2004-0109: This vulnerability allows privilege escalation using
  ISO9660 file systems through a buffer overflow via a malformed file
  system containing a long symbolic link entry. This can allow arbitrary
  code execution at kernel level.
* CAN-2004-0133: The XFS file system in 2.4 series kernels has an
  information leak by which data in the memory can be written to the
  device hosting the file system, allowing users to obtain portions of
  kernel memory by reading the raw block device.
* CAN-2004-0177: The ext3 file system in 2.4 series kernels does not
  properly initialize journal descriptor blocks, causing an information
  leak by which data in the memory can be written to the device hosting
  the file system, allowing users to obtain portions of kernel memory by
  reading the raw device.
* CAN-2004-0181: The JFS file system in 2.4 series kernels has an
  information leak by which data in the memory can be written to the
  device hosting the file system, allowing users to obtain portions of
  kernel memory by reading the raw device.
* CAN-2004-0178: The OSS Sound Blaster [R] Driver has a Denial of Service
  vulnerability since it does not handle certain sample sizes properly.
  This allows local users to hang the kernel.
* CAN-2004-0228: Due to an integer signedness error in the CPUFreq /proc
  handler code in 2.6 series Linux kernels, local users can escalate
  their privileges.
* CAN-2004-0229: The framebuffer driver in 2.6 series kernel drivers does
  not use the fb\_copy\_cmap method of copying structures. The impact of
  this issue is unknown, however.
* CAN-2004-0394: A buffer overflow in the panic() function of 2.4 series
  Linux kernels exists, but it may not be exploitable under normal
  circumstances due to its functionality.
* CAN-2004-0427: The do\_fork() function in both 2.4 and 2.6 series Linux
  kernels does not properly decrement the mm\_count counter when an error
  occurs, triggering a memory leak that allows local users to cause a
  Denial of Service by exhausting other applications of memory; causing
  the kernel to panic or to kill services.
* CAN-2004-0495: Multiple vulnerabilities found by the Sparse source
  checker in the kernel allow local users to escalate their privileges or
  gain access to kernel memory.
* CAN-2004-0535: The e1000 NIC driver does not properly initialize memory
  structures before using them, allowing users to read kernel memory.
* CAN-2004-0554: 2.4 and 2.6 series kernels running on an x86 or an AMD64
  architecture allow local users to cause a Denial of Service by a total
  system hang, due to an infinite loop that triggers a signal handler
  with a certain sequence of fsave and frstor instructions.
* Local DoS in PaX: If ASLR is enabled as a GRSecurity PaX feature, a
  Denial of Service can be achieved by putting the kernel into an
  infinite loop. Only 2.6 series GRSecurity kernels are affected by this
  issue.
* RSBAC 1.2.3 JAIL issues: A flaw in the RSBAC JAIL implementation allows
  suid/sgid files to be created inside the jail since the relevant module
  does not check the corresponding mode values. This can allow privilege
  escalation inside the jail. Only rsbac-(dev-)sources are affected by
  this issue.

### Impact

Arbitrary code with normal non-super-user privileges may be able to
exploit any of these vulnerabilities; gaining kernel level access to
memory structures and hardware devices. This may be used for further
exploitation of the system, to leak sensitive data or to cause a Denial
of Service on the affected kernel.

### Workaround

Although users may not be affected by certain vulnerabilities, all
kernels are affected by the CAN-2004-0394, CAN-2004-0427 and
CAN-2004-0554 issues which have no workaround. As a result, all users
are urged to upgrade their kernels to patched versions.

### Resolution

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest available sources for
their system:

```
 # emerge sync
 # emerge -pv your-favorite-sources
 # emerge your-favorite-sources

 # # Follow usual procedure for compiling and installing a kernel.
 # # If you use genkernel, run genkernel as you would do normally.
```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=125168#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2004-06-03 12:28:04 UTC  ``` According to <http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/testing/patch-2.4.27.log> a recent kernel fix was applied "e1000: fix probable security hole".  This issue in fact is a minor information leak via the e1000 driver that can reveal 24 bytes of kernel memory to users (if e1000 driver is loaded)  Note that a number of security databases have incorrect information regarding this issue.  Originally, ISS said this was a privilege escalation vulnerability: <http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/16159>  They have since updated this page to explain that it is an information leak, but there are still remnants of the old content viewable (the page still erroneously lists the vulnerability as "high priority" and with "gain privileges" consequences)  No CVE name yet available   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=125168#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2004-06-03 12:30:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 100821](attachment.cgi?id=100821&action=diff "Patch for e1000 kernel mem leak") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=100821&action=edit "Patch for e1000 kernel mem leak") Patch for e1000 kernel mem leak   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=125168#c2)  Mark J. Cox    2004-06-04 08:00:46 UTC  ``` [CAN-2004-0535](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-0535)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=125168#c3)  Ernie Petrides    2004-06-15 10:03:53 UTC  ``` A fix for this problem has just been committed to the RHEL3 U3 patch pool this evening (in kernel version 2.4.21-15.11.EL) with the upgrade of the e1000 driver to version 5.2.52-k1 (which doesn't contain the mem leak addressed by [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=125168#c1)).    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=125168#c4)  Ernie Petrides    2004-07-31 06:00:08 UTC  ``` A fix for this problem has also been committed to the RHEL3 E3 patch pool (in kernel version 2.4.21-15.0.4.EL).    ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=125168#c5)  Mark J. Cox    2004-08-03 22:36:26 UTC  ```  An errata has been issued which should help the problem  described in this bug report. This report is therefore being  closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files,  please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report  if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2004-413.html>    ``` |  |
