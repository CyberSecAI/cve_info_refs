- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The server does not filter input strings before displaying them in the returned page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the server's response, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code in a user's browser when they visit the affected page.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the request, an attacker can inject the code into the server's response.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. The specific vulnerability is triggered when the malicious payload is placed in the URL.
