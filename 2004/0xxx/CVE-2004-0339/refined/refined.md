The provided content describes a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in phpBB's `viewtopic.php` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `postorder` parameter in `viewtopic.php` is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code into the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`postorder` parameter) when constructing the page, leading to XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Cookie theft: By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can steal user cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking and unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted URL: The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the `postorder` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious `postorder` parameter. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
