Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2004-0122

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from how MSN Messenger handles file requests. Specifically, the method used to process these requests does not properly validate certain contents when establishing a session. This lack of validation allows for the exploitation of the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation of file request content.
- Failure to sanitize or verify parameters used in file request processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially view the contents of files on the victim's hard drive without the victim's knowledge.
- The attacker can read any file the user has read access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted File Request:** The attacker sends a manipulated file request to the victim's MSN Messenger.
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The attacker can exploit this remotely without needing to authenticate directly to the victim's system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to know the MSN Messenger sign-on name (username) of the victim.
- The attacker must be able to send messages to the victim's MSN Messenger account. If the victim blocks messages from unknown users, the attacker must be on the victim's allowed list.
- The attacker needs to know the path of the file on the victim's system that they want to read.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to MSN Messenger 6.0 and 6.1 and does not affect Windows Messenger.
- The attacker cannot edit or change files; they can only view them.
- The severity of the vulnerability is considered moderate.
- A security update released by Microsoft addresses the vulnerability.
