Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-0845:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in Microsoft Internet Explorer's improper handling of cached HTTPS content. Specifically, IE fails to properly validate cached content obtained via HTTPS, making it vulnerable to cache poisoning.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Validation of Cached HTTPS Content:** IE does not properly verify if cached HTTPS resources are still valid or from the legitimate server.
*   **Caching of HTTPS Content by Default:** IE, by default, caches HTTPS content unless explicitly instructed not to, increasing the attack surface.
*   **Use of "If-Modified-Since" Header:** The vulnerability is exploitable when a web server uses the "If-Modified-Since" header to determine if the browser should use cached content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Spoofing:** An attacker can spoof content on a secure website.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Using malicious script code, an attacker can potentially retrieve cookies or other information from secure web sessions.
*   **Content Modification:** Attackers can replace HTML documents, images, script files (.js), cascading style sheet files (.css), and other static content on a legitimate secured web server.
*   **Malicious Script Injection:**  Attackers can inject malicious scripts, potentially stealing user credentials and sending them to the attacker's server.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **DNS Spoofing/Man-in-the-Middle:** The attacker initially redirects the user's browser to a malicious server using DNS poisoning or a man-in-the-middle attack.
2.  **Malicious Server:** The malicious server hosts fake content intended to poison the browser's cache.
3.  **User Visit to Malicious Server:** The attacker tricks the user into visiting the malicious server, caching the fake content. This can happen through social engineering or by modifying HTTP traffic.
4.  **User Visit to Legitimate Server:** Subsequently, when the user visits the legitimate secured website, the browser loads the attacker's cached content instead of the real resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Control (DNS/MITM):**  The attacker needs to be able to redirect the victim's browser from the legitimate server to their malicious server, either via DNS poisoning or a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
*   **Malicious Server Setup:** The attacker needs a web server to host the fake content, which may include malicious scripts and modified web assets, which will get cached.
*   **Social Engineering (Optional):**  The attacker may need to use social engineering techniques or manipulate traffic to get the user to visit the malicious server.
*  **Persistence:** The attacker does not need to maintain an active connection during the attack on the legitimate site, and the user may even restart the computer in between visiting the malicious and the legitimate website.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The attacker's server provides the malicious content along with a "Last-Modified" header. When the victim later visits the legitimate site, IE includes an "If-Modified-Since" header. The server then may respond with a "304 Not Modified" message to tell the browser to use the cached content.
* The attacker can use any SSL certificate from trusted issuers. The certificate can be long expired or issued for any host name.
*  The attack works with static content like images, script files and css that are often loaded with the "If-Modified-Since" header. HTML pages are also vulnerable as long as they are not the first to be requested via HTTPS.
* The vulnerability does not depend on cache-control headers from the legitimate server, as the attacker's server will always be able to demand that the fake page be cached.
*   HTTP proxy servers that do not decrypt the HTTPS traffic do not affect the vulnerability. Proxies that decrypt and re-encrypt the traffic may escalate or mitigate this issue, depending on the implementation.

This vulnerability is addressed by the patch described in MS04-038.  A workaround is to disable caching of encrypted pages in Internet Explorer's advanced settings.
