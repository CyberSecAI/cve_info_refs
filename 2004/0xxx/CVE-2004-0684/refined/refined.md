- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the way WebSphere Edge Component Caching Proxy handles GET HTTP requests without parameters when the `JunctionRewrite` directive is active and the `UseCookie` option is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of specific HTTP requests leads to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service against the WebSphere Edge Component Caching Proxy, potentially disrupting services relying on the proxy.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker sends a simple GET HTTP request without any parameters to the vulnerable proxy server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable WebSphere Edge Component Caching Proxy server.
