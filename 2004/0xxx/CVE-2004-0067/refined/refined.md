Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in phpGedView:

**1. SQL Injection Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper input validation in `timeline.php` and `placelist.php`. Specifically, the `$level` and `$parent_id` variables are passed directly into SQL queries without sanitization in the `get_place_list()` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL injection.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted URLs with malicious SQL queries in the `level`, `parent` and `pids` parameters, e.g., `/placelist.php?level=1[Evil_Query]`,  `/timeline.php?pids=[Evil_Query]`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**2. Path Disclosure Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** Various scripts improperly handle input, leading to the disclosure of the web server's full path in error messages.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Information disclosure.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Allows attackers to gather information about the server's file structure, which could be used to further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted URLs with specific parameters that trigger errors, such as `/indilist.php?alpha=\&surname_sublist=\`, `/imageview.php?filename=/`, `/login.php?action=login`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** Input is not properly sanitized in multiple scripts, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript code injected into various parameters, such as `/descendancy.php?pid=<iframe>`, `/login.php?url=/index.php?GEDCOM="><iframe>`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have a victim click the link or view the page.

**4. Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The language variable is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to cause a denial of service by setting an invalid language value.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Denial of service.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The victim is unable to access the phpGedView website until they clear their cookies or manually reset the language settings via a valid URI.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted URLs with invalid language parameters, such as `/login.php?&changelanguage=yes&NEWLANGUAGE=[Junk_Here]` or `/index.php?&changelanguage=yes&NEWLANGUAGE=&lt;script&gt;var i=1; while(i){alert(i);};&lt;/script&gt;`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have a victim click the link or view the page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities affect phpGedView versions 2.65 beta 5 and possibly all prior versions.
*   The vulnerabilities have been addressed in the latest beta release available at the provided SourceForge link.
