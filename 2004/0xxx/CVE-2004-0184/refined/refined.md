  "CVE-2004-0184": {
    "description": "The tcpdump tool allows for the inspection of network packets and contains decoders for many standard protocols, including the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP). A flaw exists in the way that tcpdump's ISAKMP decoder handles ISAKMP packets with a malformed Identification Payload. An ISAKMP packet with a malformed Identification payload with a self-reported payload length that becomes less than 8 when its byte order is reversed will cause TCPDUMP to crash as it tries to read from beyond the end of the snap buffer. TCPDUMP must be using a snaplen of 325 or greater for this underflow to be triggered.This condition is only exploitable if tcpdump is invoked with the verbose display option, '-v'.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Integer underflow in the ISAKMP Identification payload handling within the tcpdump ISAKMP decoder.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of byte order conversion during length calculation within the `isakmp_id_print()` function.",
        "Lack of proper bounds checking when reading data from a packet buffer, specifically not validating if the calculated payload length results in a valid buffer access."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the tcpdump application.",
      "attack_vector": "A malformed ISAKMP packet with a manipulated Identification payload is sent to a vulnerable system running tcpdump.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send crafted network packets to a system running tcpdump. The attacker also needs to know that the target is running tcpdump in verbose mode ('-v')."
    },
    "affected_systems": [
      "tcpdump version 3.8.1 and earlier.",
        "Debian",
        "Fedora Project",
        "Gentoo Linux",

        "Slackware",
        "SuSE Inc.",
         "Trustix Secure Linux"
    ],
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered due to an inconsistency in byte order conversion when processing the ISAKMP Identification payload. Specifically, the length of the payload, after byte order reversal, can become less than 8 bytes causing an out-of-bounds read. The vulnerability is only exploitable when tcpdump is run with the verbose option (-v) and a snaplen of 325 or greater."
