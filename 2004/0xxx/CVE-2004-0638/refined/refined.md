- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `DBMS_SYSTEM.KSDWRT()` function within Oracle 8i and 9i.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a buffer overflow. A specially crafted parameter to `KSDWRT()` can cause the overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service, specifically a database crash.
- **Attack vectors:** An Oracle user with execute privileges on the `dbms_system` package can exploit this vulnerability. By default, only DBA users have this access. However, application developers or applications themselves might have this privilege to write messages to the alert.log.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an Oracle user with the ability to execute the `dbms_system` package. This often requires DBA privileges, or in certain cases, access granted to application users or the application itself for logging purposes.
