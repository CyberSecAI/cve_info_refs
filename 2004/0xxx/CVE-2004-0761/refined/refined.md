Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the bug report:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the way Mozilla's `nsHttpChannel` and `nsDocLoaderImpl` handle progress notifications during redirects, specifically when an HTTPS page redirects to an invalid URL. `nsHttpChannel` was sending progress notifications to `nsDocLoaderImpl` before processing headers, causing `nsDocLoaderImpl` to believe that content from the initial HTTPS site was being loaded. This, in turn, triggered the security UI to display the lock icon, even if the final destination was not a secure site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Security Indicator:** The primary vulnerability is that the browser displays a misleading security indicator (lock icon) for a page that is not actually secure. This happens when a secure site redirects the browser to an invalid URL.
*   **Premature Progress Notifications:** The core weakness is in the premature progress notifications sent by `nsHttpChannel` before validating headers. This behavior led `nsDocLoaderImpl` and subsequently the UI to believe content from a secure site was being delivered, leading to a false positive.
*   **Lack of Explicit Security Status:** The UI relies on the URL scheme (HTTPS) rather than explicit security status information from the channel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Certificate Spoofing:** A malicious page can appear to be encrypted with an SSL certificate from another site, even if the page isn't actually served over HTTPS. This can deceive users into believing they're on a legitimate site, leading to potential phishing or data theft.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can create fake login pages that appear secure by using redirects from an actual secure site to an invalid destination, making it easier to steal credentials.
*   **User Deception:** The "host not found" error popup is not sufficient for the average user to realize that the security-icon and certificate are invalid. More sophisticated attacks can bypass this popup by using JavaScript to stop the page load after the redirect.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Initial Redirect:** The attacker first redirects a user to a legitimate HTTPS site.
2.  **Controlled Redirect:** The legitimate HTTPS site is manipulated or chosen to redirect the user to an invalid URL (e.g., `http://a.b&c`).
3.  **JavaScript Exploitation (Advanced):** An attacker can use JavaScript `setTimeout()` and `window.stop()` to prevent the "host not found" popup, making the spoof more convincing.
4.  **Form Submissions:** Although the 307 form redirect requires user prompting, the prompt doesn't reveal the target URL's invalidity, creating a vector for phishing if the user is not careful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server Control:** The attacker needs control of a non-SSL web server to host the initial redirect page.
*   **Redirect Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to either control a redirect on a legitimate HTTPS site or find a site that redirects to an attacker-controlled URL.
*   **Basic Understanding of Web Technologies:** The attacker needs some knowledge of JavaScript (for the more advanced attack scenario), HTTP redirects, and HTML.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is not specific to Firefox, it affects other Mozilla based browsers such as Netscape and Seamonkey.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by modifying `nsHttpChannel` to synthesize `OnProgress` events in `OnDataAvailable` to ensure progress events occur closest to where data is handed to "layout."
*   Changes were also made to `nsDocLoaderImpl` to reset progress totals when switching between upload and download progress reporting.
*   The fix also resolved a separate issue related to cached HTTP loads not generating progress notifications.
