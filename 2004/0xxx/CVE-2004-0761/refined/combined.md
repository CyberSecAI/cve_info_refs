|  | |

User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040113
I believe I have discovered a potential security vulnerability in Mozilla 1.6
and FireFox 0.8. It is likely that the bug also extends to other versions of
Mozilla. The bug is a confidence-hack of sorts, allowing a malicious page to
appear encrypted and present the certificate of another site.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a page on a non-SSL server that has a JavaScript or META redirect to
the SSL-site whose certificate you want to spoof.
2. Your redirect should go to a script on that SSL-site that will redirect you
somewhere else, and you need to be able to control where.
3. Have the SSL-site redirect the browser to an invalid domain (something
syntactically invalid like <http://a.b&c>)
4. Use FireFox 0.8 to browse to the page you created in step 1.
6. An error will popup in FireFox. Click ok.
7. Your browser will still be on the original page from step 1 but the security-
lock icon will still be on in the lower-left corner of FireFox.
8. Click the security icon and click the "View" button to view the certificate.
9. FireFox will present the certificate from the SSL-enabled site.
I've created a simple test-case of the above scenario. I simply searched
on Google for "redirect.cfm" to find any site with a common ColdFusion redirect
script. I found emailfactory.com as the third result in Google. Then I
created a page to redirect the browser to
<https://www.emailfactory.com/redirect.cfm?redirect=a.b&c>. This makes
emailfactory.com redirect the browser to a.b&c, which is invalid and causes
Mozilla to remain on the current page and display a domain not found error.
You can view this example at: <http://www.ttar.org/test.html>
Actual Results:
Mozilla's security icon remained on and clicking it showed the certificate of
the spoofed SSL site.
While there is an error popup notifying the user that Mozilla could not resolve
the domain, that warning is likely not enough for the average user to realize
that the security-icon and certificate visible on the page are invalid.
Expected Results:
The security icon shouldn't be on.
This bug has also been emailed to security@mozilla.org

To make the spoof complete, you should initially link to
<<https://www.emailfactory.com/redirect.cfm?redirect=www.ttar.org/test.html>>.
FYI, the attack does not work when you're behind a proxy, because the proxy will
return (and Mozilla will display) an error page, replacing the old content.

Just an FYI -- Netscape Navigator 7.1 (and likely other versions) is also
vulnerable. In Netscape, the security icon does not turn-on, but if you click
on the "unlocked" security icon, it will still show the cert that belongs to
the spoofed site.
It's very likely that almost anybody embedding Mozilla needs to address this
issue.

With the seamonkey trunk, I get a dialog telling me that I am leaving an
encrypted site and entering an unencrypted site. Next, I get a dialog telling
me that the host a.b&c could not be found. Finally, I am left with the lock
icon set and the old page content. So, this bug is definitely not Firefox specific.
I'm collecting a nsSecureBrowserUI NSPR log now to see if I spot anything in there.
I also confirmed this bug on the Mozilla 1.4 branch.

Most people quickly turn off the "entering" and "leaving" warning dialogs so
they'd only see the host not found error. For bonus points make the invalid host
a typical adserver name and people would actually be glad to see it thinking
they're getting one less ad somewhere.
combine with user@host spoof urls and phishing attacks become that much more
effective.
When I opened page info (in Mozilla) it said explicitly that the site
www.ttar.org supports authentication for the page. Only if you view the
certificate itself do you see it's a different site.

Things just got much worse:
I’ve found a way to use this exploit without having the “host not found” dialog
popup. It’s done using simple JavaScript. First, you call setTimeout() with
about a one second timeout before you set document.location. Then, the
function called by the timeout just calls window.stop(). If the timing is
right, window.stop() will get called after the redirect has comeback from the
spoofed site, but before the host not found dialog pops-up. The result is the
same as the original exploit, but without the suspicious popup.
I’ve combined the above with a much more convincing spoof. Try going to this
URL and imagine that the “Click here” link on this page was placed wisely in a
well-crafted (but fake) email:
<http://www.ttar.org/test_aol.html>
Notice that you’re not really at aol.com when you get the AOL main page – which
contains a login form. However, unlike normal user@host spoofs, this one has
the security-icon show-up as locked AND if you view the certificate, it shows
that it belongs to America Online. This would likely convince any novice user
that they could safely login to this page.
For completeness I’ve changed the action URL on the login form to a CGI at
ttar.org that will print out the username and password that was entered on the
form. This should demonstrate the full potential of this bug.

Here's a log file that I generated by adding PR\_LOG statements to
nsDocLoaderImpl::OnSecurityChange. It shows that there is no call to
OnSecurityChange for <http://a.b&c/>. I think one solution to this bug would be
to suppress OnSecurityChange calls for requests that report a failure status,
but I need to think about that some more to be sure.Assignee: security-bugs → darinStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

Futher investigation reveals that this bug is triggered by the fact that
nsHttpChannel makes calls to nsIProgressEventSink::OnProgress prior to
processing its headers. As a result, the DocLoader observes the nsHttpChannel
downloading content for the URL that results in a redirect. This causes the
DocLoader to send STATE\_TRANSFERRING notifications to its nsIWebProgressListener
array. As a result, the nsSecureBrowserUI thinks that some content will be
displayed for the https:// URL, and we end up with a lock icon. This can't be
solved by the nsSecureBrowserUI since it cannot know (given our APIs) that the
transferred data will actually never be displayed. Yes, it finds out later on
that the URL was redirected (it sees a STATE\_REDIRECTING event), but by then it
is too late... some content was effectively (as far as its concerned) delivered
to layout for rendering.
I believe the correct solution to this bug is to suppress progress notification
until the channel has received and processed its headers. I wrote a patch to do
this and it works; however, there is one problem. We use OnProgress to cause
the UI to be updated with progress of a form submission. That certainly
corresponds to progress prior to receipt of response headers, and unfortunately
our API does not provide an easy way for the observer to distinguish upload from
download. Hmm.....

Actually, I can probably deal with the form submission problem by making
DocLoader suppress OnStateChange from OnProgress until it receives an OnStatus
with nsISocketTransport::STATUS\_RECEIVING\_FROM or nsITransport::STATUS\_READING.
Yeah, that might work well in absence of a better API.

On second thought, the form submission problem is perhaps less of an issue. In
order to replicate this security bug using a form submission, the redirect would
need to be of type 307 in order to preserve the HTTP method when following the
redirect. However, a 307 requires user prompting, which we do. The user would
therefore see a dialog asking them whether or not they wish to submit the
contents of the form to the invalid URI. That may not be much protection. What
do folks think? Should we worry about the form submission case?
Tolga, can you modify your testcase so that it returns a 307 instead of a 302?

This patch is sufficient to fix the bug as reported. It likely does not
protect against the same scenario applied to a form submission redirected via a
307 response.
NOTE: while RFC 2616 states that a user-agent should preserve the request
method in response to a 302, it also comments that most user-agents treat a 302
like a 303. Mozilla likewise behaves contrary to spec for historical
consistency.

Per Darin's request:
<http://ttar.org/test_form.html>
This page contains a form which, when submitted, will submit to an https URL
that returns a 307 to an invalid domain.
Also, if you'd like to cook-up your own test cases, I've created a script on a
SSL-enabled site that will redirect you to any URL with any status code:
<https://app.pbnext.com/test/redirect.em?code=CODE&url=URL>
For example:
<https://app.pbnext.com/test/redirect.em?code=302&url=http://a.b&c>

I tried my new test-case and viewed the form-redirect popup as you'd
indicated. I do not believe this is sufficient for novice users. It only
states that your form submission has been redirected, and that's not that
unusual. Old Netscape used to say that on POST to a 302 and people just
ignored it.
Also, Mozilla does not show the URL that the client is being redirected to.
This means the person will never see that it's invalid.

| [Comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=240053#c17)• 21 years ago |
|  | |

I've considered Darin's solution and the form problem in more depth and:
a) If you think about it, the security lock should actually be on during a POST
while data is uploaded to a secure site. This makes sense because the content
is in-fact being sent over SSL. It's arguable that the lock icon should also
come on during a GET while the request is sent to the server -- since the
request is sent over SSL.
b) However when the redirect comes through, the lock icon should turn off --
before the redirection actually starts.
c) It occurs to me that the lock icon should be turned off at the beginning off
each hit (even internally generated "hits", like a redirect) and turned back on
after an SSL connection has been established and the certificate verified, etc.
d) I don't know much about the Mozilla object model, but it appears that
nsSecureBrowserUi should not assume that a page is secure just because the URL
is an https:// URL. The security-status of a page should be more explicitly
returned to the UI from the channel. This way, it can be turned off at the
beginning of each hit and then turned-back on only after an SSL connection has
been established.
e) Again, I'm not familiar with the Mozilla code. I知 making assumptions only
based on the comments posted in this bug.

So, the problem with the last patch was that it created the possibility that we
wouldn't generate any progress notifications for a channel, and this in turn
means that nsDocLoaderImpl wouldn't generate a STATE\_TRANSFERRING event. That
seems bad given the way the code in nsSecureBrowserUI works.

Here is a more involved patch. It solves both the GET and POST versions of
this bug. I ended up synthesizing OnProgress events in nsHttpChannel::
OnDataAvailable since this was the best way to ensure that the progress events
occur when they should (i.e., closest to where the data is actually handed to
"layout").
I reworked nsHttpTransaction::OnTransportStatus with the changes to
nsHttpChannel in mind. So, it now only sends status messages to the
nsHttpChannel when necessary.
I also had to make changes to nsDocLoaderImpl to make it reset its progress
totals when switching from reporting upload progress to download progress.
A side effect of these changes is that [bug 237958](/show_bug.cgi?id=237958 "RESOLVED FIXED - cached http loads do not generate any progress notifications") is also fixed (due to
synthesized OnProgress in OnDataAvailable).

|  | |

Oh, one other comment:
I also changed nsDocLoaderImpl so that its OnProgress implementation only calls
OnStateChange when data is first downloaded. Previously, as I have mentioned
above, it would call OnStateChange(STATE\_TRANSFERRING) whenever any progress was
reported by the channel. However, we need to do that only in the download case
and not in the upload case. So, this requirement translated to me adding a new
field to nsRequestInfo to flag whether or not we are currently uploading (based
on the previous call to OnStatus).

well, we currently do not send any progress for such a request.. and it doesn't

Couple possibilities:
(1) we are firing DOCUMENT\_START later to all webprogresslisteners, so we start
tearing down the old document a bit later.
(2) we are now reporting progress for cached loads (NOTE: this wouldn't affect
UI since nsBrowserStatusHandler shows number of completed requests over total
number of requests in progress meter. it would only matter when we are loading
a single document.)

nevermind this comment. DOCUMENT\_START happens when the first request is added

Most of the pages are not affected, really. A few got noticeably slowed (lxr
page, quicken page, etc).
The quicken page certainly has stuff it links to (at least on the web). The lxr
page does not. So this could indeed be the cached loads issue (since many of
those loads are cached, I would assume).

At the same time that I submitted this vulnerability to this mailing list and
to bugzilla, I also dropped a note to CERT (knowing the CERT would obviously
keep this confidential for now). CERT has since contacted me and asked several
questions. I've updated them on the general status of this vulnerability and
provided them with a copy of the bug history from Bugzilla.
They also asked me:
"Were you given any indications on the timeline for a fix for this issue?
Likewise, did you have any expectations for publishing your findings
personally? Our preference is give the vendor an opportunity to produce
patches before we would publish something."
I responded to the above question by telling CERT that I would coordinate with
the Mozilla security team prior to releasing anything publicly -- assuming that
such a process was complete by the first week in June. I picked this date very
intentionally because, as far as I can, Mozilla 1.7 final is slated for release
around May 21st. As you all know, this bug has already been fixed in 1.7.
With that, I pose these questions to you:
a) Is Mozilla planning to release a patch that current Mozilla users can use
prior to the release of 1.7 final? My assumption is no.
b) Does the patch that's already been put into CVS fix FireFox as well? Will
others that embed Gecko need to make changes to their code, other than updating
their Gecko engine?
c) Does Mozilla have a list of projects embedding Gecko? Will those projects
be notified by Mozilla? Do you require any assistance in that endeavor?
d) Does Mozilla intend to release their own security announcement, other than
what might be released by CERT or myself?
e) Does Mozilla have a preference or policy regarding the release-date of this
vulnerability? If asked to wait until after the release of 1.7 final, both
CERT and I will. In either case, please provide some guidance on your
preferences.

Answering just the questions I know answers to. Ccing some people who should be
able to answer the rest. Also, you may want to pose those questions to
security@mozilla.org, per
<http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/security-bugs-policy.html>
> b) Does the patch that's already been put into CVS fix FireFox as well?
Yes.

They will not.

Just to clarify -- I did post this to the security list as well. I just
figured it'd be appropriate to post a copy here.

Backport to 1.4 branch
Darin, it would be great if you could take a look at this since I had to do
some conflict resolution, especially in nsHttpTransaction::OnTransportStatus
which looks substantially different than the version you patched against.
I have verified this to plug the hole as demonstrated at
<http://www.ttar.org/test.html>

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
