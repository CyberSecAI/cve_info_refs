Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `delhomepage.cgi` script in NetScreen IVE does not properly sanitize the `row` parameter, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to properly neutralize or encode user-supplied input before using it to dynamically generate a web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Theft of user credentials, including session cookies.
- Execution of hostile client-side scripts with unintended access privileges.
- Phishing attacks by redirecting or mimicking the original site.
- Access to sensitive information related to the vulnerable web page (cookies, form values, URI data).

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker can inject malicious script (JavaScript, VBScript, etc.) or HTML into a web page using a specially crafted `row` parameter in the `delhomepage.cgi` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user since the `delhomepage.cgi` is only accessible to authenticated users.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the exploit in the `row` parameter.

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability affects all versions of the IVE platform since 3.0.
- Patches are available for versions 3.2.1 through 3.3.1
