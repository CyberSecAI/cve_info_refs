#### Vulnerability Note VU#184030

Original Release Date: 2004-07-12 | Last Revised: 2004-07-12

---

### Overview

There is a vulnerability in the password authentication mechanism of MySQL which could allow an attacker to bypass authentication by supplying a zero-length string.

### Description

| MySQL is an open-source database system available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and other UNIX-based operating systems. There is a vulnerability in the check\_scramble\_323() function that could allow an attacker to bypass authentication by supplying a "passwd\_len" value of NULL. It has been reported that versions 4.1 prior to 4.1.3 and version 5.0 are affected.  Note: In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to use a modified MySQL client library. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker with network access to the MySQL server could successfully authenticate without knowledge of the user's password. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**According to the [NGSSoftware Security Advisory](http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/mysql-authbypass.txt), this vulnerability has been fixed in version 4.1.3 (Beta) and version 5.0 (Alpha).Note: Users should exercise caution before installing beta or alpha releases. |
