KDE Security Advisory: kfax libtiff vulnerabilities
Original Release Date: 2004-12-09
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20041209-2.txt
0. References
CAN-2004-0803
CAN-2004-0804
CAN-2004-0886
1. Systems affected:
All KDE releases earlier than KDE 3.3.2.
2. Overview:
Chris Evans and others discovered multiple vulnerabilities
in the libtiff library. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project assigned CAN-2004-0803 to this issue.
kfax, a small utility for displaying fax files, contains
for historic reasons a private copy of libtiff. Therefore
it is vulnerable to these issues as well.
kfax and the kfax KPart are invoked by KMail or Konqueror
for viewing .g3 files.
For the active KDE maintenance branches, which are
KDE 3.2.x and KDE 3.3.x, this problem has been solved by
removing the private copy of libtiff. In KDE 3.2.x, kfax
will use the tiff2ps and fax2tiff utilities at runtime as
backend. In KDE 3.3.x the code requiring libtiff or any other
runtime dependencies has been replaced by a native solution
that is unaffected by the mentioned vulnerabilities.
Due to the complexity of the change, no simple diff is
provided. The problems have been addressed in the KDE 3.3.2
release.
As a workaround, you can remove the kfax binary and the
kfaxpart.la KPart from your system to be on the safe
side.
3. Impact:
Specially crafted fax files can trigger buffer overflows
in libtiff and execute arbitrary code.
4. Solution:
Source code updates have been made available which fix these
vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.
5. Patch:
No patches are being made available due to complexity of the change.
6. Time line and credits:
13/10/2004 KDE Security Team alerted by Than Ngo
28/10/2004 private libtiff fork removed from CVS, updated
packages finished.
XX/11/2004 Regression fixing, several refinements.

Several problems have been discovered in libtiff, the Tag Image File
Format library for processing TIFF graphics files.  An attacker could
prepare a specially crafted TIFF graphic that would cause the client
to execute arbitrary code or crash.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures Project has identified the following problems:

CAN-2004-0803

    Chris Evans discovered several problems in the RLE (run length
    encoding) decoders that could lead to arbitrary code execution.

CAN-2004-0804

    Matthias Clasen discovered a division by zero through an integer
    overflow.

CAN-2004-0886

    Dmitry V. Levin discovered several integer overflows that caused
    malloc issues which can result to either plain crash or memory
    corruption.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.5-6woody1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.1-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libtiff package.

## LibTIFF vulnerable to denial-of-service condition

#### Vulnerability Note VU#555304

Original Release Date: 2004-12-01 | Last Revised: 2005-05-17

---

### Overview

An Integer overflow in the LibTIFF library may allow a remote attacker to cause a divide-by-zero error that results in a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| LibTIFF is a library used to encode and decode images in [Tag Image File Format (TIFF)](http://www.libtiff.org/) format. An integer overflow in the tif\_dirread.c file may allow an attacker to cause a divide-by-zero error. If a remote attacker can persuade a user to access a specially crafted TIFF image with the row bytes field set to zero, that attacker may cause the divide-by-zero error and crash the process that linked to the LibTIFF library.  Any program that uses the LibTIFF library may be affected by this issue. Users are encouraged to contact their vendors to determine if they are vulnerable. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to cause a divide-by-zero error and crash the process linked to the LibTIFF library. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**  Patch or upgrade as specified by your vendor. Users who suspect they are vulnerable are encouraged to check with their vendor to determine the appropriate action to take. |
