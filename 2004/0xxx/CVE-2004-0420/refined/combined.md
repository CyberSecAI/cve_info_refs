## Microsoft Windows contains a vulnerability in the way the Windows Shell launches applications

#### Vulnerability Note VU#106324

Original Release Date: 2004-07-14 | Last Revised: 2004-07-14

---

### Overview

Microsoft Windows contains a remote code execution vulnerability in the way that the Windows Shell launches applications. An remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code if they could trick a user into visiting a malicious website.

### Description

| Microsoft Windows includes a [Shell application programming interface](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/ch11f.asp) (API) that allow integration and extention of the system's operational environment, or *shell*. Some functions of the API enable you to add features to the shell and the user interface components it provides. Others enable you to build similar conventions for your own application. The API supports the ability to associate a class identifier ([CLSID](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/host/2000/all/proddocs/en-us/appint/asdefclassid.mspx)) with a file type. An attacker could create a malicious website or HTML message and use a CLSID instead of the valid extension for a file type to persuade a user to run a malicious program. In order for a remote attacker to exploit this vulnerability, they would have to trick a user into visiting a malicious website. Further actions may be required of the user.  For more information, see Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-024](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-024.mspx).Note that Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-024](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-024.mspx) addresses two other security related issues:In addition to the changes that are listed in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin, this update includes the following changes in functionality:This update refines a change made in Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, which prevents Web pages that are loaded while a user is in the Internet zone from navigating to the Local Machine zone. This change was introduced to mitigate the effects of potential new cross domain vulnerabilities. The changes introduced in this update are additional enhancements of the Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 restrictions.Microsoft has also made another defense in depth change which limits the functionality of the Shell Automation Service ActiveX control (shell.application). This feature has been modified to provide greater security and to prevent potential malicious use. Microsoft considers this to be a defense in depth measure that we are taking to provide additional protection against malicious use. |

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves a newly-discovered, publicly reported vulnerability. A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows Shell launches applications.

If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. However, significant user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

We recommend that customers consider applying the security update.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Windows 98, 98 SE, Me | Windows NT 4.0 | Windows 2000 | Windows XP | Windows Server 2003 |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**I'm still using Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Service Pack 6a or Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, but extended security update support ended on June 30, 2004. However, this bulletin has a security update for these operating system versions. Why is that?**

Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Service Pack 6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 have reached the end of their life cycles as previously documented, and Microsoft extended this support to June 30, 2004. However, the end-of-life for the extended support period occurred very recently. In this case, the majority of the steps that are required to address this vulnerability were completed before June 30, 2004. Therefore, we have decided to release security updates for these operating system versions as part of this security bulletin. We do not anticipate doing this for future vulnerabilities affecting these operating system versions, but we reserve the right to produce updates and to make these updates available when necessary.

It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to future vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Life Cycle, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these operating system versions, visit the following [Microsoft Product Support Services Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;%5bln%5d;lifeanoct2003).

Customers who require additional support for Windows NT Workstation 4.0 SP6a must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/), select the country, and then click Go to see a list of phone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager.

For more information, see the [Windows Operating System FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;%5bln%5d;lifewinfaq).

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces several prior security bulletins. The security bulletin IDs and operating systems that are affected are listed in the table below.

| Bulletin ID | Windows NT 4.0 | Windows 2000 | Windows XP | Windows Server 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [MS03-027](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=17908) | Not Applicable | Not Applicable | Replaced | Not Applicable |
| [MS02-014](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33411) | Replaced | Replaced | Not Applicable | Not Applicable |

**Does this update contain any other changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin, this update includes the following changes in functionality:

* This update refines a change made in Internet Explorer 6 [Service Pack 1](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/downloads/critical/ie6sp1/default.mspx), which prevents Web pages that are loaded while a user is in the Internet zone from navigating to the Local Machine zone. This change was introduced to mitigate the effects of potential new cross domain vulnerabilities. The changes introduced in this update are additional enhancements of the Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 restrictions.
* Microsoft has also made another defense in depth change which limits the functionality of the Shell Automation Service ActiveX control (shell.application). This feature has been modified to provide greater security and to prevent potential malicious use. Microsoft considers this to be a defense in depth measure that we are taking to provide additional protection against malicious use.
* An additional defense in depth change has been made in Windows 2000. By default, the Windows 2000 Telephony Service is no longer allowed to interact with the desktop. Restoring the ability of this service to interact with the desktop does not expose the affected system to any of the vulnerabilities described in this security bulletin. This feature has been modified to provide greater security and to prevent potential malicious use.

  To restore the original behavior, administrators can edit the registry and set the **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TapiSrv\Type** registry key to the value of **00000120** which represents the Enabled setting. The new value of **00000020** represents the Disabled setting.

**How does the extended support for Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition affect the release of security updates for these operating systems?**

Microsoft will only release security updates for critical security issues. Non-critical security issues are not offered during this support period. For more information about the Microsoft Support Lifecycle policies for these operating systems, visit the following [Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?pr=lifean1).

For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by any of the vulnerabilities that are addressed in this security bulletin?**

No. None of these vulnerabilities are critical in severity on Windows 98, on Windows 98 Second Edition, or on Windows Millennium Edition.

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine if this update is required?**

MBSA will determine if this update is required for Windows 2000 (all versions), Windows XP (all versions), and Windows 2003 (all versions). MBSA does not currently support the full detection of this update for the Windows NT 4.0 product (all versions). For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**Note** After April 20, 2004, the Mssecure.xml file that is used by MBSA 1.1.1 and earlier versions is no longer being updated with new security bulletin data. Therefore, scans that are performed after that date with MBSA 1.1.1 or earlier will be incomplete. All users should upgrade to MBSA 1.2 because it provides more accurate security update detection and supports additional products. Users can download MBSA 1.2 from the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about MBSA support, visit the following [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer 1.2 Q&A; Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsaqa.mspx).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine if this update is required?**

SMS uses MBSA for detection. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update for Windows 2000 (all versions), Windows XP (all versions), and Windows 2003 (all versions). This update is not detected by MBSA for the Windows NT 4.0 product (all versions). However, the file and registry key information that is available in this bulletin can be used to write specific file and registry key collection queries in SMS to detect vulnerable computers. For information about how to deploy updates not supported by MBSA with SMS, please review Knowledge Base article [867832](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;867832&). For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**What component installs the Shell-Integrated Browser (Active Desktop) on my Windows NT 4.0 system?**

Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 can install this component. If you have Internet Explorer 4.0 installed on your system, you might have the Shell-Integrated Browser.

**How do I know if I have Active Desktop installed on my Windows NT 4.0 system?**

Microsoft Knowledgebase Article [216840](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;216840) contains information on how to determine if you have Active Desktop installed on your system.

**Why is there no update available for Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition with Active Desktop?**

Active Desktop is not supported on Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition. For more information see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [186498](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;186497).

## Vulnerability Details

#### Windows Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0420:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows Shell launches applications. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability if a user visited a malicious Web site. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0420:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
* This vulnerability requires significant user interaction to be exploited.

#### Workarounds for Windows Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0420:

None

#### FAQ for Windows Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0420:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is remote code execution vulnerability.

/**N:V** No version checking - Install the program over any previous version.

**Note** These switches do not necessarily work with all updates. If a switch is not available that functionality is necessary for the correct installation of the update. Also, the use of the /**N:V** switch is unsupported and may result in an unbootable system. If the installation is unsuccessful, you should consult your support professional to understand why it failed to install.

For additional information about the supported setup switches, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [197147](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;197147).

**Deployment Information**

For example, to install the update without any user intervention and not force the system to restart, run the following command:

**IE-KB839645-WindowsNT4sp6-x86-ENU.exe**

For information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21125).

**Restart Requirements**

In some cases, this update does not require a restart. The installer stops the required services, applies the update, and then restarts the services. However, if the required services cannot be stopped for any reason or if required files are in use, this update will require a restart. If this occurs, a message appears that advises you to restart.

**Removal Information**

To remove this update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool (or the Add/Remove Programs tool) in Control Panel. Click **Internet Explorer Q839645**, and then click **Change/Remove** (or click **Add/Remove**).

System administrators can use the Ieuninst.exe utility to remove this update. This security update installs the Ieuninst.exe utility in the %Windir% folder. This utility supports the following setup switches:

/**?**: Show the list of supported switches

/**z**: Do not restart when the installation is complete

/**q**: Use Quiet mode (no user interaction)

For example, to remove this update quietly, use the following command:

**c:\windows\ieuninst /q c:\windows\inf\q839645.inf**

**Verifying Update Installation**

* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results pane**, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name box**, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{7ac88637-e78a-4036-a333-f65808b791bc}

  **Note** Confirm that the **IsInstalled** DWORD value with a data value of 1 appears in the registry key.
* **Program Version Verification**

  Confirm that **Q839645** is listed in the **Update Versions** field in the **About Internet Explorer** dialog box

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and to perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, see the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/evaluation/capabilities/patch.mspx). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/20/featurepacks/suspack/) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, see the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sms/sms2003/patchupdate.mspx). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/sms/2003/downloads/featurepacks/adminpack.mspx) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/20/featurepacks/adminpack/)) to install these updates.
