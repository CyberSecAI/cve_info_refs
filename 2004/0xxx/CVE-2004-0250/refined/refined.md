- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in ReviewPost PHP Pro.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerabilities exist in `showproduct.php` and `showcat.php` scripts due to lack of proper sanitization of user input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to influence SQL query logic, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `product` and `cat` parameters in `showproduct.php` and `showcat.php` respectively.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the affected server. No prior authentication or specific network position is required.
