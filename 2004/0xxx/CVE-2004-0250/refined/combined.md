ZH2004-04SA (security advisory): Multiple Sql Injection Vulnerabilities in ReviewPost \
PHP Pro

Published: 04 february 2004

Released: 04 february 2004

Name: ReviewPost PHP Pro

Affected Systems: current and prior versions

Issue: Sql Injection Vulnerability

Author: G00db0y from Zone-h Security Labs - zetalabs@zone-h.org

Vendor: <http://www.reviewpost.com>

Description

***********

Zone-h Security Team has discovered a flaw in PhotoPost PHP Pro. There is a \
vulnerability in the current version (and also in prior versions) of PhotoPost PHP \
Pro that allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information that could be used to \
gain unauthorized access. "Your community of users represents a wealth of knowledge. \
Now your users can help build and maintain your site by writing reviews of any \
product imaginable. With ReviewPost, you will quickly amass a valuable collection of \
user opinions about products that relate to your site."

Details

*******

The problems exist due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data. A remote \
attacker may exploit these issues to influence SQL query logic to disclose sensitive \
information that could be used to gain unauthorized access.

For example try this:

<http://address/directory/showproduct.php?product=>[query]

<http://address/directory/showcat.php?cat=>[query]

Solution:

*********

The vendor has been contacted and a patch was produced:
