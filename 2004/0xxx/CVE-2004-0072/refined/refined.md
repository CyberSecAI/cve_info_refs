  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Accipiter Direct Server 6 is vulnerable to directory traversal due to insufficient input validation when handling HTTP requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal",
      "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can retrieve arbitrary files from the server by crafting specific HTTP requests, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP requests with directory traversal sequences (e.g., '%5c%2e%2e%5c')"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, typically through a web browser."
