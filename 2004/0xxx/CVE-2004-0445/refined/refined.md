- A compressed name pointer within the DNS packet can trigger an infinite loop in the kernel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected system.
- The system may require a reboot to restore functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, leveraging specially crafted DNS response packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
