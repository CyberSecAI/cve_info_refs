## BGP implementations do not adequately handle malformed BGP OPEN and UPDATE messages

#### Vulnerability Note VU#784540

Original Release Date: 2004-06-16 | Last Revised: 2004-06-28

---

### Overview

Multiple implementations of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) contain vulnerabilities related to the processing of UPDATE and OPEN messages. The impacts of these vulnerabilities appear to be limited to denial of service.

### Description

| BGP (RFC [1771](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1771.txt)) is designed to exchange network reachability information between peer nodes. Information advertised by a BGP system to its peers includes timers, metrics, and paths to different Autonomous System (AS) networks. Routing between AS networks depends on BGP, and the Internet is a network of AS networks. Therefore, vulnerabilities in BGP have the potential to affect the Internet infrastructure.  Multiple BGP implementations contain vulnerabilities handling exceptional OPEN and UPDATE messages. While the details of the individual vulnerabilities are different, the impacts appear to be limited to denial of service. In addition, most BGP implementations do not accept messages from arbitrary sources. Some BGP implementations only accept TCP connections (179/tcp) from properly configured peers, and some implementations require a valid AS number in the BGP message data. To deliver malicious messages to such systems, an attacker would need to spoof a TCP connection or have access to a trusted BGP peer. The attacker may also need to know a valid AS number.For information about specific BGP implementations, please see the Systems Affected section below. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can cause a denial of service in a vulnerable system. In most cases, the attacker would need to act as a valid BGP peer. BGP session instability can result in "flapping" and other routing problems that may adversely affect Internet traffic. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch or upgrade**Apply a patch or upgrade as specified by your vendor. |
| --- |

| **Restrict BGP access**Using access control lists (ACLs) and BGP configuration settings, restrict access to valid networks and BGP peers.**Authenticate BGP messages**TCP MD5 (RFC [2385](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2385.txt)), IPsec, and [S-BGP](http://www.net-tech.bbn.com/sbgp/draft-clynn-s-bgp-protocol-01.txt) provide cryptographic authentication of network connections and/or BGP messages. Various performance and key distribution issues are associated with these authentication methods.**Use out-of-band management channels**When possible, use an out-of-band channel, such as a separate network, to transmit BGP other management traffic. |

### [Redback Networks Inc.](#AAMN-5ZZL39) Affected

Notified:  May 07, 2004  Updated: June 21, 2004

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

1. SmartEdge family of products is not vulnerable.

2. SMS Family of products is vulnerable in one case.

Mitigation: While there is no way a network operator can completely defend against various vulnerabilities and hacker attacks, Redback Networks products already implement many mechanisms to guard against such attacks.

SMS has the following features, which make the system more secure:

+ MD5 authentication for BGP
+ IP source address validation

Vulnerability Resolution: While there is no way a network operator can completely defend against these types of vulnerabilities, Redback has also incorporated additional modifications within the BGP Protocol that provides more favorable connectivity capable of avoiding the above adverse condition.
