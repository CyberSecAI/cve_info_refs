Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2004-0653, which is related to Sun Solaris patches logging passwords in clear text.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a debugging feature in the `pam_krb5` module within certain Sun Solaris patches. When the debug feature is enabled, the password authentication process logs user passwords in clear text. Specifically, the patches `112908-12` and `115168-03` for Kerberos on Solaris are affected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Clear Text Logging:** The core issue is that the `pam_krb5` module, when debug mode is active, logs passwords in plain text, which is a significant security vulnerability.
*  **Vulnerable Patches:** Patches intended to address other Kerberos issues introduced this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Exposure:** A local user who has access to log files can read other users' passwords in clear text. This enables unauthorized access to accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the affected Solaris system's log files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker must be a user with access to the file system where logs are stored on the vulnerable system.
*  **Knowledge of Log Locations**: The attacker must be aware of where the relevant log files are stored.
*   **Debug Feature Enabled:** The vulnerability is only exploitable if the `debug` feature is enabled within the `pam_krb5` configuration.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists on systems configured as Kerberos clients with the specified patches installed.
*   The vulnerability is related to systems using `pam_krb5` as an "auth" module.
*   The logged password information is written at `LOG_DEBUG` level.
* The Security Tracker link provided gives a date of 06/23/2004, which is different than what is stated in the vulnerability note (06/17/2004).
