The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in PHPGEDVIEW 2.61, including:

**1) PHP Code Injection:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application uses user-supplied input (`$PGV_BASE_DIRECTORY`) in `require` statements without proper sanitization. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in `authentication_index.php`, `functions.php`, and `config_gedcom.php`.
*   **Vulnerability:**  PHP code injection via the `$PGV_BASE_DIRECTORY` parameter.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can include arbitrary PHP code from a remote server, allowing for full system compromise by executing malicious code on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET requests to vulnerable files (`authentication_index.php`, `functions.php`, `config_gedcom.php`) with a malicious URL in the `PGV_BASE_DIRECTORY` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to host a PHP script on a server accessible via HTTP.

**2) Configuration Reset:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `editconfig.php` file, which allows for reconfiguration of the application, is not deleted after installation.
*   **Vulnerability:** The application allows an attacker to re-run the configuration script `editconfig.php`.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can re-install the application and change the administrator password, resulting in complete loss of control over the application.
*   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to `editconfig.php` via a web browser.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to access the `editconfig.php` file on the target server.

**3) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not sanitize user input in the search functionality.
*   **Vulnerability:** XSS vulnerability through the `firstname`, `lastname`, `place` and `year` parameters in `search.php`.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious client-side scripts, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the website.
*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulated URL in `search.php` via the `firstname` parameter, injecting javascript code.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker only needs a web browser and to craft a malicious URL.

**4) Server Information Disclosure:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `admin.php` script allows access to `phpinfo()` output.
*  **Vulnerability:**  Exposure of phpinfo() via `admin.php`.
*   **Impact:** The `phpinfo()` output can reveal sensitive information about the server configuration, potentially aiding further attacks.
*  **Attack Vector:** Direct access to `admin.php?action=phpinfo`.
*  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker only needs a web browser and to craft a malicious URL.
