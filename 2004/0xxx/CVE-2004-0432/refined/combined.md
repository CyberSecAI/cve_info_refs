How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2004-0025

Package name:      libpng proftpd
Summary:           Potential security holes
Date:              2004-04-30
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.0
                   Trustix Secure Linux 2.1
                   Trustix Secure Enterprise Linux 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:

  libpng:
  A library of functions for creating and manipulating PNG
  (Portable Network Graphics) image format files.

  proftpd:
  An enhanced FTP server with a focus toward simplicity, security,
  and ease of configuration.  It features a very Apache-like configuration
  syntax, and a highly customizable server infrastructure, including
  support for multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and
  permission-based directory visibility.

Problem description:

  libpng:
  Steve Grubb discovered that libpng would access memory that is out of
  bounds when creating an error message. The impact of this bug is not
  clear, but it could lead to a core dump in a program using libpng, or
  could result in a DoS (Denial of Service) condition in a daemon that
  uses libpng to process PNG images.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2004-0421 to this issue.

  proftpd:
  A portability workaround was applied in version 1.2.9 of the FTP
  server ProFTPD. As a side-effect, CIDR based (aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd/NN)
  ACL entries in "Allow" and "Deny" directives act like a "AllowAll"
  directive and so FTP clients are granted access to files and
  directories although the server configuration explicitly deny this
  access.

  This issue only affects proftpd 1.2.9, which is shipped with Trustix
  Secure Linux 2.1 and Trustix Secure Enterprise Linux 2.  Trustix Secure
  Linux 2.0 uses proftpd 1.2.8, and is NOT affected by this issue.

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
  package, you may want to remove it from your system.

Location:
  All Trustix Secure Linux updates are available from
  <URI:<http://http.trustix.org/pub/trustix/updates/>>
  <URI:ftp://ftp.trustix.org/pub/trustix/updates/>

About Trustix Secure Linux:
  Trustix Secure Linux is a small Linux distribution for servers. With focus
  on security and stability, the system is painlessly kept safe and up to
  date from day one using swup, the automated software updater.

Automatic updates:
  Users of the SWUP tool can enjoy having updates automatically
  installed using 'swup --upgrade'.

Public testing:
  Most updates for Trustix Secure Linux are made available for public
  testing some time before release.
  If you want to contribute by testing the various packages in the
  testing tree, please feel free to share your findings on the
  tsl-discuss mailinglist.
  The testing tree is located at
  <URI:<http://tsldev.trustix.org/horizon/>>

  You may also use swup for public testing of updates:

  site {
      class = 0

      regexp = ".*"
  }

Package:             proftpd
Vulnerability:       privilege escalation
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:        Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= proftpd-1.2.9-20040207 >= proftpd-1.2.10rc1-20040429
OpenPKG 2.0          <= proftpd-1.2.9-2.0.0    >= proftpd-1.2.9-2.0.1
OpenPKG 1.3          N.A.                      none

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  A portability workaround was applied in version 1.2.9 of the FTP
  server ProFTPD [[1]](#1). As a side-effect, CIDR based (aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd/NN)
  ACL entries in "Allow" and "Deny" directives act like an "AllowAll"
  directive and so FTP clients are granted access to files and
  directories although the server configuration might explicitly deny
  this [[2]](#2).

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  proftpd". If you have the "proftpd" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution) [3][[4]](#4).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [[5]](#5), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [[6]](#6) or a mirror location,
  verify its integrity [[7]](#7), build a corresponding binary RPM from it
  [[3]](#3) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary RPM
  [[4]](#4). For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.0, perform the following
  operations to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases
  adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.0/UPD
  ftp> get proftpd-1.2.9-2.0.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig proftpd-1.2.9-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild proftpd-1.2.9-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ su -

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2267#c0)  Jindrich Makovicka    2003-11-04 16:27:39 UTC  ``` Address restrictions in the form of Allow aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd/NN act like AllowAll, because of the comparison commented out using #if 0. However, the following "return 1" remained in the code so the comparison is left out and success is returned. I have tried the following modification, which seems to make it work again, at least for IPv4.  --- proftpd/src/dirtree.c	1 Nov 2003 07:11:07 -0000	1.125 +++ proftpd/src/dirtree.c	4 Nov 2003 21:18:25 -0000 @@ -1556,10 +1556,14 @@      if (cidr_mode) {  /* NOTE: encapsulation breakage note/IPv6 change needed here. */ -#if 0 -    if ((cli_addr->s_addr & htonl(cidr_mask)) == cidr_addr.s_addr) -#endif + +      if (pr_netaddr_get_family(cli_addr) == AF_INET) { +	  struct in_addr *cli_in_addr = pr_netaddr_get_inaddr(cli_addr); +	  if ((cli_in_addr->s_addr & htonl(cidr_mask)) == cidr_addr.s_addr) {        return 1; +	  } +      }; +      } else {      pr_netaddr_t *acl_addr = NULL; ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2267#c1)  TJ Saunders    2003-11-09 21:05:40 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 2275](show_bug.cgi?id=2275 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CIDR in Allow/Deny broken") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2267#c2)  TJ Saunders    2003-11-18 01:52:46 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 2285](show_bug.cgi?id=2285 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - \"Allow from 10.10.224.0/19\" doesn't work") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2267#c3)  TJ Saunders    2003-11-18 02:25:14 UTC  ``` This should hopefully be fixed in the current CVS sources. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2267#c4)  John Morrissey    2003-12-26 11:35:13 UTC  ``` Resolved in 1.2.9(?). ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2267#c5)  Jindrich Makovicka    2004-01-02 07:50:21 UTC  ``` No, it got _broken_ in 1.2.9.
