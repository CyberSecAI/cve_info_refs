Phorum 3.4.5 Vulnerabilities

-----------------------------
Credit:
Author:     : Calum Power
Version(s)  : <= 3.4.5
Vendor      : Phorum
Vendor URL  : <http://phorum.org>

Vendor Contacted: Yes
Vendor Fix: Phorum has released Phorum v3.4.6 as a response to this
advisory. Please patch your vulnerable software ASAP.

Vulnerabilitiy:
Type: Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection
Severity: Moderately Critical

Summary:
Phorum  versions prior to 3.4.6 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting and
SQL injection bugs that could allow for the remote compromise of any
server running the affected software.

Details:
VULN #1:
    An XSS vulnerability exists in the script 'common.php' that allows
arbitrary code
    execution on the client-side browser.
    Ironically, this vulnerability is in the 'phorum_check_xss()' function.
    The vulnerable code is below:
        if(!is_array($value) && $key!="body" && $key!="subject" &&
$key!="hide" && stristr($value, "<script")){
            echo "script detected in $key";
    By sending a HTTP/POST variable to any Phorum script, an attacker
could craft the key of the variable into
    an XSS attack, providing the value of the variable contains the string
"<script".

    *** This vulnerability has been fixed in Phorum 5.0.2alpha. ***

    Severity: Medium - This vulnerability may be exploited to obtain user
login details, spam, or perform social-engineering upon the user.

VULN #2:
    Another XSS vulnerability exists in the script 'profile.php'. This
vulnerability exists via insufficient
    sanitization of the variable 'EditError'. If a user is logged on, an
attacker could use this vulnerability
    to include arbitrary code on the user's browser.
    NOTE: Phorum (common.php) does checks for '<script>' tags, however XSS
attacks are NOT limited to just the
    <script> tags! An attacker could use many forms of XSS (such as
<iframe>) to launch attacks upon users.
    *** This vulnerability has been fixed in Phorum 5.0.2alpha. ***

    Severity: Medium/Low - This can only be exploited when the user is
logged on, but as such could be used to reset passwords, or change any
other user info without the user knowing.

VULN #3:
    Once again, there is an XSS vulnerability in the script 'login.php'
that may allow attackers to execute
    arbitrary code in the users' browser (Woah, deja moo...)
    This exploit is due to (again) the 'Error' variable not being
sanitized correctly.
    I have created Proof-of-Concept code (using an <iframe>) that allows
for the stealing of user passwords as they are
    submitted into the form.
    *** This vulnerability has been fixed in Phorum 5.0.2alpha. ***

    Severity: High/Critical - Due to the nature of the page, sensitive
form values could be harvested by an attacker.

VULN #4:
    A SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the script 'register.php' in
the field 'hide_email'.
    This vulnerability could lead to the execution of SQL commands inside
the script.
    *** This code appears to not exist in Phorum 5.0.2alpha, so is
therefore fixed. ***

    Severity: High - Due to the location in which the SQL injection
variable is placed, it is increasingly hard to exploit this
vulnerability to obtain any sort of privilege escalation.

Information Security is like decent coffee - When you have it it's
blissful, but it disappears just as you get a taste for it.

Title: Multiple vulnerabilities in Phorum Forum package
Date: 24-12-2003

Vendor Description:
Phorum is a web based message board written in PHP. Phorum is designed with \
high-availability and  visitor ease of use in mind. Features such as mailing list \
integration, easy customization and simple  installation make Phorum a powerful \
add-in to any website.

Affected versions:
All vulnerabilities listed below were found in version 3.4.5 of Phorum.
However, earlier versions could be (and most likely are) affected by these exploits.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
