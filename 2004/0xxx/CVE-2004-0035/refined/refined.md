Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2004-0035:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Location:** `common.php`, `profile.php`, and `login.php`
    *   **Root Cause:**
        *   `common.php`: The `phorum_check_xss()` function attempts to prevent XSS but can be bypassed by crafting HTTP POST variable keys containing `<script>` when the value contains the string "<script".
        *   `profile.php`: Insufficient sanitization of the `EditError` variable.
        *  `login.php`: The `Error` variable is not sanitized correctly.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Inadequate input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data. The `phorum_check_xss()` function only checks for `<script>` tags, which is insufficient as other HTML tags can also be used for XSS.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Attacker crafts malicious HTTP POST requests.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   `common.php`: Arbitrary code execution in the client-side browser; potentially obtain user login details, spam, or perform social engineering.
        *   `profile.php`: Arbitrary code injection in the user's browser when logged in, allowing password reset or modification of user information without user knowledge.
        *   `login.php`: Arbitrary code execution in the user's browser, specifically allowing an attacker to steal passwords submitted through the login form.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP POST requests and knowledge of the vulnerable parameters.

*   **SQL Injection Vulnerability:**
    *   **Location:** `register.php`, specifically the `hide_email` field.
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of sanitization of the `hide_email` field, which is directly used in a SQL query.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input validation.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Attacker crafts a malicious value for the `hide_email` field via HTTP POST request.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary SQL commands.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP POST requests and knowledge of the vulnerable parameters. Difficulty of privilege escalation is noted as being high.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were found in Phorum version 3.4.5 and potentially earlier versions.
*   Phorum version 3.4.6 and later, as well as 5.0.2alpha, address these issues.
*   The advisory highlights the importance of using robust input sanitization for preventing XSS vulnerabilities, as simply checking for `<script>` tags is not sufficient.
