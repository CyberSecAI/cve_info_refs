- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unchecked buffer in the method that DHCP uses to validate a value from specially crafted network packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability in the DHCP server when processing specially crafted DHCP messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to take complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, or creating new accounts with full privileges.
    - Denial of Service (most likely scenario), causing the DHCP server service to fail.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted DHCP message to the DHCP server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Any anonymous user who can deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system.
    - The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server and must be able to communicate with it using the DHCP protocol.
