Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-0385:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap overflow in Oracle Application Server Web Cache due to improper handling of overly long HTTP Request Method headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Overflow:**  The Web Cache process allocates a fixed-size buffer for HTTP headers. Sending a request with an excessively long method header causes a buffer overflow on the heap, overwriting adjacent memory.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The Web Cache does not properly validate the length of the HTTP Request Method header, allowing an attacker to send an oversized header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Web Cache process. On Windows, this typically runs under the Local SYSTEM account, leading to full system compromise. On Unix/Linux, the process usually runs as user ORACLE, potentially allowing complete compromise of the data.
- **Remote System Compromise:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the Web Cache listener port.
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP request with an overly long "HTTP Request Method" header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the Web Cache listener port (typically 7777 for HTTP and 4443 for HTTPS or standard ports 80 and 443).
- **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of HTTP protocol:** The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP request with an oversized method header.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in all platforms supported by Oracle Web Cache.
*   Firewalls that only perform stateful packet inspection at layers 3 and 4 of the OSI model may not protect against this vulnerability.
*   Firewalls with application-level proxy features *may* offer protection.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ioannis Migadakis of InAccess Networks.
