Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper input validation in Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Outlook Web Access (OWA) when processing HTML redirection queries. Specifically, OWA fails to properly sanitize user-provided input before sending it to the browser, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw. An attacker can inject malicious script into a crafted URL, which is then executed in the victim's browser within the security context of the OWA user.
*   **Spoofing:** The vulnerability can be exploited to manipulate web browser caches and intermediate proxy server caches, allowing an attacker to inject spoofed content.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote code execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the victim's browser.
*   **Data access and manipulation:** The attacker can gain access to and manipulate messages and folders on the server with the same privileges as the victim user.
*  **Spoofed Content Injection:** Attackers can inject spoofed content into web browser caches and intermediate proxy server caches.
*   **Cache Poisoning:** By manipulating the cache, attackers could potentially redirect server responses to other users or display spoofed responses to the user.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted URL:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL, often embedded within an email, that contains the malicious script.
*   **User interaction:** The attack requires the victim to click on the crafted URL within the email or other medium.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to send emails:** An attacker needs the ability to send emails to potential victims.
*   **Social engineering:** The attacker must convince the user to click the malicious link in order to trigger the exploit.
*  **Access to Outlook Web Access:** The attacker must be able to log on to Outlook Web Access to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. If anonymous access is disabled, only authenticated users could attempt to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects only Outlook Web Access for Exchange Server 5.5.
*   Outlook Web Access for Exchange 2000 Server and Exchange Server 2003 are not vulnerable.
*   The provided Microsoft bulletin (MS04-026) and CERT vulnerability note (VU#948750) offer guidance on patching and mitigating this vulnerability, which includes disabling Outlook Web Access, applying the patch, and specific configuration recommendations.
