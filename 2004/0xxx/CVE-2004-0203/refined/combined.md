## Microsoft Outlook Web Access contains vulnerability in HTML redirection query

#### Vulnerability Note VU#948750

Original Release Date: 2004-08-11 | Last Revised: 2004-08-11

---

### Overview

A cross-site scripting vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Outlook Web Access (OWA) could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary scripting code in the victim's browser.

### Description

| Outlook Web Access ([OWA](http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/owa/)) is a component of [Microsoft Exchange](http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/). By using OWA, a server that is running Exchange Server can also function as a website that lets authorized users read or send email messages, manage their calendar, or perform other mail functions over the Internet by using a web browser. A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in the way OWA validates user input provided to an HTML redirection query.  By convincing a user to click on a specially crafted URL within an email message, an attacker could cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed in the victim's browser. If executed, the script would have all privileges of the OWA user, including access to and manipulation of messages and folders on the server. |
| --- |

### Impact

| If an attacker can convince a user to follow a link, the attacker could execute script as the victim in the context of the zone in which the Outlook Web Access server resides. For example, this could permit the attacker to gain access to messages stored on the server. According to the [Microsoft Security Bulletin](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-026.mspx):*It may also be possible to exploit the vulnerability to manipulate Web browser caches and intermediate proxy server caches and put spoofed content in those caches.* |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply patch**  Apply a patch as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-026](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-026.mspx). |
| --- |

| **Disable Outlook Web Access**Until a patch can be applied, you may wish to disable Outlook Web Access for each affected Exchange site. You can do this by performing the following steps:   1. Start Exchange Administrator. 2. Expand the Configuration container for the site. 3. Click the Protocols container for the site. 4. Open the properties of the HTTP (Web) Site Settings object. 5. Click to clear the Enable Protocol check box. 6. Wait for the change to replicate, and then verify that this change has replicated to each server in the site. To do this, bind to each server in the site with Exchange Administrator, and then view the setting. |

## Vulnerability Details

#### Cross-site and Spoofing Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0203:

This is a cross-site scripting and spoofing vulnerability. The cross-site scripting vulnerability could allow an attacker to convince a user to run a malicious script. If this malicious script is run, it would execute in the security context of the user. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability require user interaction. This vulnerability could allow an attacker access to any data on the Outlook Web Access server that was accessible to the individual user.

It may also be possible to exploit the vulnerability to manipulate Web browser caches and intermediate proxy server caches, and put spoofed content in those caches.

#### Mitigating Factors for Cross-site and Spoofing Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0203:

* The following supported versions of Outlook Web Access for Exchange are not affected
  + Outlook Web Access for Exchange 2000 Server
  + Outlook Web Access for Exchange Server 2003

**Mitigating factors for cross site scripting attacks**

* An attacker who successfully exploited the cross-site scripting aspect of this vulnerability would only gain the same privileges as the user when using Outlook Web Access.

**Mitigating factors for placing spoofed content in a userâs Web browser cache**

* Clients who have turned on the **Do not save encrypted pages to disk** advanced Internet option in Internet Explorer would not be at risk from any attempts to put spoofed content into the client cache if they accessed their Outlook Web Access site through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

**Mitigating factors for placing spoofed content in an intermediate proxy serverâs cache**

* Clients who use SSL-protected connections to access Outlook Web Access would not be vulnerable to attempts to put spoofed content on intermediate proxy server caches. This is because SSL session data is encrypted and is not cached on intermediate proxy servers.
* If spoofed content is successfully put in an intermediate proxy serverâs cache, it could be difficult for an attacker to predict which users would be served the spoofed cached content.
* An attacker must be able to log on to Outlook Web Access to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. If you do not allow anonymous access to Outlook Web Access, only authenticated users could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Cross-site and Spoofing Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0203:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Disable Outlook Web Access for Each Exchange Site**

  You can disable Outlook Web Access by following these steps. You must follow these steps on each Exchange site.

  1. Start Exchange Administrator.
  2. Expand the **Configuration** container for the site.
  3. Click the **Protocols** container for the site.
  4. Open the properties of the **HTTP (Web) Site Settings** object.
  5. Click to clear the **Enable Protocol** check box.
  6. Wait for the change to replicate, and then verify that this change has replicated to each server in the site. To do this, bind to each server in the site with Exchange Administrator, and then view the setting.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Users cannot access to their mailboxes using Outlook Web Access.
* **Remove Outlook Web Access**

  For steps on how to remove Outlook Web Access, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [290287](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;290287).

[257946](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=257946) XGEN: GUI Hotfix Utility Switches /x /m /s /z

**Deployment Information**

The security update package Exchange5.5-KB842436-x86-<ServerLanguage>.exe contains three separate security updates:

Exchange5.5-KB842436a-x86-<ServerLanguage>.exe

Exchange5.5-KB842436b-x86-<ServerLanguage>.exe

Exchange5.5-KB842436c-x86-<ServerLanguage>.exe

**Note** In the following procedure, we refer to these updates as update "a," "b," and "c" respectively.

This security update has been separated into three parts because of the large number of files that are affected and to reduce the complexity of the installation scripts.

Running the main security update package will copy updates "a," "b," and "c" to a location that you specify. Running each of these updates will install the update on the server.

You must install update "a." Install updates "b" and "c only if your server uses one or more of the client languages that are contained in update "b" or in update "c."

To install the security update:

1. You must install the update (Exchange5.5-KB842436a-x86-<ServerLanguage>.exe) regardless of which languages are installed on the server running Outlook Web Access.

   Update "a" will update the following:

   CDO.dll, CDOHTML.dll, HTMLSNIF.dll, and SAFEHTML.dll.

   You must install the Outlook Web Access language that matches the language that is specified on the server that is running Microsoft Exchange Server.

   The following Outlook Web Access languages are available to install:

   * Chinese (Simplified)
   * Chinese (Traditional)
   * English
   * French
   * German
   * Italian
   * Japanese
   * Spanish
2. After the installation of update "a" finishes, install update "b," update "c," or both. You must install update "b" if any of the following Outlook Web Access languages are installed on your computer:

   * Brazilian (Portuguese)
   * Polish
   * Russian
   * Greek
   * Portuguese
   * Swedish
   * Korean
3. You must install update "c" if any of the following Outlook Web Access languages are installed on your server:

   * Hungarian
   * Norwegian
   * Czech
   * Turkish
   * Finnish
   * Danish
   * Dutch

**Note**You must install update "a" even if you only use languages that are contained in update "b" or in update "c." You must install update "a" to be able to install updates "b" and "c," and for these updates to function properly. You will not be able to install update "b" or update "c" unless you have already installed update "a."

**Note**You must not remove update "a" after you have installed update "b," after you have installed update "c," or both, even if you do not use the languages in update "a." Doing so could prevent updates "b" and "c" from functioning properly.

**Note**Only language packs that are already installed on the server will be updated. If you install update "b" or update "c" on servers where the appropriate languages are not installed, you will not cause any damage.

For more information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21125)

**Note** After you install the update, you might see a blank message body when you open a message in Outlook Web Access if the permissions for the Windows directory on the server that is running Outlook Web Access are set to read-only. For more information about this, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [314532](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=314532).

**Restart Requirement**

This update does not require a restart. However, the update will restart Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), the Exchange Store, and the Exchange System Attendant Services. Therefore, install the update when no users are logged on through Outlook Web Access.

**Removal Information**

To remove this security update, run the following command at a command prompt:

* %EXCHSRVR%\842346a\UNINSTALL\UNINST.EXE
* %EXCHSRVR%\842346b\UNINSTALL\UNINST.EXE

**Verifying Update Installation**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. This tool allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Exchange Server 5.5\SP5\842436a
  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Exchange Server 5.5\SP5\842436b
  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Exchange Server 5.5\SP5\842436c

  **Note** These registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 842436 security update into the Windows installation source files.

### Other Information

**Acknowledgments**

Microsoft [thanks](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21127) the following for working with us to help protect customers:

* Amit Klein of [Sanctum Inc](https://www.sanctuminc.com/). for reporting the Cross-site Scripting and Spoofing Vulnerability (CAN-2004-0203).

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and to perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, see the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, see the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
