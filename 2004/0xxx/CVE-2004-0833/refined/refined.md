```
- Root cause of vulnerability: When installing "sasl-bin" to use sasl in connection with sendmail, the sendmail configuration script uses fixed user/pass information to initialize the sasl database.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use of hardcoded credentials.
- Impact of exploitation: A spammer could utilize a vulnerable sendmail installation to relay spam.
- Attack vectors: Remote
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Knowledge of the fixed user/password and the presence of sendmail with sasl enabled.
