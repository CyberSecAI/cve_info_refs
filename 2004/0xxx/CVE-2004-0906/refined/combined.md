The problem is with the Mozilla1.6 \*.xpi files for Linux - e.g. in
<http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/releases/mozilla1.6/linux-xpi/>
the files were packed with wrong permissions (e.g. world writable 666).
The
<http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/releases/mozilla1.5/linux-xpi/> is
OK. But The same problem is in some nightly builds - in the
<http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/nightly/> seems be in all nightly
builds even in the oldest available build -
<http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/nightly/2003-12-01-12-trunk/linux-xpi/>
Problem in the some packaging script?

Confirming. I just unzipped psm.xpi from the Mozilla 1.6 dir and got a nice
world-writable libnss and libssl.
We need to fix this ASAP; this is a trojan waiting to happen.Flags: blocking1.7a?

This may well be because the default cltbld .cshrc that's on many of the
tinderbox machines (which are now being used for nightlies) has umask 0 in it.
(We probably need to get a common .cshrc set up in cvs somewhere for tinderobxes.)Assignee: general → leaf

1.7a builds will produced exactly the same way the current trunk builds are
produced, so if current trunk builds install with correct permissions, 1.7a will
also have correct permissions. Can a reporter test a trunk build and report back
here?

I just downloaded
<http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/nightly/latest/mozilla-i686-pc-linux-gnu-full-installer.tar.gz>
(which has today's timestamp). I untarred it, then unzipped the resulting
browser.xpi. Here're the permissions on some randomly chosen files that resulted:
-rwxrwxrwx 1 bzbarsky bzbarsky 3797 Feb 15 11:24 mozilla
-rwxrwxrwx 1 bzbarsky bzbarsky 276072 Feb 15 11:24 mozilla-bin
-rwxrwxrwx 1 bzbarsky bzbarsky 4936564 Feb 15 11:24 components/libgklayout.so
So this is definitely still a problem.

If it can help - here is a simple Python script, which shows you Linux
permission in the ZIP file (so you can test the Linux permissions even under
Windows - I am testing the \*.xpi packages in the czech localized add-ons in this
way).
<http://biomikro.vscht.cz/maldiman/hassmanm/projects/testzip.py.txt>
Rename to testzip.py and run e.g.: python testzip.py your.xpi

I fixed the 1.7a release by hand, still need to fix the umask on the build
machine. Working on that today.
(or, better yet, i'll write a patch for the installer to bulletproof permissions)

I think the problem lies here:
<http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/modules/libjar/nsZipArchive.cpp&rev=1.76&mark=644,664#641>
If we pass the right permissions to PR\_Open instead of doing a chmod, things
ought to work.

I think this patch should do what we want (pass the right mode to PR\_Open so
the umask is respected). I need to figure out (a) how to test that it works
and (b) what else needs to be tested.

I can make a test build with this patch (and intentionally make the local
permissions on the files in the zip archives be "bad") and create installers to
test.

|  | |

One potential problem with this patch is that if the file being created already
exists, this won't change the permissions. That seems like it could be a problem.

Didn't seem to work; made clean and rebuilt modules/libjar and xpinstall, then
rebuilt installers.
Dave, can i check in my stupid hack in the while we track down the right way to
make zip work? (like tar).
I'll post it in a separate attachment.

I know this isn't the "right" solution, but it'd be nice if trunk builds didn't
have this vulnerability anymore.

Sorry for off-topic, but if you are making changes in the code of permission of
extracted files, maybe you should also consider [bug #189905](/show_bug.cgi?id=189905 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Under linux have installed files incorrect permission when XPI is made under windows (with bad permissions)") (problem with Unix
permission when the XPI file was packed under DOS/Win) - this does not really
affects Mozilla installation itself, but it is problem of many addons from
mozdev.org.

possible patch
>+ PRFileDesc\* fOut = PR\_Open(aOutname, ZFILE\_CREATE, item->mode);
the installer only calls this via standalone libjar, where PR\_Open is defined
as fopen in zipstub.h, so the perms get ignored. This might be why the chmod
was there instead of passing the mode to PR\_Open (in addition to the case of
overwriting files).
>- rv = localFile->OpenNSPRFileDesc(PR\_RDWR | PR\_CREATE\_FILE, 0664, &fd);
>+ rv = localFile->OpenNSPRFileDesc(PR\_WRONLY | PR\_CREATE\_FILE, item->mode, &fd);
item->mode here does get used, but it didn't help because mode is 0777.
(item->mode & 0755) would work.
there's also a chmod later in this function that got left.
but perhaps
chmod(file, item->mode & 0755);
would work better considering the case of overwriting files.

D'oh -- faulty emulation is always a hazard. Can someone patch zipstub.h to do
the right thing?

or chmod og-w -R $STAGE
755 makes all files (like bookmarks.html and all.js) executable.

I filed [bug 235781](/show_bug.cgi?id=235781 "RESOLVED FIXED - XPInstall ignores user's umask when installing files") for xpinstall issues. But the files still need to be
packaged with appropriate permissions for the non-installer tarballs, if nothing
else.

What do you mean by appropriate? tar uses the umask when writing files, so
appropriate permissions for a tarball should be 0777 or 0666, I'd think.

Same thing, but with old workaround removed and better comments. Note that
this also fixes potential permission problems in the middle of installation of
files with g-r or o-r.

There's been a lot of discussion about this matter in
this bug and also in duplicates. Perhaps this suggestion
is redundant, and if so please excuse me.
I think it would be a good idea for the Firefox installer
script to ask the user at install time whether the
installation is intended for just the user who launched
the install script or for other users as well. It could
also check the value of umask and/or warn the user if
it's not right or possibly reset it for the install.
Although it's true that permission errors can be fixed
by recursive chmod commands, if Firefox is intended for
a broad audience there's going to be a lot of frustration
among non-sysadmin types if it gets installed with the
wrong permissions. This would be very easy to do.

Thomas: That's an interesting suggestion. If you were to file another bug and
stick an example patch in it for feedback and testing, it might get more
attention, though.

# Mozilla, Firefox, Thunderbird, Epiphany: New releases fix vulnerabilities — GLSA **200409-26**

code.

| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.9-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.9-r1** |

### Background

Mozilla is a popular web browser that includes a mail and newsreader.
Epiphany is a web browser that uses Gecko, the Mozilla rendering
engine. Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird are respectively the
next-generation browser and mail client from the Mozilla project.

### Description

Mozilla-based products are vulnerable to multiple security issues.
Firstly routines handling the display of BMP images and VCards contain
an integer overflow and a stack buffer overrun. Specific pages with
long links, when sent using the "Send Page" function, and links with
non-ASCII hostnames could both cause heap buffer overruns.

Several issues were found and fixed in JavaScript rights handling:
untrusted script code could read and write to the clipboard, signed
scripts could build confusing grant privileges dialog boxes, and when
dragged onto trusted frames or windows, JavaScript links could access
information and rights of the target frame or window. Finally,
Mozilla-based mail clients (Mozilla and Mozilla Thunderbird) are
vulnerable to a heap overflow caused by invalid POP3 mail server
responses.

### Impact

An attacker might be able to run arbitrary code with the rights of the
user running the software by enticing the user to perform one of the
following actions: view a specially-crafted BMP image or VCard, use the
"Send Page" function on a malicious page, follow links with malicious
hostnames, drag multiple JavaScript links in a row to another window,
or connect to an untrusted POP3 mail server. An attacker could also use
a malicious page with JavaScript to disclose clipboard contents or
abuse previously-given privileges to request XPI installation
privileges through a confusing dialog.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround covering all vulnerabilities.

### Resolution

All users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv your-version
 # emerge your-version
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=235781#c0)• 21 years ago |
|  | |

When files are installed via XPInstall, the user's umask is ignored. The
XPInstall engine should respect the user's umask setting. The problem code is here:
nsZipArchive::ExtractFile
<http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/modules/libjar/nsZipArchive.cpp#641>
nsJAR::Extract
<http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/modules/libjar/nsJAR.cpp#251>
both open the file with 0644 perms and then chmod the file to the appropriate
perms, but this sidesteps any umask.
Just to make things more complicated, the nsZipArchive is part of standalone
libjar, where PR\_Open is defined as fopen in zipstub.h, so passing the file's
mode to PR\_Open wouldn't work in that situation.
this bug contributed to problems in [bug 231083](/show_bug.cgi?id=231083 "RESOLVED FIXED - wrong file permissions after installation").

|  | |

also note that (as argued against in [bug 111124](/show_bug.cgi?id=111124 "RESOLVED INVALID - Installer complies to umask, setting incorrect permissions")), directories are created with
appropriately umasked permissions here:
<http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpinstall/src/nsInstallFile.cpp#213>

Attached patch

[dbaron's patch minus a chmod](attachment.cgi?id=142404&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=142404&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=235781&attachment=142404)

this is dbaron's patch from [bug 231083](/show_bug.cgi?id=231083 "RESOLVED FIXED - wrong file permissions after installation") except that this patch also removes the
chmod from nsJAR::Extract. This would fix things except for the standalone
libjar/PR\_Open problem.

I'd actually wanted to add an nsIFile::Remove / PR\_Delete before the PR\_Open /
GetANSIFileDesc calls so that it would be creating a new file rather than
reusing an old one that might have different permissions. Otherwise a XPI
couldn't fix permissions that were wrong in an old buggy one, I think.

[add PR\_TRUNCATE and workaround for standalone](attachment.cgi?id=142413&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=142413&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=235781&attachment=142413)

this adds PR\_TRUNCATE to the flags so that permissions are set for existing
files.
this patch also grabs the umask and uses it to chmod the extracted file when
using standalone libjar.

How does this work around the problem for standalone? Anyway, I attached a
patch that does this the cheap way to [bug 231803](/show_bug.cgi?id=231803 "VERIFIED DUPLICATE - Right-click context menus not working correctly on dual-monitor system").

Oh, I do see the workaround for standalone now, but I'd prefer that in a PR\_Open.
Did you test that PR\_TRUNCATE causes the permissions to be used if the file
exists? Based on the documentation of open(2), I'd guess that it wouldn't do so.

The documentation itself is ambiguous, but it worked ok when I actually tested
it (I can't retest right now). It might not be portable though.

It doesn't seem portable to Fedora Core 2. I just did the following test. I
added this to a test program:
PR\_Open("/tmp/mozpermtest", PR\_WRONLY | PR\_CREATE\_FILE | PR\_TRUNCATE, 0700);
ran the test program, and it created /tmp/mozpermtest with 0700 (my umask is 002).
Then I changed the line to this:
PR\_Open("/tmp/mozpermtest", PR\_WRONLY | PR\_CREATE\_FILE | PR\_TRUNCATE, 0666);
and ran the test program again, and the file was still 0700.
