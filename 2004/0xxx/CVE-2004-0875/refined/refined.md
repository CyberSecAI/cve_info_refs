*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the wiki functionality of the phpGroupWare application, and be able to submit malicious input. This could be a user with permission to edit wiki pages or through exploiting other vulnerabilities that might allow such access.
