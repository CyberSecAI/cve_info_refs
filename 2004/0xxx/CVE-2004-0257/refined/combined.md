Description: It is possible to remotely crash openbsd 3.4 if the host receives icmpv6 and there is a listening tcp port. quoting de raadt: "it is just a crash." remote crash which screws the kernel. unknown whether this may be exploited for code execution.  Details: The problem is triggered by setting small ipv6 mtu and then doing tcp connect. How to reproduce: Patch linux kernel 2.4.24 net/ipv6/icmp.c :  `case ICMPV6_ECHO_REPLY:         /* we coulnd't care less */ icmpv6_send(skb, ICMPV6_PKT_TOOBIG, 0, 68, skb->dev); //joro  then: ping6 openbsd ssh -6 openbsd`  Workaround: It is believed that openbsd current is not vulnerable. netbsd current also seems to have related changes. check: http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/sys/netinet6/ip6\_output.c http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/sys/netinet/tcp\_output.c?sortby=date  Vendor status: open, net and free bsd were notified Sun, 1 Feb 2004 16:35:56 +0200  Georgi Guninski http://www.guninski.com | | --- | --- | |

Georgi Guninski posted an advisory on his site about a remote crash in
the OpenBSD kernel caused by connecting with a small IPv6 MTU.

<http://www.guninski.com/obsdmtu.html>

The error was present in revision 1.81 of /src/sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c
and is fixed in revision 1.82 ( 2004/02/04 08:47:41 ), you can see the
colored diffs at

<http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c.diff>
?r1=text&tr1=1.81&r2=text&tr2=1.82&f=h

OpenBSD administrators should pull the revised code from CVS and
recompile their kernels.
