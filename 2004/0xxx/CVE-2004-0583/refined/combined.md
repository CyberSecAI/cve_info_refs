# Usermin: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200406-15**

Usermin contains two security vulnerabilities which could lead to a Denial
of Service attack and information disclosure.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/usermin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.070-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.080** |

### Background

Usermin is a web-based administration tool for Unix. It supports a wide
range of user applications including configuring mail forwarding,
setting up SSH or reading mail.

### Description

Usermin contains two security vulnerabilities. One fails to properly
sanitize email messages that contain malicious HTML or script code and
the other could allow an attacker to lock out a valid user by sending
an invalid username and password.

### Impact

By sending a specially crafted e-mail, an attacker can execute
arbitrary scripts running in the context of the victim's browser. This
can be lead to cookie theft and potentially to compromise of user
accounts. Furthermore, an attacker could lock out legitimate users by
sending invalid login information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version.

### Resolution

Usermin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=app-admin/usermin-1.080"
 # emerge ">=app-admin/usermin-1.080"
```

# Webmin: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200406-12**

Webmin contains two security vulnerabilities which could lead to a Denial
of Service attack and information disclosure.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/webmin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.140-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.150** |

### Background

Webmin is a web-based administration tool for Unix. It supports a wide
range of applications including Apache, DNS, file sharing and others.

### Description

Webmin contains two security vulnerabilities. One allows any user to
view the configuration of any module and the other could allow an
attacker to lock out a valid user by sending an invalid username and
password.

### Impact

An authenticated user could use these vulnerabilities to view the
configuration of any module thus potentially obtaining important
knowledge about configuration settings. Furthermore an attacker could
lock out legitimate users by sending invalid login information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Webmin users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=app-admin/app-admin/webmin-1.150"
 # emerge ">=app-admin/app-admin/webmin-1.150"
```
