### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves several newly-discovered, privately reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own Vulnerability Details section.

If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

We recommend that customers install the update at the earliest opportunity

## Vulnerability Details

#### Table Conversion Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0571:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Word for Windows 6.0 Converter. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for Table Conversion Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0571:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
* The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative privileges.
* This vulnerability does not affect other Word documents, which are handled by separate converters.
* Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 are at a reduced risk to this vulnerability because the affected component is disabled by default. These operating systems are only vulnerable if an administrator has manually enabled the affected component.
* WordPad is vulnerable to this issue through .wri, .rtf, and .doc file name associations. By default, if any supported version of Microsoft Word is installed, through the .rtf and .doc file associations, these document types will open in Microsoft Word instead of WordPad. Microsoft Word does not contain this vulnerability. WordPad could also be used to manually open malicious documents; this could include files with file name extensions other than .wri, .rtf, and .doc because WordPad will process the malicious document the same regardless of the file name extension.

#### Workarounds for Table Conversion Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0571:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and to perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, see the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
