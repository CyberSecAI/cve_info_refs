Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2004-0956, which is associated with multiple vulnerabilities in MySQL:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The content describes three distinct vulnerabilities:
1. **Privilege Check Bypass:** Incorrect privilege checking during `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME` operations. The system was checking permissions on the old table instead of the new one, also a bug allowed users to grant rights on databases they had no rights on.
2. **Denial of Service (DoS) via MERGE tables:** Multiple threads concurrently altering MERGE tables by changing the UNION could lead to server crashes.
3. **DoS and Potential Remote Code Execution via Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow in the `mysql_real_connect` function due to insufficient bounds checking. Additionally, a crash was caused by a double quote in the query string that did not have a closing double quote when using MATCH ... AGAINST queries, which was related to a previous bug.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1. **Incorrect Privilege Checks:** The system failed to properly validate permissions when renaming tables, also failed on database privilege granting.
2. **Race Condition:** Concurrent modification of MERGE tables could lead to a crash.
3. **Buffer Overflow:** The `mysql_real_connect` function was vulnerable to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing attackers to overwrite memory. Additionally, a missing closing double quote when using MATCH ... AGAINST queries leads to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1. **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers could bypass expected restrictions on database operations by exploiting the incorrect privilege checks and grant access where it should be denied.
2. **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting the threading issue or the crash related to MATCH ... AGAINST queries or the buffer overflow could lead to a DoS by crashing the MySQL server.
3. **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In the case of the buffer overflow, it could potentially allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the MySQL daemon (typically the "mysql" user).

**Attack Vectors:**

1. **Network:** Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities remotely if they have network access to the MySQL server.
2. **SQL Queries:** The vulnerabilities involving the `ALTER TABLE` command, the MERGE table manipulation, and the `MATCH ... AGAINST` query could be triggered by sending crafted SQL queries to the server.
3. **Connection Handling:** The buffer overflow vulnerability could be triggered during connection setup if the attacker can manipulate the parameters passed to `mysql_real_connect`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the MySQL server.
2.  **MySQL User Account:** Attackers require a valid MySQL user account to connect to the server and execute SQL queries, or the ability to establish a connection to trigger the `mysql_real_connect` buffer overflow.
3. **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** Attackers must have knowledge of the vulnerabilities, though no specific PoC exploit is described in the provided content, the bug report provides details on how to cause the crashes.

The provided content offers more detailed information than the typical CVE description, particularly regarding the specific conditions causing crashes with MERGE tables and `MATCH ... AGAINST` queries, along with the technical details about the buffer overflow vulnerability.
