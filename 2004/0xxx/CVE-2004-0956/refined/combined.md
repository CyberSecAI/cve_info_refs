## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

# MySQL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200410-22**

Several vulnerabilities including privilege abuse, Denial of Service, and
potentially remote arbitrary code execution have been discovered in MySQL.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/mysql** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.21** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.21** |

### Background

MySQL is a popular open-source, multi-threaded, multi-user SQL database
server.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in MySQL:

Oleksandr Byelkin found that ALTER TABLE ... RENAME checks CREATE/INSERT
rights of the old table instead of the new one (CAN-2004-0835). Another
privilege checking bug allowed users to grant rights on a database they had
no rights on.

Dean Ellis found a defect where multiple threads ALTERing the MERGE tables
to change the UNION could cause the server to crash (CAN-2004-0837).
Another crash was found in MATCH ... AGAINST() queries with missing closing
double quote.

Finally, a buffer overrun in the mysql\_real\_connect function was found by
Lukasz Wojtow (CAN-2004-0836).

### Impact

The privilege checking issues could be used by remote users to bypass their
rights on databases. The two crashes issues could be exploited by a remote
user to perform a Denial of Service attack on MySQL server. The buffer
overrun issue could also be exploited as a Denial of Service attack, and
may allow to execute arbitrary code with the rights of the MySQL daemon
(typically, the "mysql" user).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MySQL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=dev-db/mysql-4.0.21"
 # emerge ">=dev-db/mysql-4.0.21"
```

Description:
Crashes on query

How to repeat:

Suggested fix:

The table is fine according to 'check table the_table_name'. The select crashes it. The select also crashes it in older versions of myslq!! Doing a repair in the old version and then doing the select in the old version is OK. That is why I came to the conclusion that the file is corrupt. CHECK TABLE does not find the corruption, however.

Another note on this: The tables I had the most problems with had FTS indicies. I can't say that it is more than coincidental just yet. I am not conclusive that it is a cause and effect relationship at this time.

Even returning to the older versions of mysql is not getting rid of all our problems (we are seeing extremely high loads on the same stream of queries as usual). Selectively repairing tables has helped. It may be that it is not FTS related and we should repair all tables.

Thank you for your bug report. This issue has been committed to our
source repository of that product and will be incorporated into the
next release.

If necessary, you can access the source repository and build the latest
available version, including the bugfix, yourself. More information
about accessing the source trees is available at
    http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Installing_source_tree.html

Additional info:

got it now, thanks.
It's your [bug#2708](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=2708) which was fixed in 4.1 tree only.
Actually there is another bugfix required ("phase search" match "paraphrase searches" - that is, don't respect word boundaries) for this crash to be visible.

In 4.0.20 I ported bugfix for the latter bug from 4.1.2 to 4.0.20 :(
Ok, I'm backporintg the fix for [bug#2708](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=2708) now.
```

[18 Jun 2004 13:20]

```
just to clarify - the crash was caused by a double quote in the query string (like MATCH ... AGAINST (' some " query' IN BOOLEAN MODE) ) that did not have a matching closing double quote.
```

-- Log info --
Trying to get some variables.
Some pointers may be invalid and cause the dump to abort...
thd->query at 0x84ca310 = SELECT * FROM partall WHERE    MATCH
(partsno,description,mfg) AGAINST(' +19"* +TFT*' IN BOOLEAN MODE) AND mfg LIKE
'%%%%' AND spe

Anyway the following query crashes the system
SELECT * FROM partall WHERE    MATCH (partsno,description,mfg) AGAINST(' +22"*
+inch*' IN BOOLEAN MODE) AND mfg LIKE '%%%%' AND special LIKE '%%%%'  LIMIT 250

I have tried multiple formats of the search and found that its the " in the
AGAINST statement that causes the problem, I found multiple times mysql auto
recovered due to this, only noticed it today because the mysql failed to auto
restart
