# GAIM 0.75 Remote overflows — GLSA **200401-04**

Various overflows in the handling of AIM DirectIM packets was revealed in
GAIM that could lead to a remote compromise of the IM client.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-im/gaim** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.75-r7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.75-r7** |

### Background

Gaim is a multi-platform and multi-protocol instant messaging
client. It is compatible with AIM , ICQ, MSN Messenger, Yahoo,
IRC, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu, and the Zephyr networks.

### Description

Yahoo changed the authentication methods to their IM servers,
rendering GAIM useless. The GAIM team released a rushed release
solving this issue, however, at the same time a code audit
revealed 12 new vulnerabilities.

### Impact

Due to the nature of instant messaging many of these bugs require
man-in-the-middle attacks between the client and the server. But
the underlying protocols are easy to implement and attacking
ordinary TCP sessions is a fairly simple task. As a result, all
users are advised to upgrade their GAIM installation.

* Users of GAIM 0.74 or below are affected by 7 of the
  vulnerabilities and are encouraged to upgrade.
* Users of GAIM 0.75 are affected by 11 of the vulnerabilities
  and are encouraged to upgrade to the patched version of GAIM
  offered by Gentoo.
* Users of GAIM 0.75-r6 are only affected by
  4 of the vulnerabilities, but are still urged to upgrade to
  maintain security.

### Workaround

There is no immediate workaround; a software upgrade is required.

### Resolution

All users are recommended to upgrade GAIM to 0.75-r7.

```
 $> emerge sync
 $> emerge -pv ">=net-im/gaim-0.75-r7"
 $> emerge ">=net-im/gaim-0.75-r7"
```

     Advisory: 12 x Gaim remote overflows
 Release Date: 2004/01/26
Last Modified: 2004/01/26
       Author: Stefan Esser [s.esser@e-matters.de]

  Application: Gaim <= 0.75
     Severity: 12 vulnerabilities were found in the instant
               messenger GAIM that allow remote compromise
         Risk: Critical
Vendor Status: Vendor has fixed in CVS, but feels not ready for
               release because of problems with HEAD
    Reference: <http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012004.html>

Overview:

   Gaim is a multi-protocol instant messaging client for Linux, BSD,
   MacOS X, and Windows. It is compatible with AIM (Oscar and TOC
   protocols), ICQ, MSN Messenger, Yahoo, IRC, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu,
   and Zephyr networks. It is a very popular choice among the users
   of instant messaging networks and especially in the community of
   migrated windows users.

   While developing a custom add-on, an integer overflow in the
   handling of AIM DirectIM packets was revealed that could lead
   to a remote compromise of the IM client. After disclosing this
   bug to the vendor, they had to make a hurried release because
   of a change in the Yahoo connection procedure that rendered
   GAIM useless. Unfourtunately at the same time a closer look
   onto the sourcecode revealed 11 more vulnerabilities.

   The 12 identified problems range from simple standard stack
   overflows, over heap overflows to an integer overflow that can
   be abused to cause a heap overflow. Due to the nature of instant
   messaging many of these bugs require man-in-the-middle attacks
   between client and server. But the underlying protocols are
   easy to implement and MIM attacks on ordinary TCP sessions is
   a fairly simple task.

   In combination with the latest kernel vulnerabilities or the
   habit of users to work as root/administrator these bugs can
   result in remote root compromises.

Details:

   While auditing the Gaim source code the following 12
   vulnerabilities were discovered:

   Overflows in YMSG protocol (yahoo messenger) handler
   ----------------------------------------------------

   01) Yahoo Octal-Encoding Decoder Overflow
   02) Yahoo Octal-Encoding Decoder Out-Of-Bounds Overflow
   03) Yahoo Web Cookie Parser Overflow
   04) Yahoo Login Page Name Parser Overflow
   05) Yahoo Login Page Value Parser Overflow
   06) Yahoo Packet Parser Overflow

   Overflows in oscar protocol (AIM) handler
   -----------------------------------------

   07) AIM/Oscar DirectIM Integer Overflow

   Overflows in utility functions
   (called in various protocols)
   ------------------------------

   08) Quoted Printable Decoder Overflow
   09) Quoted Printable Decoder Out-Of-Bounds Overflow
   10) URL Parser Function Overflow
   11) Extract Info Field Function Overflow

   Overflows that do not fit into
   the other categories
   ------------------------------

   12) HTTP Proxy Connect Overflow

   Detailed Bug Description
   ------------------------

   [01 - Yahoo Octal-Encoding Decoder Overflow]
   [02 - Yahoo Octal-Encoding Decoder Out-Of-Bounds Overflow]

   When the Yahoo Messenger handler decodes an octal value for
   email notification functions 2 different kind of overflows
   can be triggered

   Affected version: 0.75 (only)
   File:             gaim/src/protocols/yahoo/yahoo.c
   Function:         yahoo_decode()
   Code:

      static char *yahoo_decode(const char *text)
      {
         char *converted;
         char *p, *n, *new;

         n = new = g_malloc(strlen (text) + 1);

         for (p = (char *)text; *p; p++, n++) {
            if (*p == '\\') {
               sscanf(p + 1, "%3o\n", (int *)n); <-------- [[01]](#01)
               p += 3;  <--------------------------------- [[02]](#02)
            }
            else
               *n = *p;
         }

         *n = '\0';
         ...

   The way sscanf is used, it will always write 4 bytes to the
   allocated buffer. The author did not see the possibility of
   malformed input like "\1" (the backslash is only a backslash) it
   is possible to write 1-2 zero bytes over the buffer boundaries.
   On linux this is exploitable like any heap off by one into the
   malloc() chunks. The second vulnerability is that no matter how
   many bytes sscanf() consumes it always increases the pointer
   with assumed 4 bytes. This can result in overjumping the
   terminating zero byte and with special prepared memory after
   the string it is possible to overwrite the heap with an
   arbitrary amount of bytes.

   These bugs are counted as 2 because for most people [[02]](#02) is not
   obvious. As an example the vendor fixed only [[01]](#01) first, because
   my description was not good enough. Additionally the misuse of
   sscanf() caused an incompatibility to all big endian platforms.

   [03 - Yahoo Web Cookie Parser Overflow]

   When parsing the cookies within the HTTP reply header of a
   yahoo web connection a bufferoverflow can happen.

   Affected version: <= 0.75
   File:             gaim/src/protocols/yahoo/yahoo.c
   Function:         yahoo_web_pending()
   Code:

      void yahoo_web_pending(gpointer data, gint source, ...
      {
         GaimConnection *gc = data;
         GaimAccount *account = gaim_connection_get_account(gc);
         struct yahoo_data *yd = gc->proto_data;
         char buf[1024], buf2[256], *i = buf, *r = buf2;
         int len, o = 0;

         len = read(source, buf, sizeof(buf));
         ...
         while ((i = strstr(i, "Set-Cookie: ")) && 0 < 2) {
            i += strlen("Set-Cookie: ");
            for (;*i != ';'; r++, i++) {
               *r = *i;
            }
            *r=';';
            r++;
            ...
         }
         ...

   Here all cookie data contained in the first 1024 byte of a
   HTTP reply header is copied into a 256 byte buffer without
   a size check. Because source and destination buffer are
   both on the stack and stack layout will most probably
   result in the smaller buffer overflowing into the smaller
   one this bug is believed to be not exploitable with the
   normal stack layout. Note also the typo in the while()
   condition 0 < 2 which should be o < 2

   [04 - Yahoo Login Page Name Parser Overflow]
   [05 - Yahoo Login Page Value Parser Overflow]

   When parsing the Yahoo Login Webpage the YMSG protocol overflows
   stachbuffers if the webpage returns oversized values.

   Affected version: <= 0.75
   File:             gaim/src/protocols/yahoo/yahoo.c
   Function:         yahoo_login_page_hash()
   Code:

      static
      GHashTable *yahoo_login_page_hash(const char *buf,size_t len)
      {
         GHashTable *hash = g_hash_table_new_full(g_str_hash, g_s...
         const char *c = buf;
         char *d;
         char name[[64]](#64), value[[64]](#64);
         while ((c < (buf + len)) && (c = strstr(c, "<input "))) {
            c = strstr(c, "name=\"") + strlen("name=\"");
            for (d = name; *c!='"'; c++, d++) <----------- [[04]](#04)
               *d = *c;                       <---------/
            *d = '\0';
            d = strstr(c, "value=\"") + strlen("value=\"");
            if (strchr(c, '>') < d)
               break;
            for (c = d, d = value; *c!='"'; c++, d++) <--- [[05]](#05)
               *d = *c;   <-----------------------------/
            *d = '\0';
            g_hash_table_insert(hash, g_strdup(name), g_strdup(value));
         }
         return hash;
      }

   The content of the yahoo login webpage is trusted although it
   could be changed with a simple man-in-the-middle attack on the
   HTTP session. name and value are filled directly from the page
   without any kind of size check. This results in two independent
   ways to overflow the stack.

   [06 - Yahoo Packet Parser Overflow]

   A Yahoo Messenger packet consist of a header and a list of keys
   with their associated values. When reading an oversized keyname
   a standard stackoverflow can be triggered. This is nost probably
   the most dangerous discovered vulnerability because the nature
   of the bug makes it very easy to exploit and additonally a TCP
   man-in-the-middle attack is NOT needed. It is possible to send
   a malicious YMSG packet to the yahoo server so that it will
   be forwarded like any normal message.

   Affected version: <= 0.75
   File:             gaim/src/protocols/yahoo/yahoo.c
   Function:         yahoo_packet_read()
   Code:

      static void yahoo_packet_read(struct yahoo_packet *pkt,
                                              guchar *data, int len)
      {
         int pos = 0;

         while (pos + 1 < len) {
            char key[[64]](#64), *value = NULL, *esc;
            int accept;
            int x;

            struct yahoo_pair *pair = g_new0(struct yahoo_pair, 1);

            x = 0;
            while (pos + 1 < len) {
               if (data[pos] == 0xc0 && data[pos + 1] == 0x80)
               break;
               key[x++] = data[pos++];  <----------------- [[06]](#06)
            }
            key[x] = 0;
            pos += 2;
            ...

   Everytime the YMSG handler receives a complete packet it will
   give it this function to split it into its keys and values.
   Because the keyname is copied without any kind of size check
   into the key variable which is a 64 byte stackbuffer it is very
   easy to exploit.
   NOTE: This bug is also exploitable on systems with non executable
   stacks, or stack overflow detections as long free() exploits are
   possible on that platform,

   [07 - AIM/Oscar DirectIM Integer Overflow]

   Integer Overflow when allocating memory for a directIM packet
   results in heap overflow. directIM is a client 2 client protocol
   and therefore does not require a mim.

   Affected version: <= 0.74
   File:             gaim/src/protocols/oscar/ft.c
   Function:         handlehdr_odc()
   Code:

      static int handlehdr_odc(aim_session_t *sess, aim_...
      {
         aim_frame_t fr;
         int ret = 0;
         aim_rxcallback_t userfunc;
         fu32_t payloadlength;
         fu16_t flags, encoding;
         char *snptr = NULL;

         fr.conn = conn;

         /* AAA - ugly */
         aim_bstream_setpos(bs, 20);
         payloadlength = aimbs_get32(bs);

         ...

         if (payloadlength) {
            char *msg;
            ...

            if (!(msg = calloc(1, payloadlength+1))) {  <--- [[07]](#07)
               free(snptr);
               return -ENOMEM;
            }

            while (payloadlength - recvd) {
               if (payloadlength - recvd >= 1024)
                  i = aim_recv(conn->fd, &msg[recvd], 1024);
               else
      ...

   Within this code snipset payloadlength is taken directly from the
   network and passed to the calloc() function in an unsafe manner.

   A user supplied payloadlength of UINT_MAX (0xffffffff) will cause
   an integer overflow within the second parameter of calloc() and
   therefore only allocate a 0 byte buffer. Please notice that this
   bug is not an integer overflow due to the multiplication within
   calloc() and therefore it is not catched by the recent security
   patches to calloc() on different platforms. Please also note that
   calloc(1, 0) will not return a NULL pointer but a pointer into
   the legal heap on at least all tested platforms (f.e. linux, bsd)
   On BSD systems this is configureable but it defaults to this
   behaviour. After allocating the 0 byte buffer aim_recv() is called
   repeatedly by the while loop to read and overwrite with up to 4GB
   of data.

   [08 - Quoted Printable Decoder Overflow]
   [09 - Quoted Printable Decoder Out-Of-Bounds Overflow]

   When the MIME decoder decosed a quoted printable encoded string
   for email notification 2 different kind of overflows can be
   triggered.

   Affected version: 0.75 (only)
   File:             gaim/src/util.c
   Function:         quotedp_decode()
   Code:

      void
      gaim_quotedp_decode(const char *str, char **ret_str, int ...
      {
         char *p, *n, *new;

         n = new = g_malloc(strlen (str) + 1);

         for (p = (char *)str; *p; p++, n++) {
            if (*p == '=') {
               sscanf(p + 1, "%2x\n", (int *)n); <-------- [[08]](#08)
               p += 2;  <--------------------------------- [[09]](#09)
            }
            else if (*p == '_')
                    *n = ' ';
                 else
                    *n = *p;
        }

        *n = '\0';
        ...

   Because these bugs are very similar to [[01]](#01) and [[02]](#02) only the
   vulnerable code snipset is shown here. For an explanation read
   the yahoo_decode() vulnerability description.

   [10 - URL Parser Function Overflow]

   At various placed this utility function is used to split an
   url into its parts. Because temporary fixed size stackbuffers
   are used in an unsafe way a standard stackoverflow can be
   caused.

   Affected version: <= 0.75
   File:             gaim/src/util.c
   Function:         gaim_url_parse()
   Code:

      gboolean
      gaim_url_parse(const char *url, char **ret_host,
                      int *ret_port, char **ret_path)
      {
         char scan_info[255];
         char port_str[[5]](#5);
         int f;
         const char *turl;
         char host[256], path[256];
         int port = 0;
         /* hyphen at end includes it in control set */
         static char addr_ctrl[] = "A-Za-z0-9.-";
         static char port_ctrl[] = "0-9";
         static char page_ctrl[] = "A-Za-z0-9.~_/:*!@&%%?=+^-";

         ...
         g_snprintf(scan_info, sizeof(scan_info),
                       "%%[%s]:%%[%s]/%%[%s]", addr_ctrl,
                       port_ctrl, page_ct

         f = sscanf(url, scan_info, host, port_str, path); <-- [[10]](#10)
         ...

   Here sscanf() is again used in an unsafe manner. When this
   function is called with an oversized url, which can be triggered
   from several protocol handlers in different ways sscanf() will
   overwrite the stackbuffers host and path. The problem at this
   point is, that it is only possible to overwrite the buffers with
   a limited characterset which makes exploitation tricky.

   [11 - Extract Info Field Function Overflow]

   At various places this utility function is called to copy the
   data between 2 tokens into a fixed size stackbuffer without a
   size check.

   Affected version: <= 0.74
   File:             gaim/src/util.c
   Function:         gaim_markup_extract_info_field()
   Code:

      ...
      const char *p, *q;
      char buf[1024];

      ...
      p = strstr(str, start_token);
      ...
      p += strlen(start_token) + skip;
      ...
      q = strstr(p, end_token);

      if (q != NULL && (!no_value_token ||
               (no_value_token && strncmp(p, no_value

      {
         ...
         if (is_link)
         {
            strcat(dest_buffer, "<br><a href=\"");
            memcpy(buf, p, q - p); <---------------------- [[11]](#11)
            buf[q - p] = '\0';
            ...

   Here it is obvious that if q - p is bigger than 1024 bytes
   memcpy() will overwrite the stack which will result in a
   standard stack overflow. At the moment this routine is
   called from within the get_user_info functions of the MSN
   and YMSG protocol handlers.

   [12 - HTTP Proxy Connect Overflow]

   When Gaim is setup to use a HTTP proxy for connecting to the
   server a malicious HTTP proxy can exploit it.

   Affected version: <= 0.75
   File:             gaim/src/proxy.c
   Function:         http_canread()
   Code:

      static void
      http_canread(gpointer data, gint source, GaimInputCondit...
      {
         int nlc = 0;
         int pos = 0;
         int minor, major, status, error=0;
         struct PHB *phb = data;
         char inputline[8192], *p;

         gaim_input_remove(phb->inpa);

         while ((nlc != 2) &&
                (read(source, &inputline[pos++], 1) == 1)) {
            if (inputline[pos - 1] == '\n')
               nlc++;
            else if (inputline[pos - 1] != '\r')
                    nlc = 0;
        }
        inputline[pos] = '\0';
        ...

   Here the author never thought about the possibility that a
   proxy server could be malicious. The inputline is read into
   the 8192 byte buffer byte after byte until a double \r\n is
   found. Because there is no size check at all the buffer will
   overflow as soon the proxy sends more than 8192 bytes in a
   line. This bug is exploitable even if stack overwrite
   protections are in place because it is possible to overwrite
   the pointer phb which points to a struct that contains a
   callback function which is later called in the function.
   By overwriting the pointer and so controlling the callback
   function pointer it is possible to gain control over the
   instruction pointer before the function is left.

Proof of Concept:

   e-matters is not going to release exploit for any of the these
   vulnerability to the public.

      [07 - AIM/Oscar DirectIM Integer Overflow]

Disclosure Timeline:

   04. January 2004 - The Oscar filetransfer bug was sent to the
                      Gaim vendor by email. Within an hour the bug
                      was fixed within the CVS
   10. January 2004 - Gaim vendor released version 0.75 because of
                      a Yahoo protocol change problem(?)
                      Some freetime allowed deeper analysis of the
                      new version. This revealed more bugs: 1 fixed
                      in 0.75, some new in 0.75 and some old which
                      are still in 0.75. All these bugs were again
                      mailed to the vendor
   15. January 2004 - Vendor was contacted with a patch because
                      they had not fixed the bugs yet. Our Patch
                      was applied in the same night
   16. January 2004 - Vendor-sec was contacted to coordinate the
                      disclosure process. Vendor was asked by email
                      when 0.76 is about to come out and that this
                      should be as soon as possible because the
                      bugfixes were visible in their CVS with
                      explicit commit messaged. No response to this
                      mail until today
   23. January 2004 - Vendor was notified about public disclosure
                      at the 26th.
   25. January 2004 - Notification by the vendor that gaim 0.76
                      releasedate is not planned yet.
   26. January 2004 - Public Disclosure

Recommendation:

   Because there is no official new version out yet, you can download
   a diff against version 0.75 from

   <http://security.e-matters.de/patches/gaim-0.75-fix.diff>

   This patch was done by the FreeBSD security team. It is different
   from the official patches in the Gaim CVS. We suggest that you
   upgrade as soon as possible, because the explicit commit message
   into the official CVS tree seems to have leaked. At least it was
   reported to us that a link to the message on the sourceforge
   WebCVS was pasted into an IRC channel.

#### Vulnerability Note VU#226974

Original Release Date: 2004-04-30 | Last Revised: 2004-05-06

---

### Overview

There is an off-by-one buffer overflow vulnerability in the Gaim MIME decoder.

### Description

| [Gaim](http://gaim.sourceforge.net/) is a multi-protocol instant messenger available for a number of operating systems. It includes a feature that requires Gaim to decode MIME-encoded data. There is an off-by-one buffer overflow vulnerability in the gaim\_quotedp\_decode() function. This function fails to properly decode quoted printable strings used for email notification functions. By supplying a specially crafted quoted printable string, an unauthenticated, remote attacker may be able to cause a null byte to be overwritten. |
