- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `dtmail` program in Sun Solaris improperly handles command-line arguments. Specifically, a format string specifier in the `argv[0]` value can be exploited.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Format string vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `dtmail` process, which is typically group mail. This allows the attacker to read, modify, and delete the email of other users.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by supplying a specially crafted `argv[0]` value containing a format string specifier to the `dtmail` program.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local user account on the vulnerable system.
