How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Fedora Update

This update can be downloaded from:

<http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/updates/1/>

This update can be installed with Yum Update Agent; you can type 'yum update' command in the terminal.

This update can also be installed with the Red Hat Update Agent; you can launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the 'up2date' command in the terminal.

# [SECURITY] Fedora Core 1 Update: kernel-2.4.22-1.2188.nptl

```

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2004-111
2004-04-22
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Name        : kernel
Version     : 2.4.22
Release     : 1.2188.nptl
Summary     : The Linux kernel (the core of the Linux operating system)
Description :
The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of your
Fedora Core Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the basic functions
of the operating system:  memory allocation, process allocation, device
input and output, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

A memory leak was fixed in an error path in the do_fork() routine.
This was unlikely to have caused problems in real world situations.

The information leak fixed in the previous errata was also found
to affect XFS and JFS. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the names
CAN-2004-0133 and CAN-2004-0181 respectively.

A vulnerability in the OSS code for SoundBlaster 16 devices
was discovered by Andreas Kies.  It is possible for local users with
access to the sound system to crash the machine (CAN-2004-0178).

An automated checked from http://www.coverity.com highlighted a
range checking bug in the i810 DRM driver. This was fixed by
Andrea Arcangeli and Chris Wright.

Arjan van de Ven discovered the framebuffer code was doing direct
userspace accesses instead of using correct interfaces to write
to userspace.

Brad Spengler found a signedness issue in the cpufreq proc handler
which could lead to users being able to read arbitary regions of
kernel memory. This was fixed by Dominik Brodowski.

Shaun Colley found a potential buffer overrun in the panic() function.
As this function does not ever return, it is unlikely that this is
exploitable, but has been fixed nonetheless.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the name CAN-2004-0394
to this issue.

Paul Starzetz and Wojciech Purczynski found a lack of bounds
checking in the MCAST_MSFILTER socket option which allows user code
to write into kernel space, potentially giving the attacker full
root priveledges. There has already been proof of concept code published
exploiting this hole in a local denial-of-service manner.
http://www.isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0015-msfilter.txt has more
information. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
assigned the name CAN-2004-0424 to this issue.

The previous security errata actually missed fixes for several important
problems. This has been corrected in this update.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Wed Apr 21 2004 Dave Jones
- Fix memory leak in do_fork() error path
- Really fix CAN-2004-0109 and previous mremap issue.
 These patches were not applied in the previous errata.
- Fix information leak in XFS (CAN-2004-0133)
- Fix potential local denial of service in sb16 driver (CAN-2004-0178)
- Fix information leak in JFS (CAN-2004-0181)
- Add range checking to i810_dma() in DRM driver.
- Make ioctl(FBIOGETCMAP) use copy_to_user() rather than memcpy()
- Fix information leak in cpufreq userspace ioctl. (CAN-2004-0228)
- Fix possible buffer overflow in panic() (CAN-2004-0394)
- Fix setsockopt MCAST_MSFILTER integer overflow. (CAN-2004-0424)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Background

The Linux kernel is responsible for managing the core aspects of a
GNU/Linux system, providing an interface for core system applications
as well as providing the essential structure and capability to access
hardware that is needed for a running system.

### Description

Multiple flaws have been discovered in the Linux kernel. This advisory
corrects the following issues:

* CAN-2004-0109: This vulnerability allows privilege escalation using
  ISO9660 file systems through a buffer overflow via a malformed file
  system containing a long symbolic link entry. This can allow arbitrary
  code execution at kernel level.
* CAN-2004-0133: The XFS file system in 2.4 series kernels has an
  information leak by which data in the memory can be written to the
  device hosting the file system, allowing users to obtain portions of
  kernel memory by reading the raw block device.
* CAN-2004-0177: The ext3 file system in 2.4 series kernels does not
  properly initialize journal descriptor blocks, causing an information
  leak by which data in the memory can be written to the device hosting
  the file system, allowing users to obtain portions of kernel memory by
  reading the raw device.
* CAN-2004-0181: The JFS file system in 2.4 series kernels has an
  information leak by which data in the memory can be written to the
  device hosting the file system, allowing users to obtain portions of
  kernel memory by reading the raw device.
* CAN-2004-0178: The OSS Sound Blaster [R] Driver has a Denial of Service
  vulnerability since it does not handle certain sample sizes properly.
  This allows local users to hang the kernel.
* CAN-2004-0228: Due to an integer signedness error in the CPUFreq /proc
  handler code in 2.6 series Linux kernels, local users can escalate
  their privileges.
* CAN-2004-0229: The framebuffer driver in 2.6 series kernel drivers does
  not use the fb\_copy\_cmap method of copying structures. The impact of
  this issue is unknown, however.
* CAN-2004-0394: A buffer overflow in the panic() function of 2.4 series
  Linux kernels exists, but it may not be exploitable under normal
  circumstances due to its functionality.
* CAN-2004-0427: The do\_fork() function in both 2.4 and 2.6 series Linux
  kernels does not properly decrement the mm\_count counter when an error
  occurs, triggering a memory leak that allows local users to cause a
  Denial of Service by exhausting other applications of memory; causing
  the kernel to panic or to kill services.
* CAN-2004-0495: Multiple vulnerabilities found by the Sparse source
  checker in the kernel allow local users to escalate their privileges or
  gain access to kernel memory.
* CAN-2004-0535: The e1000 NIC driver does not properly initialize memory
  structures before using them, allowing users to read kernel memory.
* CAN-2004-0554: 2.4 and 2.6 series kernels running on an x86 or an AMD64
  architecture allow local users to cause a Denial of Service by a total
  system hang, due to an infinite loop that triggers a signal handler
  with a certain sequence of fsave and frstor instructions.
* Local DoS in PaX: If ASLR is enabled as a GRSecurity PaX feature, a
  Denial of Service can be achieved by putting the kernel into an
  infinite loop. Only 2.6 series GRSecurity kernels are affected by this
  issue.
* RSBAC 1.2.3 JAIL issues: A flaw in the RSBAC JAIL implementation allows
  suid/sgid files to be created inside the jail since the relevant module
  does not check the corresponding mode values. This can allow privilege
  escalation inside the jail. Only rsbac-(dev-)sources are affected by
  this issue.

### Impact

Arbitrary code with normal non-super-user privileges may be able to
exploit any of these vulnerabilities; gaining kernel level access to
memory structures and hardware devices. This may be used for further
exploitation of the system, to leak sensitive data or to cause a Denial
of Service on the affected kernel.

### Workaround

Although users may not be affected by certain vulnerabilities, all
kernels are affected by the CAN-2004-0394, CAN-2004-0427 and
CAN-2004-0554 issues which have no workaround. As a result, all users
are urged to upgrade their kernels to patched versions.

### Resolution

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest available sources for
their system:

```
 # emerge sync
 # emerge -pv your-favorite-sources
 # emerge your-favorite-sources

 # # Follow usual procedure for compiling and installing a kernel.
 # # If you use genkernel, run genkernel as you would do normally.
```
