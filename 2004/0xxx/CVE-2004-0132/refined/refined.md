- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple PHP scripts within ezContents are vulnerable to PHP code injection due to the use of user-controlled variables in `include()` calls. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs because the application does not properly sanitize or validate the `GLOBALS` array when including files via URLs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** PHP code injection, Unvalidated input, remote file inclusion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** HTTP requests with crafted URL parameters that set values in the `GLOBALS` array.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable ezContents installation and have a remote server to host the malicious PHP code to be included. The server must have `register_globals` set to "On" and URL fopen wrappers enabled.
