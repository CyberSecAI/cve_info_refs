SquirrelMail latest version (although is tested on version 1.4.2) is prone to many \
cross scripting attacks that can be used to steal user cookies.The Exploit lies in \
the way squirrel mail represents the folder names and shows them.To make the matters \
worse.No extra unique variable added to the url for each user therefore it is easy \
for the attacker to just pass the url in mail and steal the session cookie.

Some of the exploit are at :

<http://victim.com/mail/src/compose.php?mailbox=INBOX>

which can be replaced as follows

<http://victim.com/mail/src/compose.php?mailbox=>">&lt;script&gt;malacious \
script&lt;/script&gt;

Example:

<http://victim.com/mail/src/compose.php?mailbox=>">&lt;script&gt;window.alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Squirrel Mail Coders have been informed of this vulnerability but the vulnerability \
still exists in their latest version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please Let me know if i am wrong anywhere...

Regards,
Alvin

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

# Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities in SquirrelMail — GLSA **200405-16**

SquirrelMail is subject to several XSS and one SQL injection vulnerability.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/squirrelmail** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.3\_rc1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.3\_rc1** |

### Background

SquirrelMail is a webmail package written in PHP. It supports IMAP and
SMTP, and can optionally be installed with SQL support.

### Description

Several unspecified cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities and a
well hidden SQL injection vulnerability were found. An XSS attack
allows an attacker to insert malicious code into a web-based
application. SquirrelMail does not check for code when parsing
variables received via the URL query string.

### Impact

One of the XSS vulnerabilities could be exploited by an attacker to
steal cookie-based authentication credentials from the user's browser.
The SQL injection issue could potentially be used by an attacker to run
arbitrary SQL commands inside the SquirrelMail database with privileges
of the SquirrelMail database user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are advised to
upgrade to version 1.4.3\_rc1 or higher of SquirrelMail.

### Resolution

All SquirrelMail users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=mail-client/squirrelmail-1.4.3_rc1"
 # emerge ">=mail-client/squirrelmail-1.4.3_rc1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# RHSA-2004:240 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

squirrelmail security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An updated SquirrelMail package that fixes several security vulnerabilities
is now available.

## Description

SquirrelMail is a webmail package written in PHP. Multiple
vulnerabilities have been found which affect the version of SquirrelMail
shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

An SQL injection flaw was found in SquirrelMail version 1.4.2 and earlier.
If SquirrelMail is configured to store user addressbooks in the database, a
remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary SQL statements.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0521 to this issue.

A number of cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws in SquirrelMail version 1.4.2
and earlier could allow remote attackers to execute script as other web
users. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CAN-2004-0519 and CAN-2004-0520 to these issues.

All users of SquirrelMail are advised to upgrade to the erratum package
containing SquirrelMail version 1.4.3a which is not vulnerable to these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade. Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated. Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated. Note that you
can also use wildcards (\*.rpm) if your current directory \*only\* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network. Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
