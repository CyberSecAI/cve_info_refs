{
  "CVE-2004-0938": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Undisclosed defects in the way FreeRADIUS handles incorrect received packets.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "The function which decodes RADIUS attributes into data structures did not properly check for malformed USR vendor-specific attributes.  It could be convinced to call memcpy with a length value of \"-1\", interpreted as 0xffffffff, leading to an infinite copy and core dump.",
      "The function which decodes RADIUS attributes did not properly check for certain pre-conditions before decoding Ascend-Send-Secret and Ascend-Recv-Secret attributes.  It could be convinced to call a function with a NULL pointer, leading to a dereference and core dump.",
      "The function which decodes RADIUS attributes did not properly clean up after itself if the Ascend-Send-Secret, Ascend-Recv-Secret, or Tunnel-Password attributes were received in an Access-Request packet. This resulted in a memory leak of approximately 300 bytes for every Access-Request packet containing these attributes, potentially leading to process termination due to out-of-memory."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can send specially-crafted packets to the FreeRADIUS server causing a denial-of-service by crashing the server.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attacker sends specially crafted RADIUS packets to the vulnerable server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the FreeRADIUS server."
