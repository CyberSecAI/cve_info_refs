# Apache HTTP Server 2.0 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.0. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 2.0 has had no new releases since 2013 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before August 2013. Subsequent issues may have affected 2.0 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.0.65

### moderate: apr\_fnmatch flaw leads to mod\_autoindex remote DoS ([CVE-2011-0419](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0419))

A flaw was found in the apr\_fnmatch() function of the bundled APR library. Where mod\_autoindex is enabled, and a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

Workaround: Setting the 'IgnoreClient' option to the 'IndexOptions' directive disables processing of the client-supplied request query arguments, preventing this attack.

Resolution: Update APR to release 1.4.5 (bundled with httpd 2.2.19) or release 0.9.20 (bundled with httpd 2.0.65)

### moderate: mod\_proxy reverse proxy exposure ([CVE-2011-3368](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3368))

An exposure was found when using mod\_proxy in reverse proxy mode. In certain configurations using RewriteRule with proxy flag or ProxyPassMatch, a remote attacker could cause the reverse proxy to connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing sensitive information from internal web servers not directly accessible to attacker. No update of 1.3 will be released.

Patches will be published to https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply\_to\_1.3.42/

### low: APR apr\_palloc heap overflow ([CVE-2009-2412](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2412))

A flaw in apr\_palloc() in the bundled copy of APR could cause heap overflows in programs that try to apr\_palloc() a user controlled size. The Apache HTTP Server itself does not pass unsanitized user-provided sizes to this function, so it could only be triggered through some other application which uses apr\_palloc() in a vulnerable way.

### low: expat DoS ([CVE-2009-3720](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-3720))

A buffer over-read flaw was found in the bundled expat library. An attacker who is able to get Apache to parse an untrused XML document (for example through mod\_dav) may be able to cause a crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM.

### important: mod\_isapi module unload flaw ([CVE-2010-0425](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0425))

A flaw was found with within mod\_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod\_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Brett Gervasoni of Sense of Security for reporting and proposing a patch fix for this issue.

### low: Subrequest handling of request headers (mod\_headers) ([CVE-2010-0434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0434))

A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy of the headers\_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod\_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

### low: mod\_cache and mod\_dav DoS ([CVE-2010-1452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1452))

A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod\_cache (2.2) and mod\_dav (2.0 and 2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM. This issue is further mitigated as mod\_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod\_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers" directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

OpenPKG Security Advisory                            The OpenPKG Project
<http://www.openpkg.org/security.html>              <http://www.openpkg.org>
openpkg-security@openpkg.org                         openpkg@openpkg.org
OpenPKG-SA-2004.044                                          15-Oct-2004
________________________________________________________________________

Package:             apache (option "with_mod_ssl yes" only)
Vulnerability:       information disclosure
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:        Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= apache-1.3.31-20041005 >= apache-1.3.31-20041015
OpenPKG 2.1          <= apache-1.3.31-2.1.4    >= apache-1.3.31-2.1.5
OpenPKG 2.0          <= apache-1.3.29-2.0.5    >= apache-1.3.29-2.0.6

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Hartmut Keil discovered [[0]](#0) an information disclosure vulnerability
  in mod_ssl [[1]](#1), the SSL/TLS module of the Apache [[2]](#2) webserver. After
  a renegotiation, affected versions of mod_ssl fail to ensure that the
  requested cipher suite is actually negotiated. In some configurations
  a client may be able to retrieve content using a cipher suite the
  server does not consider strong enough. The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2004-0885 [[3]](#3) to the
  problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  apache" and "<prefix>/bin/rpm -qi apache | grep with_mod_ssl". If you
  have the "apache" package with option "with_mod_ssl" installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade (see Solution) [4][[5]](#5).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [6][[7]](#7), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [8][[9]](#9) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[10]](#10), build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [[4]](#4) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary
  RPM [[5]](#5). For the current release OpenPKG 2.1, perform the following
  operations to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases
  adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.1/UPD
  ftp> get apache-1.3.31-2.1.5.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig apache-1.3.31-2.1.5.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild apache-1.3.31-2.1.5.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/apache-1.3.31-2.1.5.*.rpm

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=31505#c0)  keilh    2004-10-01 14:30:11 UTC  ``` Overview:   For a location a ssl ciphersuite is configured, let's say "DES-CBC3-SHA". And that ciphersuite is not contained in the ciphersuites configured for  the server or virtual host, lets say "RC4-MD5:DES-CBC3-SHA". If that location will be accessed a renegotiation is triggered in  ssl_engine_kernel.c line 283 ff about the changed ciphersuite.  But if the client wants to resume the previous session the server i.e  will accept that. That means a reduced handshake will be made, and the  current cipher remains unchanged! From a openssl point of view it is correct, because openssl can not know the reason for that renegotiation. (see also the ssl spec.) But aware of that in openssl 0.9.7 a new flag SSL_OP_NO_SESSION_RESUMPTION_ON_RENEGOTIATION has been introduced.  Steps to reproduce:  o setup a apache as descriped above:   ssl caching enabled, and for example RC4-MD5,DES-CBC3-SHA   configured for the virtual host, and DES-CBC3-SHA configured   for the '/' location o connect with a java client using JSSE 1.4 o in the error_log can be seen that there is still the initial   cipher RC4-MD5 used after the renegotiation. (a ssldump is attached bellow)  That scenario has been tested with different non-java clients (MSIE, Mozilla). The described problem does not arise, because  these client are not trying to resume during the renegotiation.

Since this is a security issue, it has been assigned CVE name CAN-2004-0885 for tracking purposes. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=31505#c2)  Joe Orton    2004-10-08 11:51:19 UTC  ``` OK, this patch is not of course sufficient to fix the security issue since it only enforces the correct behaviour with OpenSSL 0.9.7.  To actually prevent access with both 0.9.7 and 0.9.6, it's necessary to enhance SSL_hook_Access to really check that the correct cipher suite has been negotiated. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=31505#c3)  keilh    2004-10-08 12:42:01 UTC  ``` To make it working also with OpenSSL 0.9.6 you have to use SSL_CTX_set_session_id_context(..) for disabling a sucessfull  cache lookup. But I would skipp supporting OpenSSL 0.9.6 for that special case, and just add the mentioned cipher check. That check would trigger  for OpenSSL 0.9.6 and we have a clear situation.  ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=31505#c4)  Joe Orton    2004-10-08 12:49:36 UTC  ``` This is what I committed:  <http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/modules/ssl/ssl_engine_kernel.c?r1=1.110&r2=1.111> <http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/modules/ssl/ssl_engine_init.c?r1=1.128&r2=1.129>  so now with 0.9.6 you'll simply get a 403 if you try and access a differently-ciphersuite-protected resource with a client which tries to resume a session during the renegotiation, and the ciphersuite in the resumed session is not sufficient.  With 0.9.7 even with such a client, you shouldn't hit the check since OpenSSL will refuse to resume the session.  This should have all bases covered, have I missed anything? ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=31505#c5)  Joe Orton    2004-10-13 09:46:50 UTC  ``` Proposed for backport for the next 2.0 release.  For reference for those looking for an equivalent mod_ssl 2.8 patch:  <http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-modssl&m=109724918128044&q=raw> ``` |  |

# USN-177-1: Apache 2 vulnerabilities

7 September 2005

Apache 2 vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)
* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

Apache did not honour the "SSLVerifyClient require" directive within a

 block if the surrounding  block contained a

directive "SSLVerifyClient optional". This allowed clients to bypass

client certificate validation on servers with the above configuration.

(CAN-2005-2700)

Filip Sneppe discovered a Denial of Service vulnerability in the byte

range filter handler. By requesting certain large byte ranges, a

remote attacker could cause memory exhaustion in the server.

(CAN-2005-2728)

The updated libapache-mod-ssl also fixes two older Denial of Service

vulnerabilities: A format string error in the ssl\_log() function which

could be exploited to crash the server (CAN-2004-0700), and a flaw in

the SSL cipher negotiation which could be exploited to terminate a

session (CAN-2004-0885). Please note that Apache 1.3 and

libapache-mod-ssl are not officially supported (they are in the
