  "CVE-2004-0885": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The mod_ssl module in Apache 2.0, when configured to use the \"SSLCipherSuite\" directive in directory or location context, allows a client to access the location using any cipher suite allowed by the virtual host configuration, bypassing the specific cipher suites configured for that location.",
    "details": "A vulnerability exists in the mod_ssl module of Apache HTTP Server. When a specific set of cipher suites is required for a particular location using the 'SSLCipherSuite' directive, a client can still access that location using any cipher suite allowed by the virtual host configuration. This bypass occurs due to a failure to properly enforce cipher suite restrictions during SSL renegotiation, allowing a client to bypass the stronger cipher requirements configured for a specific location and potentially downgrade the connection's security.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper enforcement of 'SSLCipherSuite' directive during SSL renegotiation",
      "Bypass of location-specific cipher suite restrictions"
    ],
    "impact": "A client might be able to connect to a specific location using a weaker cipher suite than intended, potentially exposing the communication to eavesdropping or other attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation by initiating a connection with a weaker cipher suite than specified for the location.",
       "Exploitation through attempting to resume an existing session after a renegotiation"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to initiate an SSL/TLS connection to the affected server",
      "Knowledge of the cipher suites supported by the server and the virtual host.",
      "Ability to perform an SSL/TLS renegotiation"
    ],
