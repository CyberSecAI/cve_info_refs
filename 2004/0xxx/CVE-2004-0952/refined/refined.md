Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-0952:

*   **Vulnerability:** HP Ignite-UX filesystem permissions issue.

*   **Root Cause:** When the `add_new_client` command is used in HP Ignite-UX, sections of the TFTP server tree can be made world-writeable. This allows unauthenticated write access to the host filesystem.

*   **Affected versions:** HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.11, B.11.22, and B.11.23 running Ignite-UX prior to version C.6.2.241.

*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can exploit the unsafe file permissions via TFTP.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Unauthorized Access:** An unauthorized user can access and alter Ignite-UX client data on the Ignite-UX server.
    *   **DoS:** An attacker can launch a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by exhausting disk space through filling the local filesystem.
    *   Attackers can move data/tools into and out of the host.

*   **Mitigation:** Apply the HP Ignite-UX version C.6.2.241 patches or disable the TFTP server.
