# USN-177-1: Apache 2 vulnerabilities

7 September 2005

Apache 2 vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)
* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

Apache did not honour the "SSLVerifyClient require" directive within a

 block if the surrounding  block contained a

directive "SSLVerifyClient optional". This allowed clients to bypass

client certificate validation on servers with the above configuration.

(CAN-2005-2700)

Filip Sneppe discovered a Denial of Service vulnerability in the byte

range filter handler. By requesting certain large byte ranges, a

remote attacker could cause memory exhaustion in the server.

(CAN-2005-2728)

The updated libapache-mod-ssl also fixes two older Denial of Service

vulnerabilities: A format string error in the ssl\_log() function which

could be exploited to crash the server (CAN-2004-0700), and a flaw in

the SSL cipher negotiation which could be exploited to terminate a

session (CAN-2004-0885). Please note that Apache 1.3 and

libapache-mod-ssl are not officially supported (they are in the

"universe" component of the Ubuntu archive).

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 5.04

* apache2-mpm-worker
  -
* apache2-mpm-perchild
  -
* apache2-mpm-prefork
  -
* apache2-mpm-threadpool
  -
* libapache-mod-ssl
  -

##### Ubuntu 4.10

* apache2-mpm-worker
  -
* apache2-mpm-perchild
  -
* apache2-mpm-prefork
  -
* apache2-mpm-threadpool
  -
* libapache-mod-ssl
  -

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

## mod\_ssl contains a format string vulnerability in the ssl\_log() function

#### Vulnerability Note VU#303448

Original Release Date: 2004-07-19 | Last Revised: 2004-07-19

---

### Overview

There is a format string vulnerability in the ssl\_log() function of the mod\_ssl module that could allow an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| [mod\_ssl](http://www.modssl.org/) is an [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) module that provides [Secure Sockets Layer](http://www.netscape.com/eng/ssl3/) (SSL v2/v3) and [Transport Layer Security](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt) (TLS v1) protocol support. There is a format string vulnerability in way the ssl\_log() function of the mod\_ssl module handles hostnames. By supplying a specially crafted hostname value in an HTTPS request, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could trigger this vulnerability. Please note, the hostname provided would have to exist in the zone. |

### Impact

### Solution
