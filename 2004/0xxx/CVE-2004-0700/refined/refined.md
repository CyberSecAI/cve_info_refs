Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details related to CVE-2004-0700:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A format string vulnerability exists within the `ssl_log()` function of the `mod_ssl` module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The `ssl_log()` function improperly handles hostnames, allowing for the injection of format string specifiers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Denial of Service:**  The Ubuntu notice also mentions this CVE as part of a larger update that addresses a DoS vulnerability by exploiting a format string error in `ssl_log()`, resulting in a server crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring authentication.
- **Crafted Hostname:**  The attacker needs to supply a specially crafted hostname value within an HTTPS request.  The crafted hostname must exist in the zone.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTPS requests to a vulnerable server.
- They must be able to control the hostname value within the request to inject format string specifiers.
