How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I am using this on a headless machine, so I was only able to test tethereal and not use it under X. I can try X later when I use a different machine.  # /usr/bin/tethereal -v tethereal 0.10.4 Compiled with GLib 1.2.10, with libpcap 0.8.3, with libz 1.1.4, with libpcre 4.4, without UCD-SNMP or Net-SNMP, without ADNS.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=124534#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2004-05-27 10:42:47 UTC  ``` Issues have been discovered in the following protocol dissectors:      * A SIP packet could make Ethereal crash under specific conditions, as described in the following message:       <http://www.ethereal.com/lists/ethereal-users/200405/msg00018.html>       (0.10.3).     * The AIM dissector could throw an assertion, causing Ethereal to terminate abnormally (0.10.3).     * It was possible for the SPNEGO dissector to dereference a null pointer, causing a crash (0.9.8 to 0.10.3).     * The MMSE dissector was susceptible to a buffer overflow. (0.10.1 to 0.10.3).           Affects: 2.1AS 2.1AW 2.1ES 2.1WS         Affects: 3AS 3WS 3ES 3Desktop  Note that a number of crashes have been reported in 0.10.4 on ethereal-users therefore suggest a backport of these fixes to 0.10.3  Note date on ethereal advisory states "March 22nd" but this is incorrect, it should be "May 13th" (mailed Gerald with correction).  CVE names applied for.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=124534#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2004-06-01 21:26:53 UTC  ``` CAN-2004-0504/5/6/7   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=124534#c2)  Mark J. Cox    2004-06-09 12:50:26 UTC  ```  An errata has been issued which should help the problem  described in this bug report. This report is therefore being  closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

RHSA-2004:234 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2004-06-09
Updated:
2004-06-09
# RHSA-2004:234 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

ethereal security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Updated Ethereal packages that fix various security vulnerabilities are now
available.

## Description

Ethereal is a program for monitoring network traffic.

The MMSE dissector in Ethereal releases 0.10.1 through 0.10.3 contained a
buffer overflow flaw. On a system where Ethereal is running, a remote
attacker could send malicious packets that could cause Ethereal to crash or
execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0507 to this issue.

In addition, other flaws in Ethereal prior to 0.10.4 were found that could
cause it to crash in response to carefully crafted SIP (CAN-2004-0504), AIM
(CAN-2004-0505), or SPNEGO (CAN-2004-0506) packets.

Users of Ethereal should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported security patches that correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Please note that this update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red
Hat Network, launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

# Ethereal: Multiple security problems — GLSA **200406-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities including one buffer overflow exist in Ethereal,
which may allow an attacker to run arbitrary code or crash the program.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/ethereal** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.10.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.10.4** |

### Background

Ethereal is a feature rich network protocol analyzer.

### Description

There are multiple vulnerabilities in versions of Ethereal earlier than
0.10.4, including:

* A buffer overflow in the MMSE dissector.
* Under specific conditions a SIP packet could make Ethereal
  crash.
* The AIM dissector could throw an assertion, causing Ethereal to
  crash.
* The SPNEGO dissector could dereference a null pointer, causing a
  crash.

### Impact

An attacker could use these vulnerabilities to crash Ethereal or even
execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
Ethereal, which could be the root user.

### Workaround

For a temporary workaround you can disable all affected protocol
dissectors by selecting Analyze->Enabled Protocols... and deselecting
them from the list. However, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to
the latest stable release.

### Resolution

All Ethereal users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.10.4"
 # emerge ">=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.10.4"
```
