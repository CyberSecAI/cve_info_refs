- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Input validation vulnerability in the WinGate web server, which serves a Java applet for proxy user authentication. The vulnerability is triggered when the server attempts to retrieve a file from a specified path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The web server does not properly validate the input path, allowing an attacker to bypass the intended root directory and access arbitrary files. The use of extra slashes in the path allows traversal outside of the root directory. Specifically, one extra slash is needed for WinGate 5 and two for WinGate 6.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated remote attackers to retrieve the contents of arbitrary files on the server. Since WinGate runs by default as localsystem, sensitive files like Windows SAM backups can be retrieved. This could lead to a compromise of the system and user credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a malformed HTTP request to the WinGate built-in web server through a URL. The URL specifies the file path using a `wingate-internal` directory followed by a file path containing extra slashes (e.g., `//path` for WinGate 5, `///path` for WinGate 6).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WinGate server, which typically would be on the same local network, but could be exposed to the internet if the proxy is bound to external interfaces. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
