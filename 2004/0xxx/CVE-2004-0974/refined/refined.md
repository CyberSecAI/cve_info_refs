- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `etc2ps.sh` script in Netatalk creates temporary files in world-writable directories with predictable names.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure temporary file handling, specifically the creation of temporary files with predictable names in world-writable directories, makes it susceptible to symlink attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can create symbolic links in the temporary files directory, pointing to arbitrary files on the filesystem. When `etc2ps.sh` is executed, it would overwrite the linked file with the rights of the user running the utility (potentially root), leading to arbitrary file overwrite.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required to create the malicious symlinks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create symlinks in the temporary directory used by `etc2ps.sh`.
