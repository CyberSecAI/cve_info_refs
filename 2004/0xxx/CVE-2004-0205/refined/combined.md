## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**I'm still using Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Service Pack 6a, but extended security update support ended on June 30, 2004. However, this bulletin has a security update for this operating system. Why is that?**

Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Service Pack 6a has reached the end of its life cycles as previously documented, and Microsoft extended this support to June 30, 2004. However, the end-of-life for the extended support period occurred very recently. In this case, the majority of the steps that are required to address this vulnerability were completed before June 30, 2004. Therefore, we have been able to release security updates for these operating system versions as part of this security bulletin. We do not anticipate doing this for future vulnerabilities affecting these operating system versions.

It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to future vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Life Cycle, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these operating system versions, visit the following [Microsoft Product Support Services Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;%5bln%5d;lifeanoct2003).

Customers who require additional support for Windows NT Workstation 4.0 SP6a must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/), select the country, and then click Go to see a list of phone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager.

For more information, see the [Windows Operating System FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;%5bln%5d;lifewinfaq).

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA will determine if this update is required. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**Note** After April 20, 2004, the Mssecure.xml file that is used by MBSA 1.1.1 and earlier versions is no longer being updated with new security bulletin data. Therefore, scans that are performed after that date with MBSA 1.1.1 or earlier will be incomplete. All users should upgrade to MBSA 1.2 because it provides more accurate security update detection and supports additional products. Users can download MBSA 1.2 from the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about MBSA support, visit the following [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer 1.2 Q&A; Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsaqa.mspx).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

  2. Locate the following key in the registry:

     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\w3svc\parameters
  3. Click **Edit**, click **Add Value**, and then add the following registry value:

     + Value Name: MaxClientRequestBuffer Type: REG\_DWORD
  4. In the **DWORD Editor** dialog box, under **Radix**, click **Decimal**.
  5. In the **Data** box, type the number of bytes for the maximum URL request. Set the size so that it is equal to or less than 16384 bytes.

     **Note** You must restart the IIS service for the changes to take effect.

     For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [260694](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;260694)

  **Impact of workaround:** Any incoming request that is larger than 16384 bytes will fail.
* **Stop, disable, or remove IIS**

  + You can stop the World Wide Web Publishing Service component of IIS by issuing the **net stop w3svc** command at a command prompt.
  + You can use the [IIS Manager](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/library/iis/b0c14479-83e3-435d-a935-819fe396e7d2.mspx) to disable or stop IIS.
  + You can stop or disable the World Wide Web Publishing Service by using the Services item in Control Panel.
  + You can use Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel to remove IIS from your system. To find IIS, click **Add/Remove Windows Components**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** If you stop the World Wide Web Publishing Service component of IIS, the system can no longer provide Web content. If you stop or remove IIS, the system can no longer provide Web, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or NTP content. The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) service will also be unavailable.

#### FAQ for IIS Redirection Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0205:

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by an unchecked buffer in the IIS 4.0 redirect function.

**What is a redirect?**

By using the IIS 4.0 redirect function, an administrator can forward incoming requests to another virtual directory or to another server.

**Does the** [**IIS Lockdown Tool**](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;325864) **block this attack?**

Yes. The IISLockdown tool installs URLScan, which can be used to block this attack. You must configure the URLScan tool by following the steps that are described in the Workarounds for IIS Redirection Vulnerability section of this bulletin to block this attack.

**Will the** [**URLScan**](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=12244f33-a5da-4203-a3a8-83f4388bb71f&displaylang;=en) **tool block this attack?**

Yes. You can configure the URLScan tool to block this by following the steps that are described in the Workarounds for IIS Redirection Vulnerability section of this bulletin.

**What is redirection?**

Redirection occurs when a Web browser makes a request for a Web page that does not exist, and the Web server redirects the browser to another page, such as to a generic error page or to the Web site's home page. For example, the Web page <https://www.microsoft.com/xp> does not exist, but instead of providing an error, the Web server redirects the browser to a page that suggests pages that the user may have been looking for and provides a site map. This process is redirection.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could exploit this vulnerability.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 contains a buffer overflow in the redirect function

#### Vulnerability Note VU#717748

Original Release Date: 2004-07-14 | Last Revised: 2004-07-14

---

### Overview

There is a vulnerability in the redirect function of Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.

### Description

| Internet Information Server ([IIS](http://www.microsoft.com/WindowsServer2003/iis/default.mspx)) is a web server available for the Microsoft Windows operating system. IIS provides a redirect function that is responsible for forwarding incoming HTTP requests to another page. There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the way the redirect function validates the length of incoming requests. By sending a specially crafted message to an affected system, an attacker could trigger a buffer overflow and potentially execute code of the attacker's choice. For more information, please refer to Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-021](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-021.mspx).  Note: According to the [Microsoft Security Bulletin](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-021.mspx), only IIS 4.0 systems are affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code on an affected system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-021](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-021.mspx). |
