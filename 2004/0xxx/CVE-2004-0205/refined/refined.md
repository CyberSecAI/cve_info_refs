Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2004-0205:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an unchecked buffer in the IIS 4.0 redirect function. This function is responsible for forwarding incoming HTTP requests to another page.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability occurs because IIS 4.0 does not properly validate the length of incoming requests before passing them to the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:**  The core vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the IIS 4.0 redirect function. This means that if an attacker sends a request that is larger than the buffer allocated to handle it, the excess data will overwrite adjacent memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This means the attacker could gain complete control of the system.
*   **System Compromise:** With complete control, the attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, including the internet.
*   **Specially Crafted Messages:** The attack involves sending a specially crafted HTTP message to the vulnerable server. The message is designed to cause the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send network messages to the affected server.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not need any prior authentication or privileged access.
*   **Technical Skill:**  The attacker needs some technical skill to craft the malicious message that will cause the buffer overflow.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability specifically affects **Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0** running on Windows NT 4.0.
*   IIS versions 5.0, 5.1 and 6.0 are not affected.
*   Disabling permanent redirects would mitigate the vulnerability.
*   URLScan tool can also be used to disallow large requests, which can act as a workaround.
