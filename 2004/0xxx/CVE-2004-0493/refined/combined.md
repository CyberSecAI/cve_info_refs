## DoS in apache httpd 2.0.49, yet still apache much better than windows

Risk:  low for 32 bit systems, unknown for 64 bit systems with more than  4GB virtual memory  Date: 28 June 2004  Legal Notice: This Advisory is Copyright (c) 2004 Georgi Guninski. You  may  not  modify    it   and   distribute    it   or   distribute   parts of it without the author's written permission - this especially  applies  to so called "vulnerabilities databases"  and  securityfocus,  microsoft,    cert and mitre.

Disclaimer: The  information  in  this  advisory  is  believed   to   be   true   though it may be false. The opinions  expressed  in  this  advisory  and  program  are    my  own  and not   of   any     company.    The   usual   standard   disclaimer    applies, especially the fact that Georgi Guninski  is  not  liable  for    any  damages caused by direct  or  indirect    use  of  the  information  or  functionality provided  by  this  advisory  or  program.    Georgi   Guninski   bears   no responsibility for  content  or  misuse  of  this  advisory  or  program  or any derivatives thereof.  Description:  There is denial of service in apache httpd 2.0.49. It is possible to consume arbitrary amount of memory. On 64 bit systems with more than 4GB virtual memory this may lead to heap based buffer overflow whose exploitation is unclear at the moment.   Details: The problem is in server/protocol.c ap\_get\_mime\_headers\_core: ------       if (last\_field != NULL) {             if ((len > 0) && ((\*field == '\t') || \*field == ' ')) { ... fold\_buf = (char \*)apr\_palloc(r->pool, alloc\_len); ----- If header lines starts with TAB or SPACE, apache allocates memory for it.  This allows making arbitrary long header lines.  The following applies to 64 bit systems with a lot of virtual memory if sizeof(long)==8 and sizeof(int)==4.  This code can be hit on line 743:  ap\_escape\_html(r->pool, last\_field), last\_field can be arbitrary long. Looking into ap\_escape\_html shows: ---- int i, j;  for (i = 0, j = 0; s[i] != '\0'; i++)         if (s[i] == '<' || s[i] == '>')             j += 3;         else if (s[i] == '&')             j += 4;      if (j == 0)         return apr\_pstrmemdup(p, s, i);      x = apr\_palloc(p, i + j + 1);  ---- (i+j+1) can be made almost arbitraty because of int signedness. On linux x86\_64 it was confirmed that sending about 820MB of data overflows (i+j+1) which leads to a crash in memcpy, but with good heap layout more can be done.  Probably only (i) can wrap, but because of the way in which apache leaks memory this is not tested yet.   Fix:  Unofficial fix from an Apache httpd developer, use at your risk. ---------------------------------- Index: server/protocol.c =============================================== RCS file: /home/cvspublic/httpd-2.0/server/protocol.c,v retrieving revision 1.148 diff -u -r1.148 protocol.c --- server/protocol.c    22 Apr 2004 22:38:03 -0000    1.148 +++ server/protocol.c    13 Jun 2004 19:47:36 -0000 @@ -716,6 +716,23 @@                   \* continuations that span many many lines.                   \*/                  apr\_size\_t fold\_len = last\_len + len + 1; /\* trailing null \*/ + +                if ((fold\_len - 1) > r->server->limit\_req\_fieldsize) { +                    r->status = HTTP\_BAD\_REQUEST; +                    /\* report what we have accumulated so far before the +                     \* overflow (last\_field) as the field with the problem +                     \*/ +                    apr\_table\_setn(r->notes, "error-notes", +                                   apr\_pstrcat(r->pool, +                                               "Size of a request header field "  +                                               "after folding " +                                               "exceeds server limit.<br />\n" +                                               "<pre>\n", +                                               ap\_escape\_html(r->pool, last\_field), +                                               "</pre>\n", NULL)); +                    return; +                } +                  if (fold\_len > alloc\_len) {                      char \*fold\_buf;                      alloc\_len += alloc\_len; ---------------------------------- Workaround: not known.

Suite for HP-UX 11i v2.   Please write to security-alert@hp.com
for more information.

Check for Apache Installation

- -----------------------------

To determine if the Apache web server from HP is installed on your
system, use Software Distributor's swlist command. All three
versions products may co-exist on a single system.

For example, the results of the command

swlist -l product | grep -i apache

hpuxwsAPACHE B.2.0.49.00 HP-UX Apache-based Web Server

Stop Apache

- -----------------------------

Before updating, make sure to stop any previous Apache binary.
Otherwise, the previous binary will continue running, preventing
the new one from starting, although the installation would be
successful.  After determining which Apache is installed, stop
Apache with the following commands:

for hpuxwsAPACHE: /opt/hpws/apache[[32]](#32)/bin/apachectl stop

Download and Install Apache

- -----------------------------

- - Download Apache from Software Depot:
  < <http://software.hp.com>>

- - Verify successful download by comparing the cksum with the value
  specified on the installation web page.

- - Use SD to swinstall the depot.

   Installation of this new version of HP Apache over an existing
   HP Apache installation is supported, while installation over a
   non-HP Apache is NOT supported.

Removing Apache Installation

- ----------------------------

If you prefer to remove Apache from your system instead of
installing a newer version to resolve the security problem,
use both Software Distributor's "swremove" command and also
"rm -rf" the home location as specified in the rc.config.d file
"HOME" variables.

%ls /etc/rc.config.d | grep apache

hpapache2conf

hpws_apache[[32]](#32)conf

MANUAL ACTIONS:  Yes - NonUpdate
Install the product containing the fix.

B.11.22  requires upgrading to B.11.23.

# Apache 2: Remote denial of service attack — GLSA **200407-03**

A bug in Apache may allow a remote attacker to perform a Denial of Service
attack. With certain configurations this could lead to a heap based buffer
overflow.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.0.49-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.49-r4**< **2** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems. The goal of this
project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that
provides services in tune with the current HTTP standards.

### Description

A bug in the protocol.c file handling header lines will cause Apache to
allocate memory for header lines starting with TAB or SPACE.

### Impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform a Denial of Service
attack by causing Apache to exhaust all memory. On 64 bit systems with more
than 4GB of virtual memory a possible integer signedness error could lead
to a buffer based overflow causing Apache to crash and under some
circumstances execute arbitrary code as the user running Apache, usually
"apache".

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version:

### Resolution

Apache 2 users should upgrade to the latest version of Apache:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.49-r4"
 # emerge ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.49-r4"
```

# Apache HTTP Server 2.0 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.0. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 2.0 has had no new releases since 2013 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before August 2013. Subsequent issues may have affected 2.0 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.0.65

### moderate: apr\_fnmatch flaw leads to mod\_autoindex remote DoS ([CVE-2011-0419](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0419))

A flaw was found in the apr\_fnmatch() function of the bundled APR library. Where mod\_autoindex is enabled, and a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

Workaround: Setting the 'IgnoreClient' option to the 'IndexOptions' directive disables processing of the client-supplied request query arguments, preventing this attack.

Resolution: Update APR to release 1.4.5 (bundled with httpd 2.2.19) or release 0.9.20 (bundled with httpd 2.0.65)

### moderate: mod\_proxy reverse proxy exposure ([CVE-2011-3368](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3368))

An exposure was found when using mod\_proxy in reverse proxy mode. In certain configurations using RewriteRule with proxy flag or ProxyPassMatch, a remote attacker could cause the reverse proxy to connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing sensitive information from internal web servers not directly accessible to attacker. No update of 1.3 will be released.

Patches will be published to https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply\_to\_1.3.42/

### low: APR apr\_palloc heap overflow ([CVE-2009-2412](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2412))

A flaw in apr\_palloc() in the bundled copy of APR could cause heap overflows in programs that try to apr\_palloc() a user controlled size. The Apache HTTP Server itself does not pass unsanitized user-provided sizes to this function, so it could only be triggered through some other application which uses apr\_palloc() in a vulnerable way.

### important: mod\_isapi module unload flaw ([CVE-2010-0425](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0425))

A flaw was found with within mod\_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod\_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

### low: Subrequest handling of request headers (mod\_headers) ([CVE-2010-0434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0434))

A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy of the headers\_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod\_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

### low: mod\_cache and mod\_dav DoS ([CVE-2010-1452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1452))

A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod\_cache (2.2) and mod\_dav (2.0 and 2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM. This issue is further mitigated as mod\_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod\_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers" directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.
