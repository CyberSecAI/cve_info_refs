  DESCRIPTION

  include: automated file creation; automated index
  updating; editing of all files through a Web-based
  interface; entries with or without titles and time posted;
  automated archiving based on a weekly or monthly format.
  All done through ordinary text files and no additional
  perl modules needed to run it

  DETAILS
  =================================================
  By feeding special crafted data into the uid parameter of the URL, an
attacker
  can by pass the authentication process and access directly
  to the software's control panel.
  The below example will let the hacker add a new user to the software
  account database.
