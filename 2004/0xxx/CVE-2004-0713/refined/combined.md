## BEA WebLogic Server allows unauthorized removal of EJB objects

#### Vulnerability Note VU#658878

Original Release Date: 2004-04-23 | Last Revised: 2004-04-23

---

### Overview

There is a vulnerability in the BEA WebLogic Server that could allow the unauthorized removal of an Enterprise JavaBean ([EJB](http://www.weblogic.com/docs/techoverview/ejb.html)).

### Description

| BEA Systems describes [WebLogic Server](http://www.bea.com/framework.jsp?CNT=index.htm&FP=/content/products/server) as "an industrial-strength application infrastructure for developing, integrating, securing, and managing distributed Java applications." The WebLogic server supports the use of Enterprise JavaBean (EJB) applications. EJB is a component architecture used for building distributed, object-oriented business applications.  When designing an EJB application, there are various methods used to provide an interface with the WebLogic Server. There is a vulnerability in the way WebLogic Server handles calls to the remove() method. When an application implements this remove() method, the application can remove a stateful EJB object from a remote view even if that application does not have permission to remove it.The [BEA Security Advisory](http://dev2dev.bea.com/resourcelibrary/advisoriesnotifications/BEA04_57.00.jsp) states that the following versions of WebLogic Server and Express are affected by this vulnerability:     + WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express version 8.1 through Service Pack 2, on all platforms + WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express version 7.0 through Service Pack 4, on all platforms + WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express version 6.1 through Service Pack 6, on all platforms |
| --- |

### Impact

| Enterprise JavaBean applications implementing the remove() method could allow unauthorized users to remove EJB objects from remote views. |
