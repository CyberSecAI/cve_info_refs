## Apple Mac OS X TruBlueEnvironment vulnerable to buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#902374

Original Release Date: 2004-03-08 | Last Revised: 2004-03-15

### Overview

Apple Mac OS X contains a buffer overflow in TruBlueEnvironment which could allow a local, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Description

| Mac OS X allows older Macintosh applications to run in an environment called Classic. TruBlueEnvironment is part of this Classic environment and is installed setuid root by default. During execution, TruBlueEnvironment fails to validate the length of an environment variable. Using a specially crafted environment variable, an authenticated local attacker could execute arbitrary code with privileges of the vulnerable process. |
