The provided content describes a vulnerability in Mac OS X (10.3.4 tested) where sensitive data, including login, Keychain, and FileVault passwords, are written to swap files without being cleared from memory or protected from swapping.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Mac OS X does not clear memory containing sensitive password data or use `mlock()` to prevent swapping of these data to disk.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Passwords and sensitive data are written to swap files, leaving them exposed. The swap files are not wiped after shutdown or startup.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with root or physical access can recover passwords from swap files. This makes FileVault and Keychain encryption effectively useless.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs root access to view the swap files or needs to boot from an external medium to access the files on the local hard drive.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires root access to the machine or physical access and the ability to boot from an external medium (e.g. CD).
