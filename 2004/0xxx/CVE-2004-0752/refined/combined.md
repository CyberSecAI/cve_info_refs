OpenOffice World-Readable Temporary Files Disclose Files to Local Users

Date:  Thu, 9 Sep 2004 23:52:18 -0400
Subject:  <http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=33357>

Reporter: pmladek
OS:  Linux
Version:  OOo 1.1.2
Summary:  Insecure permissions on temporary files at runtime

When OOo is started, a directory /tmp/sv<RAND>.tmp is created, where
RAND is a 3 character random string.

The permissions of this directory allow other users (depending on the user's
umask) to 'cd' to this directory and list the contents.

Once a file is saved, a zipped file is created in /tmp/sv<RAND>.tmp and the
name of the file follows the same convention. The permissions of the file
allow others (depending on the user's umask) to read the content.

Due to this any user can grab sensitive information of someother user.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Launch OpenOffice.
2. List /tmp contents. Locate the directory 'sv*.tmp'
3. Type in some contents in the document and save it.
4. List the contents of the directory /tmp/sv*.tmp/
5. Do not close OpenOffice. 'su' to a different user.
6. Copy the file under /tmp/sv*.tmp/ to home directory.
7. Use 'unzip' to unzip the files.
8. The file content.xml holds the data the user had just saved.

The workaround is to set more secure umask. The problem is that the users does
not know about it. Why should they need to set more strict umask if they save
its data in a directory which has the correct permissions. They do not expect
that there are any world-readable temporary data available somewhere on the system.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=33357#c0)  pmladek    2004-08-24 15:38:43 UTC  ``` When OOo is started, a directory /tmp/sv<RAND>.tmp is created, where RAND is a 3 character random string.   The permissions of this directory allow other users (depending on the user's umask) to 'cd' to this directory and list the contents.  Once a file is saved, a zipped file is created in /tmp/sv<RAND>.tmp and the name of the file follows the same convention. The permissions of the file allow others (depending on the user's umask) to read the content.  Due to this any user can grab sensitive information of someother user.  Steps to reproduce the problem: 1. Launch OpenOffice. 2. List /tmp contents. Locate the directory 'sv*.tmp' 3. Type in some contents in the document and save it. 4. List the contents of the directory /tmp/sv*.tmp/ 5. Do not close OpenOffice. 'su' to a different user. 6. Copy the file under /tmp/sv*.tmp/ to home directory. 7. Use 'unzip' to unzip the files. 8. The file content.xml holds the data the user had just saved.  The workaround is to set more secure umask. The problem is that the users does not know about it. Why should they need to set more strict umask if they save its data in a directory which has the correct permissions. They do not expect that there are any world-readable temporary data available somewhere on the system. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=33357#c1)  pavel    2004-08-24 17:09:21 UTC  ``` raising prio, security/privacy issue.  ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=33357#c2)  thorsten.martens    2004-08-26 09:42:18 UTC  ``` TM->MAV: Please have a look, thanks ! ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=33357#c3)  mmeeks    2004-08-30 15:03:49 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 17436](attachment.cgi?id=17436&action=diff "a fix.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=17436&action=edit "a fix.") a fix. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=33357#c4)  mikhail.voytenko    2004-08-31 16:06:44 UTC  ``` MAV->MBA: sending to as discussed. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=33357#c5)  Mathias\_Bauer    2004-09-02 15:39:21 UTC  ``` Thanks for the patch, but we already had found the problem by ourselves and solved it in a slightly different way. We don't want to add exported functions to the sal library in a hurry, so we "hacked" the umask in unotools/source/ucbhelper/tempfile.cxx. This is ugly, but gives us some time to think about the desired osl-Interface that we will use in OOo2.0 then.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=33357#c6)  Mathias\_Bauer    2004-09-29 11:19:59 UTC  ``` . ``` |  |
