Subject: /usr/lib/libkdeinit\_dcopserver.so: not using mkstemp, creating temp file unsafely
Date: Sun, 25 Jul 2004 18:55:50 +0100
```
Package: kdelibs-bin
Version: 4:3.2.3-2
Severity: grave
File: /usr/lib/libkdeinit_dcopserver.so
Tags: security patch
Justification: user security hole

dcop/dcopserver.cpp creates a temporary file /tmp/dcopXXXXXX. This file
should be created using mkstemp(3), to avoid /tmp symlink races/attacks.
However, due to a build file oversight, the configure script does not
test for the availability of mkstemp, so HAVE_MKSTEMP is not defined,
and dcopserver.cpp falls back on the insecure tempnam(3) instead.

So every time the dcopserver is started, it creates its temporary file
unsafely, making it potentially vulnerable to symlink attacks. As the
file in question is passed to iceauth, this could expose local
authentication data, or be used to submit mischevious commands to
iceauth.

% nm -D /usr/lib/libkdeinit_dcopserver.so|egrep 'tempnam|mkstemp'
        U tempnam

The patch below should correct (I haven't the nerve to rebuild the whole
of kdelibs :-), but have checked that the individual source file
recompiles correctly) the build scripts to detect mkstemp, enabling the
safe code path in dcopserver.cpp. Of course, in addition to the patch
below, configure.in, configure & config.h.in must be regenerated in the
normal way. This should result in a config.h that defined HAVE_MKSTEMP,
and libkdeinit_dcopserver.so should then use mkstemp instead.

FWIW, note that this should be applied to $(kde-common)/admin/acinclude.m4,
because the acinclude.m4 in the top source directory, is generated from the
admin dir.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1. Systems affected:
KDE 3.2.x up to KDE 3.2.3 inclusive.
2. Overview:
The Debian project was alerted that KDE's DCOPServer creates
temporary files in an insecure manner. Since the temporary
files are used for authentication related purposes this can
potentially allow a local attacker to compromise the account of
any user which runs a KDE application.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CAN-2004-0690 to this issue.
3. Impact:
KDE's DCOPServer creates temporary files in an insecure manner.
Since the temporary files are used for authentication related
purposes this can potentially allow a local attacker to compromise
the account of any user which runs a KDE application.
4. Solution:
Source code patches have been made available which fix these
vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.

Three security advisories have been issued today for KDE. The first advisory
concerns the unsafe handling of KDE's temporary directory in certain
circumstances. The second advisory relates to the unsafe creation of
temporary files by KDE 3.2.x's dcopserver . The third advisory is about a
frame injection vulnerability in Konqueror as earlier reported by Heise
Online and Secunia

Distributions are expected to have updated binary packages available shortly.
All issues mentioned above have also been fixed in the KDE 3.3 Release
Candidate 2 that was announced yesterday . The final release of KDE 3.3 is
expected later this month.

Cheers,
Waldo

KDE Security Advisory: Temporary Directory Vulnerability
Original Release Date: 2004-08-11
URL: <http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20040811-1.txt>

0. References

        <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0689>

1. Systems affected:

        All versions of KDE up to KDE 3.2.3 inclusive.

2. Overview:

        The SUSE security team was alerted that in some cases the
        integrity of symlinks used by KDE are not ensured and that
        these symlinks can be pointing to stale locations. This can
        be abused by a local attacker to create or truncate arbitrary
        files or to prevent KDE applications from functioning
        correctly (Denial of Service).

        KDE creates in ~/.kde symlinks to a temporary directory, a socket
        directory and a cache directory. When a user logs into the KDE
        environment the startkde script ensures that these symlinks are
        present and point to directories that are owned by the user.
        However, when a user runs KDE applications outside the KDE
        environment or when a user runs a KDE applications as another user,
        such as root, the integrity of these symlinks is not checked and it
        is possible that a previously created but now stale symlinks exist.

        The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned the name CAN-2004-0689 to this issue.

3. Impact:

        When a stale symlink is present a local attacker could create the
        directory that the symlink is pointing to with his own credentials
        to prevent access to this directory by KDE applications. This can
        prevent KDE applications from functioning correctly.

        When a stale symlink is present a local attacker could create the
        directory that the symlink is pointing to with his own credentials.
        Since KDE applications will attempt to create files with certain
        known names in this directory, an attacker can abuse this to overwrite
        arbitrary files with the privileges of the user.

4. Solution:

        Source code patches have been made available which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.

        <http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84352>

1. Systems affected:

        All versions of KDE up to KDE 3.2.3 inclusive.

2. Overview:

        The Konqueror webbrowser allows websites to load webpages into
        a frame of any other frame-based webpage that the user may have open.

        The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned the name CAN-2004-0721 to this issue.

3. Impact:

        A malicious website could abuse Konqueror to insert its own frames
        into the page of an otherwise trusted website. As a result the user
        may unknowingly send confidential information intended for the
        trusted website to the malicious website.

4. Solution:

        Source code patches have been made available which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.

# kdebase, kdelibs: Multiple security issues — GLSA **200408-13**

KDE contains three security issues that can allow an attacker to compromise
system accounts, cause a Denial of Service, or spoof websites via frame
injection.

### Affected packages

| Package | **kde-base/kdebase** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.2.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.2.3-r1** |

| Package | **kde-base/kdelibs** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.2.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.2.3-r1** |

### Background

KDE is a powerful Free Software graphical desktop environment for Linux and
Unix-like Operating Systems.

### Description

KDE contains three security issues:

* Insecure handling of temporary files when running KDE applications
  outside of the KDE environment
* DCOPServer creates temporary files in an insecure manner
* The Konqueror browser allows websites to load webpages into a target
  frame of any other open frame-based webpage

### Impact

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to create or overwrite
files with the permissions of another user, compromise the account of users
running a KDE application and insert arbitrary frames into an otherwise
trusted webpage.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version of kdebase.

### Resolution

All KDE users should upgrade to the latest versions of kdelibs and kdebase:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=kde-base/kdebase-3.2.3-r1"
 # emerge ">=kde-base/kdebase-3.2.3-r1"

 # emerge -pv ">=kde-base/kdelibs-3.2.3-r1"
 # emerge ">=kde-base/kdelibs-3.2.3-r1"
```
