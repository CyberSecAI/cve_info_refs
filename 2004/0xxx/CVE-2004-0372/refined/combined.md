# Multiple vulnerabilities in xine — GLSA **200404-20**

Several vulnerabilities have been found in xine-ui and xine-lib,
potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite files with the rights of the
user.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/xine-ui** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.9.23-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.23-r2** |

| Package | **media-libs/xine-lib** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1\_rc3-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1\_rc3-r3** |

### Background

xine is a multimedia player allowing to play back CDs, DVDs, and VCDs
and decoding multimedia files like AVI, MOV, WMV, and MP3 from local
disk drives, and displays multimedia streamed over the Internet. It is
available in Gentoo as a reusable library (xine-lib) with a standard
user interface (xine-ui).

### Description

Several vulnerabilities were found in xine-ui and xine-lib. By opening
a malicious MRL in any xine-lib based media player, an attacker can
write arbitrary content to an arbitrary file, only restricted by the
permissions of the user running the application. By opening a malicious
playlist in the xine-ui media player, an attacker can write arbitrary
content to an arbitrary file, only restricted by the permissions of the
user running xine-ui. Finally, a temporary file is created in an
insecure manner by the xine-check and xine-bugreport scripts,
potentially allowing a local attacker to use a symlink attack.

### Impact

These three vulnerabilities may alow an attacker to corrupt system
files, thus potentially leading to a Denial of Service. It is also
theoretically possible, though very unlikely, to use these
vulnerabilities to elevate the privileges of the attacker.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are advised to
upgrade to the latest available versions of xine-ui and xine-lib.

### Resolution

All users of xine-ui or another xine-based player should upgrade to the
latest stable versions:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=media-video/xine-ui-0.9.23-r2"
 # emerge ">=media-video/xine-ui-0.9.23-r2"

 # emerge -pv ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1_rc3-r3"
 # emerge ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1_rc3-r3"
```
