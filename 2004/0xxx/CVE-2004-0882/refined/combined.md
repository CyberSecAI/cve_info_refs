How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

                      -= Security  Advisory =-

     Advisory: Samba 3.x QFILEPATHINFO unicode filename buffer overflow
 Release Date: 2004/11/15
Last Modified: 2004/11/15
       Author: Stefan Esser [s.esser@e-matters.de]

  Application: Samba 3 <= 3.0.7
     Severity: A buffer overflow inside the QFILEPATHINFO request
               handler allows remote code execution
         Risk: Critical
Vendor Status: Vendor has released a bugfixed version.
    Reference: <http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/132004.html>

Overview:

   Samba is an Open Source/Free Software suite that provides seamless
   file and print services to SMB/CIFS clients. Samba is freely
   available under the GNU General Public License.

   During an audit of the Samba 3.x codebase a unicode filename buffer
   overflow within the handling of TRANSACT2_QFILEPATHINFO replies
   was discovered that allows remote execution of arbitrary code.

   Exploiting this vulnerability is possible through every Samba user
   if a special crafted pathname exists. If such a path does not exist
   the attacker needs write access to one of the network shares.

Details:

   The SMB specification allows clients to specify a maximum amount
   of data bytes that the server is allowed to return in a single
   reply.

   When Samba 3.x receives a TRANSACT2_QFILEPATHINFO request with
   this field set to f.e. zero this can lead to an overflow of a
   unicode filename when constructing the reply.

   This is caused by the fact that Samba <= 3.0.7 reads this field,
   allocates 1024 bytes more than wanted and then writes the reply
   into this buffer without any kind of size check. While this
   behaviour was sufficient enough to protect against overflows in
   Samba 2.x the correction of the replies for the info_levels
   SMB_QUERY_FILE_NAME_INFO and SMB_QUERY_FILE_ALL_INFO to unicode
   full pathname strings allows overflowing the reserved buffer
   size.

   By using unicode chars within filenames this allows to overwrite
   malloc()/free() control structures and therefore allows remote
   code execution.

Proof of Concept:

   e-matters is not going to release an exploit for this vulnerability
   to the public.

Disclosure Timeline:

   24. September 2004 - Made initial contact with the Samba Team
   25. September 2004 - Samba Team has fixed the bug in CVS
   26. September 2004 - Disclosure was delayed on our side because
                        of another issue that was suppossed to get
			disclosed at the same time
   08. November  2004 - Samba Team released 3.0.8 without noticing
                        us because they were wrongly convinced
			that the bug is not exploitable
   15. November  2004 - Public Disclosure

CVE Information:

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
   assigned the name CAN-2004-0882 to this issue.

Recommendation:

   Unlike several other Samba vulnerabilities within the last months
   this vulnerability affects default installations of Samba 3.x and
   therefore any user of Samba 3 <= 3.0.7 should upgrade as soon as
   possible.

Invalid bounds checking in reply to certain trans2 requests
could result in a buffer overrun in smbd.  In order to exploit
this defect, the attacker must be able to create files with very
specific Unicode filenames on the Samba share.

Protecting Unpatched Servers
- - ----------------------------

The Samba Team always encourages users to run the latest stable
release as a defense of against attacks.  However, under certain
circumstances it may not be possible to immediately upgrade
important installations.  In such cases, administrators should
read the "Server Security" documentation found at
<http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/server_security.html>.

## Samba QFILEPATHINFO handling routine contains a remotely exploitable buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#457622

Original Release Date: 2004-11-17 | Last Revised: 2005-04-20

---

### Overview

Samba is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Description

| Samba is a widely used open-source implementation of Server Message Block (SMB)/Common Internet File System (CIFS). A lack of bounds checking in the TRANSACT2\_QFILEPATHINFO request handling routine may allow a buffer overflow. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted TRANSACT2\_QFILEPATHINFO request to a vulnerable Samba server. When the server attempts to create a response, the buffer overflow occurs.  To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the path and file requested must be valid, i.e. the file must exist on the Samba share in the location specified, and the name of the file in the path must contain unicode characters. An attacker with write access to a share could create such a path and filename.Note an attacker must be authenticated to the Samba server. However, a user with anonymous access may be able to exploit this vulnerability.According to reports, Samba versions 3.0.7 and prior are vulnerable. Samba version 2.x are not vulnerable. More detailed information is available in [e-matters security advisory 13/2004.](http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/132004.html) |
| --- |

### Impact

| An remote attacker could execute arbitrary code. The Samba daemon (smbd) typically runs with root privileges, in which case an attacker could gain complete control of a vulnerable system. An attacker may also be able to mount a denial-of-service attack. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade Samba**  This issue has been corrected in Samba version 3.0.8. Please see the [Samba download page](http://us1.samba.org/samba/download/) for more details.**Restrict Access to Samba**As a general security best practice, restrict access to Samba services to hosts and networks that require those services. Consider blocking Samba traffic at network borders.**Consult Samba Security Guidelines**The Samba Team has a [website](http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/server_security.html) listing ways to secure a Samba server. |
