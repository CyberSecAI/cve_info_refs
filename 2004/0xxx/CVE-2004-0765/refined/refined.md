Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The `cert_TestHostName` function in Mozilla's Network Security Services (NSS) library improperly handles certificate hostname matching when the URI hostname is not a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Instead of comparing the FQDN with the certificate's common name, it truncates the common name to its first component and performs the comparison using just that.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Hostname Matching:** The core issue is that the `cert_TestHostName` function performs an insecure hostname comparison. It strips the domain part of a certificate's common name (CN) if the provided URI hostname lacks a domain, which allows for a potential spoofing attack.

*   **Non-Standard Name Matching Behavior:** The function also treated a simple hostname in the cert as if it also matched any subdomain of that hostname. E.g. a cert with CN=foo.bar.com could be used on \*.foo.bar.com.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Spoofing:** An attacker can obtain a valid certificate for a domain they control (e.g., `www.badguys.com`) and use it to impersonate a different site (e.g., `www.internal.company.com`) if users access the latter with a non-FQDN hostname (e.g. `http://www` when `internal.company.com` is part of their DNS search path) . The browser would not display a warning as the certificate would appear to match.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** This spoofing can be used to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker intercepts communications between a client and server.
*   **Bypass of SSL Security:** The vulnerability bypasses the intended security of SSL/TLS, which relies on verification of the domain name.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack occurs over the network.
*   **URI Manipulation:** The attacker does not control the URI but the vulnerability is triggered if the user does not provide a fully qualified domain name when visiting the site.
*   **DNS Manipulation:** The attacker can also change the DNS records for their malicious domain to match that of the internal company domain, although this attack is explicitly noted as not required to exploit the issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Certificate:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid SSL/TLS certificate for a domain they control.
*   **DNS Control (optional):** It may also be necessary for the attacker to have control over DNS records, but it is not an explicitly required attack vector.
*   **User Action:** The user has to access the internal service using a non-FQDN URL.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability existed due to code that was included since at least Netscape Navigator 3.x.
*   The fix required the removal of the non-standard name matching behaviors and now requires that all https URLs contain FQDNs.
*   The fix was applied to NSS 3.10 and 3.9.2, and was backported to older branches, which were used in Mozilla 1.4.3, 1.7, and Aviary 1.0.
*   The security risk of the second non-standard behavior is similar to that of wildcard certificates, but it was decided to remove it as it introduced an "invisible" wildcard, not immediately visible to the admin.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE ID CVE-2004-0765.
