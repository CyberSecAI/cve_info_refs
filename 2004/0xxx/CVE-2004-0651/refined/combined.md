INITIAL RELEASE:    24 May 2004

POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:    Remote Denial of Service (DoS).

SOURCE:    HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY
HP Software Security Response Team

REFERENCES:    Sun Alert ID 57555

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:
A potential vulnerability has been identified with HP-UX Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) where an unprivileged remote attacker
may be able to exploit a Denial of Service (DoS).

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.

BACKGROUND:
A vulnerability in the Java(TM) Runtime Environment with character
decoding may allow an unprivileged remote attacker to cause the
Java Virtual Machine to become unresponsive resulting in a
Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition for the runtime environment and
servers that run on the runtime environment.
