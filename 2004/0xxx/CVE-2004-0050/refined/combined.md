-- Corsaire Security Advisory --

Title: Verity Ultraseek path disclosure issue
Date: 04.01.13
Application: Verity Ultraseek 5.2.1 and prior
Environment: Solaris 7, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Redhat Linux
Author: Martin O'Neal [martin.oneal@corsaire.com]
Audience: Vendor notification
Reference: c040113-001

-- Scope --

The aim of this document is to clearly define a vulnerability in the
Verity Ultraseek search product, as supplied by Verity Inc. [[1]](#1), that
allows an attacker to disclose the actual path of the server side
document root.

-- History --

Discovered: 13.01.04
Vendor notified: 14.01.04
Scheduled release: 30.04.04
Verity requested delay due to bug in patch: 30.04.04
Document released: 05.05.04

-- Overview --

The Verity Ultraseek product provides a web-based search solution. In
the event of an invalid value being entered, the actual path of the
server side document root is disclosed in the error response.

-- Analysis --

The Ultraseek product provides its own web server interface, which
parses URLs and returns search data based on the users selections. If a
document path consisting of a standard device name (NUL, CON, AUX, COM1,
COM2 etc) is entered, then the application responds with an error page
that contains the actual path of the server side document root.

This path can then be used in conjunction with other potential
vulnerabilities to attack specific OS and application configuration
files.

-- Recommendations --

The vendor has released version 5.2.2 of the Ultraseek product, which is
reported not to be susceptible to this issue (although this has not been
independently verified by Corsaire).

-- CVE --

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CAN-2004-0050 to this issue. This is a candidate for
inclusion in the CVE list (<http://cve.mitre.org>), which standardises
names for security problems.
