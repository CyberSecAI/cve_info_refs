- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The game improperly handles the size field in network packets. A large size value will cause the game to read beyond the allocated memory buffer leading to a crash. Specifically, the `rep movsd` instruction is used to copy data based on the size field, and if the size is too big, it will cause an out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper bounds checking when processing the size parameter in a network packet. This leads to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The game crashes due to reading from unallocated memory, causing a denial-of-service. Both the server and client are vulnerable.
- **Attack vectors:** Maliciously crafted network packets with a size value that is too large.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to either the client or server.
