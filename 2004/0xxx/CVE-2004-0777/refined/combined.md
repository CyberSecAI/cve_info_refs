# courier-imap: Remote Format String Vulnerability — GLSA **200408-19**

There is a format string vulnerability in non-standard configurations of
courier-imapd which may be exploited remotely. An attacker may be able to
execute arbitrary code as the user running courier-imapd (oftentimes root).

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-mail/courier-imap** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **3.0.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.0.5** |

### Background

Courier-IMAP is an IMAP server which is part of the Courier mail
system. It provides access only to maildirs.

### Description

There is a format string vulnerability in the auth\_debug() function
which can be exploited remotely, potentially leading to arbitrary code
execution as the user running the IMAP daemon (oftentimes root). A
remote attacker may send username or password information containing
printf() format tokens (such as "%s"), which will crash the server or
cause it to execute arbitrary code.

This vulnerability can only be exploited if DEBUG\_LOGIN is set to
something other than 0 in the imapd config file.

### Impact

If DEBUG\_LOGIN is enabled in the imapd configuration, a remote attacker
may execute arbitrary code as the root user.

### Workaround

Set the DEBUG\_LOGIN option in /etc/courier-imap/imapd to 0. (This is
the default value.)

### Resolution

All courier-imap users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-mail/courier-imap-3.0.5"
 # emerge ">=net-mail/courier-imap-3.0.5"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Joshua J. Berry (CondorDes) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 01:46:02 UTC  ``` There is a format string vulnerability in the auth_debug() function which can be exploited remotely.  This vulnerability can only be exploited if DEBUG_LOGIN is set to something other than 0 in the imapd config file.  Courier versions 1.6.0 through 2.2.1 (inclusive) are affected. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Joshua J. Berry (CondorDes) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 02:09:32 UTC  ``` I should emphasize that this is potentially a remote root, as courier-imapd usually runs with root privileges so that it can access users' mailboxes.  robbat2, or someone from net-mail -- can you please look at the iDEFENSE advisory and tell us what you think?  Will an upgrade to 3.0.x fix the problem?  I know that we still have a 2.1.2 version in Portage; would it be possible to remove that?  I don't think we need to do any keywording; 3.0.2 is already marked stable everywhere it counts.  Security -- I am assuming that since this is a remote root, it's worthy of GLSAage, even though (a) it's for an old version, and (b) it requires debugging to be turned on.  What are your thoughts? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tuan Van (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 07:50:10 UTC  ``` [quote] VI. VENDOR RESPONSE  This issue has been resolved in the latest version of Courier IMAP (v3.0.7). As well, the default setting of 'DEBUG_LOGIN' is '0'. [/quote] Guess we have to bump. robbat2 is on vacation, I'll get the 3.0.7 in the tree very soon. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tuan Van (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 08:55:37 UTC  ``` > Courier versions 1.6.0 through 2.2.1 (inclusive) are affected. I've missed. I've checked authlib/debug.c from 3.0.2 to 3.0.5 and confirm that the   Format String Vulnerability code have been removed. courier-imap-3.0.2.ebuild is stabled for all the arches that have stable keyword with courier-imap-2.1.2-r2.ebuild. ITW, I've removed courier-imap-2.1.2-r2.ebuild from the tree and no other action need on net-mail part or the arches team.  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Joshua J. Berry (CondorDes) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 11:33:03 UTC  ``` Arches: please test net-mail/courier-imap-3.0.5 and mark stable.  I've gone over the different versions (I looked at 2.1.2, 3.0.2, 3.0.4 and 3.0.5).  As far as I can tell, everything up through 3.0.2 (inclusive) is vulnerable.  The problem is the "fprintf( stderr, buf );" line.  In both 2.1.2 and 3.0.2, this is at authlib/debug.c:83.  3.0.4 is not vulnerable, but 3.0.5 is already in the tree, so we might as well bump to that.  I will write the GLSA to reflect this unless someone tells me I'm being stupid. ;) ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Pieter Van den Abeele (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 11:56:25 UTC  ``` stable on ppc ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Tuan Van (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 12:16:10 UTC  ``` x86 done. remove them. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Joshua J.

Thanks to everyone for responding so quickly. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Gustavo Zacarias (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 14:45:11 UTC  ``` sparc stable.  ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Danny van Dyk (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 15:23:56 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Joshua J.

This is what I get for bumps for security updates while I'm on vacation. ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Joshua J. Berry (CondorDes) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-24 11:12:19 UTC  ``` Robin/security team -- Is it worth it to issue errata for that GLSA?  For those who use OUTBOX and it doesn't work, it seems like they would just naturally try to upgrade, and if 3.0.7 is stable, everything will be fine. ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-24 11:31:22 UTC  ``` Arches please mark 3.07 stable.  This is not strictly a security bug so I don't think a GLSA is needed. ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Robin Johnson   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2004-08-24 11:37:56 UTC  ``` I'd say we don't need any errata, but we do need to get the new version in stable. ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Pieter Van den Abeele (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-24 18:28:07 UTC  ``` stable on ppc ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Danny van Dyk (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-25 14:55:05 UTC  ``` stable on amd64 ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Jason Wever (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-25 21:39:29 UTC  ``` Stable on sparc. ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2004-08-25 22:17:51 UTC  ``` all arches are done ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-25 23:12:27 UTC  ``` All done.
