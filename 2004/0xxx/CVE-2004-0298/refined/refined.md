Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of long input strings within the `RETR` command parameter in CesarFTP v0.99e. Specifically, sending a `RETR` parameter with more than 4084 characters causes the server to enter a state where it consumes 100% of the system's CPU resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The server does not properly validate or limit the length of the input provided in the `RETR` command.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The excessive CPU usage indicates a resource exhaustion vulnerability. This can be a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the CesarFTP server to become unresponsive by sending a crafted `RETR` command. This will result in a denial of service for legitimate users. The CPU is pegged at 100% making the server unusable until it's restarted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network by sending a malicious `RETR` command to the FTP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a connection with the vulnerable FTP server.
- **FTP Protocol Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of the FTP protocol.
- **Ability to send long strings:** The attacker must be able to send a RETR command with a parameter exceeding 4084 characters.
