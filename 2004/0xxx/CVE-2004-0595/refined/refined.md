Root cause of vulnerability: The `strip_tags` function in PHP does not properly filter null (\0) characters within tag names when restricting input to allowed tags.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper input sanitization, specifically regarding null characters in tag names.

Impact of exploitation: Allows dangerous tags to be processed by some web browsers which could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

Attack vectors: A remote attacker can inject malicious HTML tags containing null characters within tag names.

Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to supply input to a PHP script that uses the `strip_tags` function.
