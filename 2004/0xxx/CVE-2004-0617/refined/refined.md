Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The ArbitroWeb proxy application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `rawURL` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **JavaScript Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application through the `rawURL` parameter. The application attempts to filter double quotes (") by escaping them with a backslash (\"), but this is not sufficient to prevent JavaScript injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they access a URL processed by ArbitroWeb. This could lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious sites or displaying fake login forms.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the web page.
    *   **Information Theft:** Accessing sensitive information if the browser context contains any.
    *  **Denial of Service (DoS):** Causing the page to become unresponsive via JavaScript loops

**Attack vectors:**
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attack is carried out by crafting a URL that includes a `rawURL` parameter containing malicious JavaScript code, such as `<script>javascript:alert();</script>`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to construct a URL that is processed by ArbitroWeb. They do not require any special privileges on the server. The attacker would likely distribute this manipulated URL to the victim user to trigger the XSS.
