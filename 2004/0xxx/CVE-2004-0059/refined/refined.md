The provided content is related to the following vulnerabilities in WWW File Share Pro <= 2.42:

**A] Arbitrary server's files overwriting:**
*   **Root cause:** The application does not properly sanitize filenames during file uploads, allowing an attacker to use dot-dot sequences (`../`) in the filename to traverse directories and overwrite files outside the designated upload directory.
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper input validation, Path Traversal
*   **Impact:** An attacker can overwrite any file on the server's file system, potentially leading to system compromise.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request with a malicious filename.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the server.

**B] Remote crash:**
*   **Root cause:** Sending a large amount of data using the HTTP POST method leads to excessive resource consumption and can crash the server or freeze the system.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation and resource management
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential system freeze
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a large amount of data using the HTTP POST method.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the server.

**C] Directory authorization bypass:**
*   **Root cause:** The application's authorization mechanism can be bypassed by appending a dot (`.`) to the end of a URL or using one or more slashes/backslashes at the beginning of the URI.
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper URL handling
*  **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected directories.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests with modified URLs.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the server.
