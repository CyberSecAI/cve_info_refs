Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-0977:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2004-0977.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `make_oidjoins_check` script in the `postgresql-contrib` package creates temporary files in an insecure manner. These files are created in world-writable directories with predictable names.
*   **Vulnerability:** Insecure temporary file creation leading to a symlink attack vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vector:** A local attacker could create a symbolic link in the temporary file directory, pointing it to a valid file elsewhere in the filesystem.
*   **Impact:** When `make_oidjoins_check` is executed, it would overwrite the file pointed to by the symbolic link with the privileges of the user running the script (potentially root). This could lead to arbitrary file creation/overwrite, potentially compromising the system.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to create symbolic links in the temporary file directory. The attacker does not need to be root to exploit the vulnerability, but the impact can be more severe if `make_oidjoins_check` is run by root.
*   **Affected Systems:** Systems running affected versions of `postgresql` or `rh-postgresql` that include the vulnerable `make_oidjoins_check` script.  Specifically, Ubuntu 4.10, Debian woody, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, and Gentoo are mentioned.  The OpenPKG CURRENT, 2.2, and 2.1 releases were also affected.
*   **Severity:** The severity is generally considered "low" or "normal" because it requires local access and may not always be exploitable to gain significant privileges. However, the potential for arbitrary file overwrite exists.

**3. Mitigation:**

*   **Upgrade:** The primary solution is to upgrade the `postgresql` package to a version that contains the fix. Specific fixed versions are mentioned in the various advisories (e.g., `postgresql-7.4.5-r2` in Gentoo).
*   **Remove the script:**  One of the documents indicates that removing the script entirely from the RPM is a reasonable response, especially if the script is not essential for normal operation.

**4. Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Trustix Secure Linux and shared with vendor-sec.
*   One of the documents mentions that the `make_oidjoins_check` script is typically only used during the development/release cycle to update regression test scripts, and is not normally run by users. This somewhat limits the attack surface.
*   A patch was created to use `mktemp` to create the temporary files more securely, but there were concerns about portability.

**Summary of Patches/Fixes (From the provided documents):**

*   **Gentoo:** Upgrade to `dev-db/postgresql-7.4.5-r2` or a later version.
*   **Debian:** Upgrade to version `7.2.1-2woody6` for the stable distribution (woody) or `7.4.6-1` for the unstable distribution (sid).
*   **Red Hat:** Fixed in `rh-postgresql-7.3.8-1`. Errata RHSA-2004:489 addresses the issue.
*   **OpenPKG:** Upgrade to `postgresql-7.4.6-20041028` (CURRENT), `postgresql-7.4.5-2.2.1` (2.2), or `postgresql-7.4.3-2.1.1` (2.1).
