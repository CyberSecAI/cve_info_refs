### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves several newly-discovered, public vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own Vulnerability Details section.

If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges. However, user interaction is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers can install only this update.

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces several prior security bulletins. The security bulletin IDs and operating systems that are affected are listed in the following table.

| Bulletin ID | Windows NT 4.0 | Windows 2000 | Windows XP | Windows Server 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [**MS02-014**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33411) | Replaced | Replaced | Not Applicable | Not Applicable |
| [**MS03-027**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=17908) | Not Applicable | Not Applicable | Replaced | Not Applicable |

**Does this update contain any other security-related changes?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin, this update includes the following changes:

* On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, we have made a defense in depth change that limits the functionality of the Shell. This change in functionality prevents the use of the âshell:â protocol so that it does not automatically start applications that have known filename extension mappings when it processes certain types of malformed requests. This change is consistent with the default settings in Windows XP Service Pack 2.
* On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 we have made another defense in depth change that prevents the Shell from using the âshell:â protocol to reference files. This protocol was designed to reference system objects and folders, not to reference files. This change is consistent with the default settings in Windows XP Service Pack 2.

**I am still using Windows XP, but extended security update support ended on September 30th, 2004. However, this bulletin has a security update for this operating system version. Why is that?**

The original version of Windows XP, commonly known as Windows XP Gold or Windows XP Release to Manufacturing (RTM) version, reached the end of its extended security update support life cycle on September 30, 2004. However, the end-of-life occurred very recently. In this case, the majority of the steps that are required to address this vulnerability were completed before this date. Therefore, we have decided to release a security update for this operating system version as part of this security bulletin.

We do not anticipate doing this for future vulnerabilities that may affect this operating system version, but we reserve the right to produce updates and to make these updates available when necessary. It should be a priority for customers who have this operating system version to migrate to supported operating system versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Service Pack Product Life Cycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?pr=lifesupsps).

## Vulnerability Details

#### Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0214:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows Shell starts applications. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability if a user visited a malicious Web site. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0214:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. An attack could only occur after they performed this action.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
* By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

  The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

  + Apply the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-040](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=19873) or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
  + Use Internet Explorer 6 or later.
  + Use the Microsoft Outlook E-mail Security Update, use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or later, or use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or later in its default configuration.

#### Workarounds for Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0214:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Install the** [**Outlook E-mail Security Update**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) **if you are using Outlook 2000 SP1 or earlier to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002 and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

  Customers who use any of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.
* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or later, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or later, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or later and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about enabling this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [307594](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [291387](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ for Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0214:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Unchecked buffers in Windows Shell functions.

**What is the Windows Shell?**

The Microsoft Windows user interface (UI) provides users with access to a wide variety of objects that are necessary for running applications and managing the operating system. The most numerous and familiar of these objects are the folders and files that reside on computer disk drives. There are also a number of virtual objects that allow the user to do tasks such as sending files to remote printers or accessing the Recycle Bin. The Shell organizes these objects into a hierarchical namespace and provides users and applications with a consistent and efficient way to access and manage objects. For more information, visit the following [Web site](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/nhp/default.asp?contentid=28000443).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to host a malicious Web site and then persuade a user to view that Web site. An attacker could also create an e-mail message that has a specially crafted link, and then persuade a user to view the e-mail message and then click the malicious link.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers are only at risk if users are given the ability to log on and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?**

No. Although Windows Millennium Edition does contain the affected component, the vulnerability is not critical. For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Windows Shell validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CAN-2004-0214.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had seen examples of proof of concept code published publicly but had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Program Group Converter Vulnerability- CAN-2004-0572:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Program Group Converter because of the way that it handles specially crafted requests. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious request that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user performed an action such as opening a file attachment or clicking a HTML link. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for Program Group Converter Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0572:

**Note** When you install this security update on Windows Server 2003 or on Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003, the installer checks to see if any of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [824994](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=824994).

**Verifying Update Installation**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. This tool allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP1\KB841356\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 841356 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Verifying Update Installation**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. This tool allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB841356\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 841356 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows NT 4.0 (all versions)

**Prerequisites**

This security update requires Windows NT Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a (SP6a), or Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6 (SP6).

The software that is listed has been tested to determine if the versions are affected. Other versions either no longer include security update support or may not be affected. To determine the support lifecycle for your product and version, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

For more information about obtaining the latest service pack, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [152734](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;152734).

**Installation Information**

The security update supports the following setup switches:

**/Q** Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.

**/Q:U** Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user.

**/Q:A** Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user.

**/T**: **<full path>** Specifies the target folder for extracting files.

**/C** Extracts the files without installing them. If **/T**: path is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder.

**/C**: **<Cmd>** Override Install Command defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the setup .inf or .exe file.

**/R:N** Never restarts the computer after installation.

**/R:I** Prompts the user to restart the computer if a restart is required, except when used with /**Q:A**.

**/R:A** Always restarts the computer after installation.

**/R:S** Restarts the computer after installation without prompting the user.

**/N:V** No version checking - Install the program over any previous version.

**Note** These switches do not necessarily work with all updates. If a switch is not available that functionality is necessary for the correct installation of the update. Also, using the **/N:V** switch is unsupported and may result in an unbootable system. If the installation is unsuccessful, you should consult your support professional to understand why it failed to install.

For additional information about the supported setup switches, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [197147](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;197147).

**Deployment Information**

To install the update without any user intervention and not force the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt:

**Windowsnt4server-kb841356-x86-enu /q:a /r:n**

For Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition:

**Windowsnt4terminalserver-kb841356-x86-enu /q:a /r:n**

For more information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21125).

## Microsoft Windows Program Group Converter vulnerable to buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#543864

Original Release Date: 2004-10-15 | Last Revised: 2004-10-15

---

### Overview

Microsoft Program Group Converter contains a buffer overflow that may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| Microsoft describes Program Group Converter (grpconv.exe) as a application to "convert Program Manager Group files [.grp extention] that were created in Windows 3.1, Windows 3.11, Windows for Workgroups 3.1, and Windows for Workgroups 3.11 so that they could be used by later operating systems. This application is also used during Windows Setup and by third-party applications during the installation of applications or devices."  A vulnerability has been discovered in Microsoft's Program Group Converter. Quoting from Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-037](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-037.mspx):*A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Program Group Converter because of the way that it handles specially crafted requests. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious request that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user performed an action such as opening a file attachment or clicking a HTML link. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.* For further technical information about this vulnerability, please see Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-037](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-037.mspx.). |
| --- |

### Impact

| If a remote attacker can persuade a user to access a specially crafted Program Group (.grp) file that, the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the compromised system, possibly with administrator privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**  Apply a patch as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin  [MS04-037](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-037.mspx). Please also note that Microsoft is actively deploying the patches for this vulnerability via [Windows Update](http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/). **Do Not Accept '.grp' Files from Untrusted Sources**Exploitation occurs by accessing a specially crafted Program Group (.grp) file . By only accepting .grp files from trusted or known sources, the chances of exploitation are reduced. For more details regarding remediation of this issue please see Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-037](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-037.mspx). |
