Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-0966:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insecure temporary file generation within the `autopoint` and `gettextize` scripts of the GNU gettext package.
- These scripts create temporary files in world-writable directories with predictable names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The core weakness is the lack of secure methods for creating temporary files. The scripts use predictable names, making them vulnerable to symlink attacks.
- **Symlink Vulnerability:** Attackers can exploit the predictable temporary file names by creating symbolic links in the temporary directory. These links point to other files on the filesystem that the attacker doesn't have direct access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Overwrite/Modification:** If the vulnerable scripts are run (especially by a privileged user like root), the attacker's symbolic links would cause the scripts to write data into the attacker-specified files. This could lead to overwriting critical system files or escalating privileges.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** Although the provided information does not confirm a direct privilege escalation, the ability to overwrite files owned by a privileged user with a local attack makes the system vulnerable to such an escalation.
- **Data Corruption:** An attacker could overwrite configuration files or other important data, causing system instability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local. An attacker would need to have a user account on the affected system to create the malicious symbolic links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs to have a local user account.
- **Ability to create symlinks in the tmp directory:** The attacker must be able to create symbolic links in the directory where the vulnerable script creates the temporary files.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable scripts:** The attacker needs to know that the specific `autopoint` and `gettextize` scripts in `gettext` are vulnerable to symlink attacks.
- **Patience:** In some cases the attacker would have to wait for a user, especially root to run these scripts.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in the `autopoint` and `gettextize` scripts, not in the libraries or headers of `gettext`.
- The vulnerability was identified by Trustix Security Engineers.
- Multiple sources confirmed the vulnerability existed in the specified `gettext` versions
- Patches have been created for several distributions.
- There is no known workaround except for applying the provided patches and/or upgrading.
