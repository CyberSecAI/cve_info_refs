- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient filtering of user-supplied data in email headers allows for the injection of special characters that are interpreted as shell commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote command execution with the privileges of the user running the confirm script, potentially including root if confirm is used by root.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted email with malicious characters in the headers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a user running the vulnerable confirm script.
