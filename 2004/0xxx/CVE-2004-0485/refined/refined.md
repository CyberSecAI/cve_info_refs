Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the default "disk://" URI handler in Apple Mac OS X. This handler allows the system to interpret and process "disk://" links, which, if crafted maliciously, can be exploited to download files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The core vulnerability is the ability of the "disk://" URI handler to download arbitrary files to a predictable location on the local system without explicit user consent.
- The handler does not adequately validate the source or type of file being downloaded.
- Another vulnerability exists where if the downloaded file is a disk image (".dmg"), it can be automatically mounted, potentially exposing the system to further attacks. This is connected to [VU#578798](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/578798) which is about executing arbitrary files in the mounted disk image.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can download arbitrary files to a known location on a target system without the user's knowledge or explicit permission.
- Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code if they use the vulnerability to download and mount a malicious disk image. This is achieved through the connection with [VU#578798](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/578798).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through malicious web sites. If a user visits a malicious site, it can trigger the download using the "disk://" URI handler without the user's awareness.
- Any application or browser that supports "disk://" URIs can be a vector for the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to entice a user to visit a malicious webpage or click a crafted link that uses the "disk://" URI scheme.
- The attacker needs to know the predictable download location on the target system for the exploit to be effective.

**Mitigation Steps:**
The following steps can be taken to mitigate the vulnerability:

1.  **Uncheck "Open 'safe' files after downloading":** This prevents automatic execution of downloaded files.
2.  **Change protocol helpers:** Disable URI handlers that are not required, e.g. "help://".
3.  **Add a separate protocol helper for "disk":** This step aims to control the default application for "disk://" links.
4.  **Apply the Security Update 2004-06-07:** The patch removes the vulnerable "disk://" URI handler.
