- **Root Cause:** An unchecked buffer in the method that DHCP uses to validate a value from specially crafted network packets.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Buffer Overflow. The DHCP server does not properly validate the length of DHCP messages before passing it to the allocated buffer.
- **Impact:** Denial of Service. An attacker can send a specially crafted DHCP message to cause the DHCP server to stop responding. In a worst case scenario, remote code execution could be possible.
- **Attack Vectors:** Sending a specially crafted DHCP message to a vulnerable DHCP server. This can be done remotely if the server is accessible on the network.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted DHCP message to a vulnerable server. This means the attacker must have network access to the DHCP server, which could be from the local network or over the Internet.
