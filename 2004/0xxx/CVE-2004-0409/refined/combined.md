| [Description](#c0)  foser (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-05 07:18:42 UTC  ``` <http://mail.nl.linux.org/xchat-announce/2004-04/msg00000.html> (patch available)  XChat's Socks-5 proxy code is vulnerable to a remote exploit. To successfully exploit the code, you would need to enable socks5  traversal (default off) and connect to the attacker's own custom proxy server.  If you never intend to use a Socks5 proxy, you are not affected at all by this issue. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-05 07:20:23 UTC  ``` net-irc herd -- can you patch/bump as appropriate?  security: This sounds like a very low-risk vuln.   ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Chuck Short (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-05 08:05:24 UTC  ``` Done ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Chuck Short (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-05 08:05:29 UTC  ``` Done ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-07 08:44:43 UTC  ``` Setting component to Security as this is a vulnerability. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-08 02:05:25 UTC  ``` Socks5 proxy usage is prety common I'd raise the risk factor  up a little as this bug leads to a stack overflowed remotely. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-08 02:12:41 UTC  ``` The patch was applied without version bumping the xchat packages.  Thus, users who have xchat installed already will not necessarily install this new version.  Please version bump things so users will pick them up as a normal part of 'emerge -u world' ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-08 02:13:17 UTC  ``` changed to p1/blocker since this is preventing us from issuing the GLSA. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-13 03:50:46 UTC  ``` Apparently zul has provided the requested ebuilds :  x86, sparc, hppa, ia64 should upgrade to 2.0.7-r1 ppc should upgrade to 2.0.1-r1 amd64 should upgrade to 2.0.6-r2  affected 2.0.1, 2.0.6 and 2.0.7 should be removed. Ready for the GLSA. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-14 12:20:46 UTC  ``` For simplicity's sake (and glsa-check compatibility), it would be better if the latest (2.0.8-r1) was marked stable on all arches. Let's try :)  Arches: please test the latest and mark stable if it works Thanks in advance,  -K ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Gustavo Zacarias (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-14 13:08:49 UTC  ``` 2.0.8-r1 marked stable on sparc.  ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Jon Portnoy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-14 14:00:07 UTC  ``` Stable on AMD64. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Luca Barbato   gentoo-dev  2004-04-14 14:26:24 UTC  ``` Stable on ppc too ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Stephen Becker (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-14 19:28:40 UTC  ``` Stable on mips. ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Bryan Østergaard (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-15 03:06:16 UTC  ``` Stable on Alpha. ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-15 05:42:07 UTC  ``` Still waiting on x86 stable before GLSA release.  For all it's worth, it works for me (2.0.8-r1 / x86) :) -K ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Chuck Short (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-15 06:02:39 UTC  ``` Stable on x86. ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  foser (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-15 07:01:08 UTC  ``` All arches that provide the the gtk1 version (1.8) also need to mark the 1.8.11-r1 release stable. These are ppc & sparc.  Both version (gtk 1 & 2) apparently are vulnerable, i assume Zul did test this when he added the patch. This also needs to be noted in the GLSA . ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-15 07:40:59 UTC  ``` foser: On ppc and sparc, as far as I can tell, 1.8.* was always ~.  The only arches where it has been marked stable are x86 and alpha, and on these arches 1.8.11-r1 is stable.  Please correct me if I miss something, but if I'm right then this bug is ready for a GLSA. We will add something about the gtk1 version.  -K ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Guy Martin (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-15 08:15:27 UTC  ``` 2.0.8-r1 stable on hppa ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  foser (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-15 08:51:14 UTC  ``` ebuilds should not be 'always ~', this whould be a good time to mark them stable (finally i assume).  It avoids confusion : all stable versions (gtk1&2) on all arches are safe (if someone cleans up the older ones). ```  [Comment 21](#c21)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-19 02:38:29 UTC  ``` GLSA 200404-15 is out -- closing ```  [Comment 22](#c22)  foser (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-19 02:52:09 UTC  ``` I actually think that this GLSA lacks, because it sais xchat-2.0.x all over the place, while it's also a 1.8.x bug . That only gets a a short note. Someone with 1.8 probably skipped over this report just be reading the subject. It's not even in the affected packages bit. I'm a bit dissapointed that while i raised this issue 2 times here, it hardly got any serious attention. ```  [Comment 23](#c23)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-20 00:32:17 UTC  ``` You're right, the title is misleading, it would have been much better to talk about "xchat" rather than "xchat 2.0.x".  On a more general note, we had to balance glsa-check compatibility and gtk1 specific information, and since the gtk1 version is ~ (and we don't issue GLSA for ~) I decided on the short note in resolution form.  This brings a bigger problem, which is current GLSA with glsa-check compatibility do not allow for complex per-version resolution paths. For this one we would have needed something like :  affected : (v <= 1.8.11) OR (2.0.0 <= v <= 2.0.8) unaffected : (1.8.11-r1 <= v < 2.0.0) OR (2.0.8-r1 < v)  This is not supported. The only way to do it with the current GLSA/glsa-check system is to have to separate packages : xchat1 and xchat2. I will bring up the problem on the security list to have a better solution the next time we have such a problem. ``` |  |

# XChat 2.0.x SOCKS5 Vulnerability — GLSA **200404-15**

XChat is vulnerable to a stack overflow that may allow a remote attacker to
run arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-irc/xchat** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.8-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.8-r1** |

### Background

XChat is a multiplatform IRC client.

### Description

The SOCKS 5 proxy code in XChat is vulnerable to a remote exploit.
Users would have to be using XChat through a SOCKS 5 server, enable
SOCKS 5 traversal which is disabled by default and also connect to an
attacker's custom proxy server.

### Impact

This vulnerability may allow an attacker to run arbitrary code within
the context of the user ID of the XChat client.

### Workaround

A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are
advised to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.

### Resolution

All XChat users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-irc/xchat-2.0.8-r1"
 # emerge ">=net-irc/xchat-2.0.8-r1"
```

Note that users of the gtk1 version of xchat (1.8.\*) should upgrade to
xchat-1.8.11-r1:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv "=net-irc/xchat-1.8.11-r1"
 # emerge "=net-irc/xchat-1.8.11-r1"
```
