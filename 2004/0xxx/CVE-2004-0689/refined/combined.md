KDE Security Advisory: Temporary Directory Vulnerability
Original Release Date: 2004-08-11
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20040811-1.txt
0. References
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0689
1. Systems affected:
All versions of KDE up to KDE 3.2.3 inclusive.
2. Overview:
The SUSE security team was alerted that in some cases the
integrity of symlinks used by KDE are not ensured and that
these symlinks can be pointing to stale locations. This can
be abused by a local attacker to create or truncate arbitrary
files or to prevent KDE applications from functioning
correctly (Denial of Service).
KDE creates in ~/.kde symlinks to a temporary directory, a socket
directory and a cache directory. When a user logs into the KDE
environment the startkde script ensures that these symlinks are
present and point to directories that are owned by the user.
However, when a user runs KDE applications outside the KDE
environment or when a user runs a KDE applications as another user,
such as root, the integrity of these symlinks is not checked and it
is possible that a previously created but now stale symlinks exist.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CAN-2004-0689 to this issue.
3. Impact:
When a stale symlink is present a local attacker could create the
directory that the symlink is pointing to with his own credentials
to prevent access to this directory by KDE applications. This can
prevent KDE applications from functioning correctly.
When a stale symlink is present a local attacker could create the
directory that the symlink is pointing to with his own credentials.
Since KDE applications will attempt to create files with certain
known names in this directory, an attacker can abuse this to overwrite
arbitrary files with the privileges of the user.
4. Solution:
Source code patches have been made available which fix these
vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.
5. Patch:
Patches for KDE 3.0.5b are available from
ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security\_patches :

# kdebase, kdelibs: Multiple security issues — GLSA **200408-13**

KDE contains three security issues that can allow an attacker to compromise
system accounts, cause a Denial of Service, or spoof websites via frame
injection.

### Affected packages

| Package | **kde-base/kdebase** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.2.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.2.3-r1** |

| Package | **kde-base/kdelibs** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.2.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.2.3-r1** |

### Background

KDE is a powerful Free Software graphical desktop environment for Linux and
Unix-like Operating Systems.

### Description

KDE contains three security issues:

* Insecure handling of temporary files when running KDE applications
  outside of the KDE environment
* DCOPServer creates temporary files in an insecure manner
* The Konqueror browser allows websites to load webpages into a target
  frame of any other open frame-based webpage

### Impact

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to create or overwrite
files with the permissions of another user, compromise the account of users
running a KDE application and insert arbitrary frames into an otherwise
trusted webpage.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version of kdebase.

### Resolution

All KDE users should upgrade to the latest versions of kdelibs and kdebase:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=kde-base/kdebase-3.2.3-r1"
 # emerge ">=kde-base/kdebase-3.2.3-r1"

 # emerge -pv ">=kde-base/kdelibs-3.2.3-r1"
 # emerge ">=kde-base/kdelibs-3.2.3-r1"
```

Three security advisories have been issued today for KDE. The first advisory
concerns the unsafe handling of KDE's temporary directory in certain
circumstances. The second advisory relates to the unsafe creation of
temporary files by KDE 3.2.x's dcopserver . The third advisory is about a
frame injection vulnerability in Konqueror as earlier reported by Heise
Online and Secunia

Distributions are expected to have updated binary packages available shortly.
All issues mentioned above have also been fixed in the KDE 3.3 Release
Candidate 2 that was announced yesterday . The final release of KDE 3.3 is
expected later this month.

Cheers,
Waldo

1. Systems affected:

        KDE 3.2.x up to KDE 3.2.3 inclusive.

2. Overview:

        The Debian project was alerted that KDE's DCOPServer creates
        temporary files in an insecure manner. Since the temporary
        files are used for authentication related purposes this can
        potentially allow a local attacker to compromise the account of
        any user which runs a KDE application.

        The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned the name CAN-2004-0690 to this issue.

KDE Security Advisory: Konqueror Frame Injection Vulnerability

        <http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84352>

1. Systems affected:

        All versions of KDE up to KDE 3.2.3 inclusive.

2. Overview:

        The Konqueror webbrowser allows websites to load webpages into
        a frame of any other frame-based webpage that the user may have open.

        The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned the name CAN-2004-0721 to this issue.

3. Impact:

        A malicious website could abuse Konqueror to insert its own frames
        into the page of an otherwise trusted website. As a result the user
        may unknowingly send confidential information intended for the
        trusted website to the malicious website.

4. Solution:

        Source code patches have been made available which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.
