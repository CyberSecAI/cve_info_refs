Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the way PHP parses array variables, specifically within the `php_variables.c` file.
- When processing GET, POST, or COOKIE variables, appending an open square bracket `[` to an array variable name (e.g., `abc[a][`) causes the length of the array element to be incorrectly determined.
- The length of the array element is calculated using `strlen(var)` instead of the intended `strlen(index)`. This leads to a wrong length and allows reading past the allocated memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Memory Exposure:** The incorrect length calculation allows the `print_r` or `phpinfo()` function to display arbitrary memory content. The content can include pieces of PHP code or other sensitive data present in the heap memory.
- **Incorrect Array Parsing:** The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the array parsing logic within `php_variables.c`, leading to the wrong length being used when processing array elements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the server's memory by exploiting this vulnerability. This information can be used for further attacks.
- **Potential Code Leakage:**  Exposing pieces of PHP code can lead to the discovery of other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability can be triggered via HTTP GET, POST, or COOKIE requests.
- Attackers can craft malicious requests by appending an open square bracket `[` to the end of the variable name (e.g., `abc[a][`)
- Attackers can use tools like `curl` to send such requests, as demonstrated in the example.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server (e.g., access to the web application).
- The attacker does not require any special authentication or privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects PHP versions <= 5.0.1 and does not seem to affect PHP versions <= 4.1.2.
- The fix involves changing `index_len = var_len = strlen(var);` to `index_len = var_len = strlen(index);` in `php_variables.c`.
- A patch was released in CVS to address this vulnerability.
