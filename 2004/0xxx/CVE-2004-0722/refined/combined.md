User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier:
iDEFENSE Security Advisory xx.02.04:
I. BACKGROUND
Netscape SOAPParameter Constructor Integer Overflow Vulnerability
II. DESCRIPTION
Improper input validation to the SOAPParameter object constructor in Netscape
allows
execution of arbitrary code.
The SOAPParameter object's constructor contains an integer overflow which
allows
contollable heap corruption.
A webpage can be constructed to leverage this into remote execution of
arbitrary code.
III. ANALYSIS
Successful exploitation allows the remote attacker to execute abitrary code in
the
context of the user running the browser.
IV. DETECTION
Netscape version 7.0 and 7.1 have been confirmed to be vulnerable. Mozilla 1.6
is also
vulnerable to this issue. It is suspected that earlier versions of both
browsers may
also be vulnerable.
V. WORKAROUNDS
Disable Javascript in the browser.
VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
VII. CVE INFORMATION
VIII. DISCLOSURE TIMELINE
January 17, 2004 Exploit acquired by iDEFENSE.
IX. CREDIT
zen-parse (zen-parse at gmx.net) is credited with this discovery.

here is the code for nsSOAPParameter::nsSOAPParameter:
<http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/extensions/webservices/soap/src/nsSOAPParameter.cpp#46>
note: the function does nothing. there is no code.
perhaps this has to do with the way one constructs a SOAPParameter object in
JavaScript? nsSOAPParameter inherits from nsSOAPBlock which has a JS Initialize
method. perhaps that is the culprit?

Michael, could we get more info on this bug? It's not obvious what the input
should be to trigger the overflow, and it's not obvious from the code what the
overflow would be.

var param = new SOAPParameter();
param.name = "translationmode";
param.value = "en\_fr";
is how you set a SOAP parameter from JavaScript.

gregm, what is that supposed to do? new Array(<very large number here>) will
run for a long, long time, and probably thrash your system, due to suboptimal
code in jsarray.c that initializes every element from 0 to <very large number
here>-1 to undefined.
Assuming you have enough memory and wait long enough, then what happens? No one
has pointed to native code that takes the length of that array and multiplies it
by 4 (e.g.), feeding the result to malloc. Please give an lxr link to such code
if you know of it. Thanks,
/be

There could be some values that will pass the test but not allocate enough space.
for example:
0x55555556 \* 4
main()
{
unsigned int size;
unsigned int capacity=0x55555556;
size=capacity\*sizeof(int);
printf("size=%u\ncapacity=%u\n",size,capacity);
if(size < capacity)
{
printf("Failed to allocate.\n");
}
else printf("It should've failed to allocated.\n");
}
$ ./sample.exe
size=1431655768
capacity=1431655766
It should've failed to allocated.
Admittedly, this would only work if the end user has a REALLY large amount of
memory, but people have more memory in their machines all the time.
Changing the patch from this:
+ size\_t size\_ = capacity \* sizeof(\_t); \
+ if (size\_ < capacity || nsnull == (array = nsMemory::Alloc(size\_))) \
into this:
+ size\_t size\_ = capacity \* sizeof(\_t); \
+ if (size\_ != (capacity \* sizeof(\_t)) || nsnull == (array =
nsMemory::Alloc(size\_))) \

gregm: good point (I wrongly assumed capacity is a multiple of sizeof(\_t)), but
your proposed patch won't work either, without 64-bit integer or floating point
being used to get the multiple result into a larger domain.
I'm fixing the fix to do this instead:
if ((capacity != 0 && size\_ < PR\_ROUNDUP(capacity, sizeof(\_t))) || \
nsnull == (array = nsMemory::Alloc(size\_))) \

Was just going to say that, but you beat me to it.
Why can't you just do:
size\_t const maxCapacity = UINT\_MAX / sizeof(\_t);
if (capacity < maxCapacity)
....
And replace UINT\_MAX with whatever our max PRUint32 value is.

> being used to get the multiple result into a larger domain.
I meant "the \*multiply\* result" (brain still caffeinating today).
Note: PR\_ROUNDUP(i, j) is j \* ((i + j - 1) div j).
Claim:
Let i, j, and M be integers where 0 < j <= i and 0 < i < M:
(i \* j) mod M < j \* ((i + j - 1) div j)
=> i \* j >= M.
Proof by contradiction:
Let (i \* j) mod M < j \* ((i + j - 1) div j),
but i \* j < M.
Then (i \* j) mod M == i \* j, so:
i \* j < j \* ((i + j - 1) div j),
i \* j < i + j - 1.
If j is 1, i < i => contradiction.
If 1 < j <= i, let j be j[n] = j[n-1] + 1:
i \* (j[n-1] + 1) < i + j[n-1],
i \* j[n-1] < j[n-1],
=> contradiction.
Therefore, there is no j in [1, i] such that i \* j < i + j - 1, so
(i \* j) mod M < j \* ((i + j - 1) div j)
=> i \* j >= M.
Note that we can assume j <= i and i < M where M is 2^32, j is sizeof(t\_), and i
is capacity, because we can ignore the case where i < j. In that case, capacity
\* sizeof(t\_) << M, because sizeof(t\_) << M.
Dbradley: we'd want something like
if (capacity > ~(size\_t)0 / sizeof(\_t) || \
nsnull == (array = nsMemory::Alloc(capacity \* sizeof(\_t)))) \
{ \
if(pErr) \
\*pErr = NS\_ERROR\_OUT\_OF\_MEMORY; \
goto failure; \
} \
This is cheaper than all the rounding and so on. Thanks, I'm checking in (I
didn't do the followup checkin yet -- had to do the math first ;-).
I wanted to do the proof above to show what was going on with the initial fix
attempt (both the idea behind it, and the flaw in it).
