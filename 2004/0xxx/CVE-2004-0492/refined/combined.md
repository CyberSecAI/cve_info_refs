## Apache HTTP Server contains a buffer overflow in the mod\_proxy module

#### Vulnerability Note VU#541310

Original Release Date: 2004-10-19 | Last Revised: 2004-10-19

---

### Overview

Apache Web Server contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the mod\_proxy module that may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or launch a denial of service (DoS) attack.

### Description

| The Apache Server is an open-source web server offered by The Apache Software Foundation. The Apache Server uses the mod\_proxy module to implement proxying for various common protocols such as FTP and HTTP. In versions of Apache prior to and including 1.3.31-r2, the mod\_proxy module contains a buffer overflow vulnerability located in the file proxy\_util.c. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must persuade an Apache server with mod\_proxy enabled to connect to a malicious server configured to return an invalid content-length header. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of an Apache child process. Exploitation of this vulnerability may completely disable the Apache  server resulting in a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade Apache**Apache states this issue was fixed in Apache httpd 1.3.32-dev. |

Package:             apache
Vulnerability:       denial of service
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= apache-1.3.31-20040608   >= apache-1.3.31-20040611
OpenPKG 2.0          <= apache-1.3.29-2.0.2      >= apache-1.3.29-2.0.3
OpenPKG 1.3          <= apache-1.3.28-1.3.4      >= apache-1.3.28-1.3.5

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a security advisory from Georgi Guninski [[0]](#0) there
  is a buffer overflow in Apache's [[1]](#1) mod_proxy module. The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2004-0492 [[2]](#2) to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  apache". If you have the "apache" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution) [3][[4]](#4).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][[6]](#6), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][[8]](#8) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[9]](#9), build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [[3]](#3) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [[4]](#4). For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.0, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.0/UPD
  ftp> get apache-1.3.29-2.0.3.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig apache-1.3.29-2.0.3.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild apache-1.3.29-2.0.3.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/apache-1.3.29-2.0.3.*.rpm

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=125704#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2004-06-10 13:26:32 UTC  ``` A security issue has been reported in mod_proxy.  See  <http://www.guninski.com/modproxy1.html>  We have assigned [CAN-2004-0492](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-0492) to this issue.  The flaw affects Apache httpd 1.3.25 to 1.3.31 inclusive that have mod_proxy enabled and configured.  Apache httpd 2.0 is unaffected.  The security issue is a buffer overflow which can be triggered by getting mod_proxy to connect to a remote server which returns an invalid (negative)  Content-Length.  This results in a memcpy to the heap with a large length value, which will in most cases cause the Apache child to crash.  This does not represent a significant Denial of Service attack as requests will continue to be handled by other Apache child processes.  In order to exploit this issue an attacker would need to get an Apache installation that was configured as a proxy to connect to a malicious site.  For Red Hat Enterprise Linux we do not believe that this issue can lead to arbitrary code execution.   A patch to correct this issue is available.  See: <http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=108687304202140>  Public Jun10   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=125704#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2004-06-11 07:41:18 UTC  ``` Even though this is mitigated to being a minor issue we will produce an update for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, including a fix for [bug #122637](show_bug.cgi?id=122637 "CLOSED ERRATA - mod_proxy does reverse DNS lookups (AS2.1)") and [CAN-2004-0488](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-0488).  RHSA-2004:245 in QA   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=125704#c2)  Mark J. Cox    2004-06-14 15:46:11 UTC  ```  An errata has been issued which should help the problem  described in this bug report. This report is therefore being  closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files,  please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report  if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2004-245.html>    ``` |  |

RHSA-2004:245 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2004-06-14
Updated:
2004-06-14
# RHSA-2004:245 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

apache, mod\_ssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Updated httpd and mod\_ssl packages that fix minor security issues in
the Apache Web server are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and
freely-available Web server.

A buffer overflow was found in the Apache proxy module, mod\_proxy, which
can be triggered by receiving an invalid Content-Length header. In order
to exploit this issue, an attacker would need an Apache installation
that was configured as a proxy to connect to a malicious site. This would
cause the Apache child processing the request to crash. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0492 to this issue.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux platforms Red Hat believes this issue cannot
lead to remote code execution. This issue also does not represent a Denial
of Service attack as requests will continue to be handled by other Apache
child processes.

A stack buffer overflow was discovered in mod\_ssl which can be triggered if
using the FakeBasicAuth option. If mod\_ssl is sent a client certificate
with a subject DN field longer than 6000 characters, a stack overflow can
occur if FakeBasicAuth has been enabled. In order to exploit this issue
the carefully crafted malicious certificate would have to be signed by a
Certificate Authority which mod\_ssl is configured to trust. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0488 to this issue.

This update also fixes a DNS handling bug in mod\_proxy.

The mod\_auth\_digest module is now included in the Apache package and should
be used instead of mod\_digest for sites requiring Digest authentication.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users of the Apache HTTP Server should upgrade
to these erratum packages, which contains Apache version 1.3.27 with
backported patches correcting these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade. Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated. Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated. Note that you
can also use wildcards (\*.rpm) if your current directory \*only\* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network. Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate. The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Buffer overflow in apache mod\_proxy,yet still apache much better than windows

You  may  not  modify    it   and   distribute    it   or   distribute   parts of it without the author's written permission - this especially  applies  to so called "vulnerabilities databases"  and  securityfocus,  microsoft,    cert and mitre. If   you   want    to     link     to    this    content      use     the    URL: <http://www.guninski.com/modproxy1.html> Anything in this document may change without notice.  Disclaimer: The  information  in  this  advisory  is  believed   to   be   true   though it may be false. The opinions  expressed  in  this  advisory  and  program  are    my  own and not   of   any     company.    The   usual   standard   disclaimer    applies, especially the fact that Georgi Guninski  is  not  liable  for    any  damages caused by direct  or  indirect    use  of  the  information  or  functionality provided  by  this  advisory  or  program.    Georgi Guninski   bears   no responsibility for  content  or  misuse  of  this  advisory  or  program  or any derivatives thereof.  Description:  There is a buffer overflow in modproxy. It is heap based memcpy with negative size.  Details:  The problem is in proxy\_util.c:  `n = ap_bread(f, buf, MIN((int)buf_size,                           (int)(len - total_bytes_rcvd)));`  clearly len can be negative. ap\_bread leads to memcpy.  Exploitation is unknown, but at least Freebsd 5.2.1 seems promising. The freebsd memcpy implementation copies backwards in this case, which means that by playing with len it is possible to do copy from X to X+K where K seems indepedent of len and X is about half the address space on x86. Apache does some code execution after SEGV, which may be another exploit vector.  Some of the apache guys believe this bug is not exploitable, but they didn't give a proof.  To reproduce make apache fetch the output of pro3.pl. log from freebsd 5.2.1:  `Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. 0x281c0113 in memcpy () from /lib/libc.so.5 (gdb) info stack #0  0x281c0113 in memcpy () from /lib/libc.so.5 #1  0x00000000 in ??
