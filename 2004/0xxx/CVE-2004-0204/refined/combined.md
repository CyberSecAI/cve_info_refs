## Vulnerability Details

#### Directory Traversal Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0204:

A directory traversal vulnerability exists in Crystal Reports and Crystal Enterprise from [Business Objects](https://www.businessobjects.com) that could allow Information Disclosure and Denial of Service attacks on an affected system. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could retrieve and delete files through the Crystal Reports and Crystal Enterprise Web interface on an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Directory Traversal Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0204:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* Systems can only be vulnerable if they have Internet Information Services (IIS) installed.
* The attack is only effective against files where the IIS worker process that is hosting the CrystalDecisions.Web.dll file has delete permissions.

**Visual Studio .NET 2003**

* By default, the IIS worker process that hosts the component that is used to exploit this vulnerability is configured to run under different security contexts, depending on the operating system and server role. All of these accounts are limited type accounts with limited access to resources that are on the system.
  + On Windows 2000 and Windows XP, the machine\ASPNET account is the default security context.
  + On Windows 2000 domain controllers, the IWAM\_MACHINE account is be the default security context.
  + On Windows Server 2003 (IIS Worker Process Isolation Mode), the Network Service account is the default security context.
  + On Windows Server 2003 (IIS5 Compatibility Mode), the machine\ASPNET account is the default security context.
  + On Windows Server 2003 domain controllers, the Network Service account is the default security context.
* Systems that have Visual Studio .NET 2003 installed are vulnerable only if IIS was installed on the system when Visual Studio was installed, and if IIS is still installed.

**Outlook 2003 with Business Contact Manager**

* By default, the IIS worker process that hosts the component that is used to exploit this vulnerability is configured to run under different security contexts, depending on the operating system and server role. All of these accounts are limited type accounts with limited access to resources that are on the system.
* Systems that have Outlook 2003 with Business Contact Manager installed are vulnerable only if IIS was present on the system when Business Contact Manager was installed.
* Outlook with Business Contact Manager is not part of a default install of Outlook 2003 but is available on a separate CD, together with Microsoft Office Small Business Edition 2003 and Microsoft Office Professional Edition 2003.

**Microsoft Business Solutions CRM 1.2**

* On Microsoft Business Solutions CRM 1.2, only authenticated users can access the Crystal Enterprise Web interface.

#### Workarounds for Directory Traversal Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0204:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Stop, disable, or remove IIS**

  + You can stop IIS by issuing the **net stop w3svc** command at a command prompt.
  + You can use the IIS Manager to disable or stop IIS.
  + You can use the **Add or Remove Programs** tool in Control Panel to remove IIS from your system. To find IIS, click **Add/Remove Windows Components**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** If you stop w3svc, the system can no longer provide Web content. If you stop or remove IIS, the system can no longer provide Web, FTP, or NTP content. The SMTP service is also unavailable.
* **To stop or pause a Web site by using IIS Manager**

  + In [IIS Manager](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/library/iis/b0c14479-83e3-435d-a935-819fe396e7d2.mspx), right-click the site that you want to [stop or pause](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windowsserv/2003/standard/proddocs/default.asp?url=/resources/documentation/windowsserv/2003/standard/proddocs/qss_wss_virtdirectories.asp), (in this case the crystalreportwebformviewer2 virtual directory); and then click Stop, or Pause.

  **Impact of Workaround:** The system will no longer provide Crystal Reports through the Crystal Web Interface.
* **To stop or pause a Web site by using a command-line command**

  + Click **Start**, and then click **Run**, type **cmd**, and then click **OK**.
  + At the command prompt, type **cscript iisweb.vbs** ***/action*** "***WebSiteName***", and then press **ENTER**. Substitute stop or pause for ***action***. Substitute your actual Web site name (for example "Default Web Site") for ***WebSiteName***.

  **Impact of Workaround:** The system will no longer provide Crystal Reports through the Crystal Web Interface.
* **Modify the crystalreportwebformviewer2 virtual directory to allow only authenticated and authorized access**

  + Use [IIS Manager](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/library/iis/b0c14479-83e3-435d-a935-819fe396e7d2.mspx) to modify the crystalreportwebformviewer2 virtual directory and make it more restrictive. For example, you can make it allow only members of the Authenticated Users group, and disallow anonymous access.

    **Impact of Workaround:** Anonymous access to the Crystal Reports Web viewer would no longer be available.
* **Restrict the** [**Access Control**](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windowsserv/2003/standard/proddocs/acl_topnode.asp) **List (ACL) on the crystalimagehandler.aspx file to allow access to authenticated and authorized users only**

  + IIS supports controlling access to directories and files on a local computer by using all Windows authentication methods. Modify the ACL on the crystalimagehandler.aspx file to be more restrictive. For example, you can make it allow access to only a limited group of authenticated users.
  + **Note** You must use this workaround in conjunction with the âModify the crystalreportwebformviewer2 virtual directory to allow only authenticated and authorized accessâ workaround.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Only authenticated and authorized users will be able to access your Web site.

For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, see the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/evaluation/capabilities/patch.mspx). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/20/featurepacks/suspack/) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, see the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sms/sms2003/patchupdate.mspx). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [**SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack**](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/sms/2003/downloads/featurepacks/adminpack.mspx) and in the [**SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack**](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/20/featurepacks/adminpack/)) to install these updates.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Dear List,

Imperva(tm)'s Application Defense Center has discovered several
vulnerabilities in BusinessObject's Crystal Reports' Web Interface.
These vulnerabilities allow a potential hacker to retrieve and delete
any file from the file system of the server on which it runs, as well as
causing a complete denial of service to the server.

In the past week, we have attempted to contact BusinessObjects in order
to provide them the details of the vulnerability, so that a patch can be
issued by them to solve the problem. Since we were unable to find any
security-specific contact, we have attempted to notify them through all
known support email addresses, the support contact form on their site,
and several standard email addresses, such as info, support, security,
etc.

Sadly, none of these attempts has succeeded. We therefore send it in
here, hoping this list is read by anyone related to BusinessObjects or
by anyone who knows how to contact their security related staff. Any
assistance in contacting the right person would be appreciated.

Sincerely,

---

Arbitrary File Access and Denial of Service Vulnerabilities in the
Business Objects' Crystal Report Web Delivery Modules

Background
==========
Crystal Reports and Crystal Enterprise are a leading reporting and data
presentation solution from Business Objects(r) (who acquired Business
Decisions earlier this year). Both contain components for web delivery
of reports, using various common web technologies (ASP, ASP.NET, jsp
etc.). Those web presentation components render the requested report
into HTML documents delivered to the end user through a web server.
Images, especially charts and graphs, included in the report are
rendered as temporary PNG files linked to from the HTML document. The
temporary PNG files are delivered through a dedicated module upon
request from a client (e.g. a web browser) and then deleted.

Scope
=====
Imperva(tm)'s Application Defense Center has conducted research on the
widely used Crystal Reports product and have determined that the modules
which deliver image files through the web are vulnerable in a way that
can be exploited for arbitrary file access and denial of service.

The Findings
============
While using Crystal Report in a web environment, there are modules for
delivering image files (charts, graphs, dynamically chosen pictures,
etc.). There is one such module for each prominent web delivery
technology (ASP, ASP.NET and jsp). These modules deliver an image file
by its name and then remove it from hard disk. An attacker is able to
use this module to access arbitrary files on the server and remove them.

Details
=======
1. Arbitrary File Access and Removal
------------------------------------
The web reporting engine of the Crystal Reports package renders a report
as an HTML document that contains hyperlinks to images. The images are
not accessed directly from the client but rather delivered through a
dedicated module (crystalimagehandler.aspx, crystalimagehandler.asp or
crystalimagehandler.jsp). This module accepts a single parameter called
dynamicimage that specifies the name of a temporary image file created
by the rendering engine. The file is delivered to the client and then,
by default, removed from the disk. A common request would be similar to
the following:
<http://foo.bar/crystalreportviewers/crystalimagehandler.aspx?dynamicimag>
e=2a7173aa-a2e4-4f96-b9e1-11332c696bbd.png
Which will send the file named 2a7173aa-a2e4-4f96-b9e1-11332c696bbd.png
to the requesting client, and delete it. The module is susceptible to
directory traversal and would deliver any file on the disk that is
specified by the parameter dynamiciamge. Hence, if the image files are
created in c:\winnt\temp then the following request:
<http://foo.bar/crystalreportviewers/crystalimagehandler.aspx?dynamicimag>
e=..\win.ini
delivers the file win.ini and the following request:
<http://foo.bar/crystalreportviewers/crystalimagehandler.aspx?dynamicimag>
e=..\..\boot.ini
delivers the file boot.ini from the disk's root directory.
In addition to delivering the request file which may contain
confidential information the module removes the file from the disk. This
of course may lead to a denial of service. For example, if win.ini is
request through this module it will be removed from the disk and the
attacked server will not be able to reboot.

2. Disk Space Exhaustion
------------------------
The Crystal Reports web delivery module relies on the image delivery
module to both deliver the image file and cleanup the disk space it
occupies. Hence, calling the report generation modules repeatedly
without retrieving the related images (e.g. by using a Perl script)
causes the report engine to take up more and more space in the image
file folder. Not only is disk space consumed quickly but response time
for other users become substantially longer as the number of files in
the folder increase. Eventually disk space will become exhausted.

Exploit
=======
The exploit is carried out by simply sending a request URL to the
crystal reports server that looks like this:
<http://foo.bar/crystalreportviewers/crystalimagehandler.aspx?dynamicimag>
e=..\..\..\..\..\mydocuments\private\passwords.txt
