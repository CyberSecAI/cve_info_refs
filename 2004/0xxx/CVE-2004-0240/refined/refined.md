The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in X-Cart version 3.4.3. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Arbitrary File Viewing**
*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of file paths in the `auth.php` script.
*   **Weakness:** Path Traversal vulnerability. The application allows the user to specify a file path through the `shop_closed_file` parameter without proper sanitization or validation.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can view any file on the web server that the web server's user has access to. This can include configuration files, database credentials, and other sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `auth.php` script with a manipulated `shop_closed_file` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No special capabilities are needed. Any user can exploit this vulnerability.

**2. Arbitrary Command Execution**
*   **Root Cause:** The `upgrade.php` and `general.php` scripts allow execution of arbitrary commands.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of input parameters, allowing an attacker to inject shell commands. Specifically, the `perl_binary`, `patch_exe` and `patch_files` parameters are used to execute commands.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `upgrade.php` or `general.php` scripts with manipulated `perl_binary`, `patch_exe` or `patch_files` parameters.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No special capabilities are needed. Any user can exploit this vulnerability.

**3. Information Leakage**
*   **Root Cause:** The `general.php` script exposes sensitive information through `phpinfo` and `perlinfo` modes.
*   **Weakness:** Insecure disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can obtain sensitive information about the web server and its environment. This information can be used to facilitate other attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `general.php` script with the `mode` parameter set to `phpinfo` or `perlinfo`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No special capabilities are needed. Any user can exploit this vulnerability.
