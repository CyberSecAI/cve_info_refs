BindView Security Advisory
--------

Remote anonymous attackers can read large amounts of memory from and/or
crash any NT4 RPC server

Issue Date: 12Oct2004
Contact:  loveless@bindview.com
Author:  Todd Sabin

Topic:
A flaw in rpc__mgmt_inq_stats allows attackers to retrieve memory from and
crash NT4 RPC servers.

Overview:

Due to a flaw in the implementation of a standard RPC interface,
attackers can retrieve large amounts of the memory from the address
space of NT4 RPC servers.  In addition to retrieving memory, it is
possible to crash any NT4 RPC server by asking for extremely large
amounts of memory, the RPC server will attempt to read from
inaccessible parts of memory, causing an exception, and the
termination of the RPC server.

Affected Systems:
All NT4 systems running RPC servers

Impact:

Anonymous attackers can crash any RPC server.  This includes the SAM
and LSA, the main RPC service, the Server service, etc.  Many
applications are also based on RPC or support it, including Exchange
and SQL Server.

In addition to crashing servers, an attacker can read large amounts of
memory from the address space of the servers.  Depending on the
server, this may result in the disclosure of sensitive information.
For example, during testing against the LSA of an NT4 domain
controller, the Administrator's password hash was retrieved.

Details:

As per the guidelines as set forth in the Organization for Internet
Safety, BindView will not be releasing technical details about this flaw
for 30 days. See <http://www.oisafety.org/> for more details on these
guidelines.

Workarounds:
None known

Recommendations:
Install the patch from Microsoft.

## Vulnerability Details

#### RPC Runtime Library Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0569:

An information disclosure and [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists when the RPC Runtime Library processes specially crafted messages. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could potentially read portions of active memory or cause the affected system to stop responding.

#### Mitigating Factors for RPC Runtime Library Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0569:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for RPC Runtime Library Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0569:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Block the following at the firewall:**

  + **UDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445, and TCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593**
  + **All unsolicited inbound traffic on ports greater than 1024**
  + **Any other specifically configured RPC port**
  + **If installed, COM Internet Services (CIS) or RPC over HTTP, which listen on ports 80 and 443**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with RPC. Blocking them at the firewall will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Also, make sure that you block any other specifically configured RPC port on the remote system. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about the ports that RPC uses, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312). For more information about how to disable CIS, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [825819](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;825819).
* **Enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For additional information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [309798](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;309798).
* **Block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and how to apply filters is available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Articles [313190](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;313190) and [813878.](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=813878)

An unchecked buffer in the RPC Runtime Library.

**What is Remote Procedure Call (RPC)?**

[Remote Procedure Call (RPC)](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa373935) is a protocol that the Windows operating system uses. RPC provides an interprocess communication mechanism that allows a program that is running on one system to access services seamlessly on another system. The protocol is derived from the Open Software Foundation (OSF) RPC protocol, with the addition of some Microsoft-specific extensions.

**What is the RPC Runtime Library?**

By default, the RPC Runtime Library is installed on all affected systems. The RPC Runtime Library provides services such as communication services, directory services, and security services to application developers. For more information about the RPC Runtime Library, visit the following [MSDN Library Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa373631).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding or potentially read portions of active memory.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who can deliver a series of specially crafted messages to the affected system could attempt to exploit this vulnerability. By default, this ability is enabled on the affected systems. Therefore, any user who can establish a connection to an affected system could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a series of specially crafted network messages and sending the messages to an affected system.

An attacker could also access the affected component through another vector. For example, an attacker could log on to the system interactively or by using another program that passes parameters to the vulnerable component (locally or remotely).

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet. Microsoft has provided information on how you can help protect your PC. IT Professionals can visit the [Security Center Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21171).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that RPC Runtime Library validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.
