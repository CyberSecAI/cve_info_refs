## freeRADIUS Server vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack

#### Vulnerability Note VU#541574

Original Release Date: 2004-10-06 | Last Revised: 2005-02-01

---

### Overview

Multiple vulnerabilities in freeRADIUS Server may allow attackers to cause a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| The Remote Authentication Dial In User Service ([RADIUS)](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2865.txt) protocol is used for remote user authentication and accounting. freeRADIUS Server is an popular open-source RADIUS server.  According to freeRADIUS, three independent bugs in freeRADIUS Server versions 0.8.0 to 1.0.0 inclusive, may cause a denial-of-service condition. According to Alan T. DeKok from the freeRADIUS project these vulnerabilities are the result of:     + *The function which decodes RADIUS attributes into data structures did not properly check for malformed USR vendor-specific attributes. As a result, when the server received any packet containing a malformed USR VSA, it could be convinced to call "memcpy" with a length value of "-1", which memcpy would interpret as 0xffffffff. The resulting infinite copy would cause the server to core dump.*    + *The function which decodes RADIUS attributes into data structures did not properly check for certain pre-conditions before decoding Ascend-Send-Secret and Ascend-Recv-Secret attributes. As result, when the server received an Access-Request or Accounting-Request packet containing an Ascend-Send-Secret or Ascend-Recv-Secret attribute, it could be convinced to call a function to decode the contents of the attribute, with a NULL pointer, where that function expected a pointer to a valid data structure. That function would de-reference the NULL pointer, and cause the server to core dump.*    + *The function which decodes RADIUS attributes into data structures did not properly clean up after itself if the Ascend-Send-Secret, Ascend-Recv-Secret, or Tunnel-Password attributes were received in an Access-Request packet. As a result, a previously allocated data structure was not freed, and the server would leak a data structure of approximately 300 bytes for every Access-Request packet it received which contained those RADIUS attributes. If sufficient packets matching that criteria were received, the server process would run out of memory, and would be killed by the OS.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to crash the freeRADIUS Server causing a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade freeRADIUS**These vulnerabilities were corrected in freeRADIUS Server version 1.0.1. |
| --- |

| **Limit Access to freeRADIUS**  To reduce the impact of exploitation, access to freeRADIUS services should restricted to only trusted hosts on necessary ports (1812 UDP for Authentication and 1813 UDP for Accounting). |

### [Foundry Networks Inc.](#JGEI-65GRWU) Not Affected

Notified:  October 05, 2004  Updated: October 06, 2004

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

Foundry switches and routers are not vulnerable.

Foundry does not utilize the freeRADIUS software in any of its product offerings.

Foundry does recommend that any customer using the freeRADIUS server should upgrade their freeRADIUS software. Servers that are not upgraded run the risk of being successfully attacked using this vulnerability, causing the device to crash and lose network connectivity. Devices using the IEEE 802.1x authentication mechanism would not be authenticated when the RADIUS server is down and would not be allowed access to the network.

# FreeRADIUS: Multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities — GLSA **200409-29**

Multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities were found and fixed in
FreeRADIUS.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-dialup/freeradius** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.1** |

### Background

FreeRADIUS is an open source RADIUS authentication server
implementation.

### Description

There are undisclosed defects in the way FreeRADIUS handles incorrect
received packets.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially-crafted packets to the
FreeRADIUS server to deny service to other users by crashing the
server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All FreeRADIUS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-dialup/freeradius-1.0.1"
 # emerge ">=net-dialup/freeradius-1.0.1"
```
