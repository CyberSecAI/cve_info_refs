Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2004-0961:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from multiple flaws in the way FreeRADIUS Server decodes RADIUS attributes, specifically:

1.  **Malformed USR Vendor-Specific Attributes (VSA):** The function decoding RADIUS attributes didn't validate malformed USR vendor-specific attributes. This caused `memcpy` to be called with a length of "-1", which was interpreted as `0xffffffff`, leading to an infinite copy operation and a server crash.
2.  **Missing Precondition Checks for Ascend Attributes:** The decoding function failed to verify preconditions before processing Ascend-Send-Secret and Ascend-Recv-Secret attributes. This resulted in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a server crash when processing an Access-Request or Accounting-Request with these attributes.
3.  **Memory Leak:** The decoding function didn't clean up properly after processing Ascend-Send-Secret, Ascend-Recv-Secret, or Tunnel-Password attributes in an Access-Request packet. This resulted in a memory leak (approximately 300 bytes per packet) that could eventually exhaust the server's memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper input validation of vendor-specific attributes.
*   Lack of checks for null pointers before dereferencing them.
*   Failure to free allocated memory after processing certain attributes

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by crashing the FreeRADIUS server or by exhausting its memory. This would disrupt authentication and accounting services, affecting users relying on the RADIUS server.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is remote. An attacker can send crafted RADIUS packets to the server on ports 1812 (UDP for authentication) and 1813 (UDP for accounting).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the target FreeRADIUS server.
*   The attacker does not need any prior authentication to trigger this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to craft RADIUS packets including specifically crafted malformed USR VSA attributes or Access-Request/Accounting-Request packets with Ascend-Send-Secret/Ascend-Recv-Secret/Tunnel-Password attributes.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities affect freeRADIUS Server versions 0.8.0 to 1.0.0, inclusive.
*   The issue is resolved in freeRADIUS Server version 1.0.1.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 200409-29 addresses this issue and recommends upgrading to the fixed version.
*   The CERT vulnerability note VU#541574 provides a detailed description of the issues and affected vendors.
