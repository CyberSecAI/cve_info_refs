Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in PHPGEDVIEW 2.61:

**1) PHP Code Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The application uses user-controlled input (`PGV_BASE_DIRECTORY`) in `require` statements without proper sanitization.
*   **Vulnerability:** PHP code injection vulnerability. The application includes files based on the value of the `PGV_BASE_DIRECTORY` parameter.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by specifying a malicious URL for `PGV_BASE_DIRECTORY`.
*   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request. By manipulating the `PGV_BASE_DIRECTORY` parameter in the URL.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to host a malicious PHP file on a web server.

**Affected Files:**
    * `authentication_index.php`
    * `functions.php`
    * `config_gedcom.php`

**2) Configuration Reinstallation**

*   **Root Cause:** The `editconfig.php` file, used for initial setup, is not removed after installation.
*   **Vulnerability:** Allows for configuration reinstallation.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can reinstall the application and change the administrator password.
*   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the `editconfig.php` file via HTTP GET request.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires no specific capabilities beyond knowing the location of the `editconfig.php` file.

**3) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** User-provided input is reflected in the output without proper sanitization in search.php
*   **Vulnerability:** Reflected XSS.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser, leading to various attacks like cookie theft or session hijacking.
*  **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request. By injecting malicious JavaScript into the `firstname`, `lastname`, `place` or `year` parameter of the search.php page.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires no specific capabilities beyond crafting a malicious URL.

**4) Information Disclosure (phpinfo())**

*   **Root Cause:** The application allows access to the `phpinfo()` function through a URL parameter.
*   **Vulnerability:** Information Disclosure. The application displays server information using phpinfo().
*   **Impact:** An attacker can obtain sensitive server information, which could be used to further exploit the system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to `admin.php?action=phpinfo` via HTTP GET request.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires no specific capabilities beyond knowing the location of the admin.php page.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **PHP Code Injection:** Critical vulnerability allowing remote code execution.
*   **Config Reinstallation:** Medium risk, allowing the takeover of the admin account.
*   **XSS:** Medium risk, enables client-side attacks.
*   **phpinfo() disclosure**: Low risk, exposing server configuration information.
