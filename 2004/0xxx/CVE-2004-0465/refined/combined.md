## OpenConnect Webconnect read-only directory traversal vulnerability in jretest.html

#### Vulnerability Note VU#628411

Original Release Date: 2005-02-21 | Last Revised: 2005-02-21

---

### Overview

OpenConnect Webconnect contains a read-only directory traversal vulnerability in the file jretest.html.

### Description

| OpenConnect Webconnect provides secured web access and emulation services for backend mainframes and UNIX servers. Versions of Webconnect prior to 6.4.5 and 6.5.1 running on all operating systems have a read-only directory traversal vulnerability. By sending a specially-crafted GET request, INI-style files outside of the web server root directory will be incorrectly parsed and have individual attribute values exposed in an error message.  Files exposed by jretest.html must be formatted in an INI-style format popularized by Microsoft Windows:[section]attribute1 = value1attribute2 = value2, value3, value4Per the [OpenConnect Vendor Statement](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/JSHA-69HVPK) for VU#628411:The file being accessed must be in ini-style to be parsed within WebConnect.  The jretest.html page will attempt to retrieve a user configuration value from that file.  When the value is found to be invalid, it is displayed within the returned error html page. This allows the end user to see the value for one key within the ini-style file.  The entire file is not displayed to the user nor can the user manipulate the file in any way. This vulnerability is present in all platform versions of WebConnect but is Windows-focused due to the need for the target file to be ini-style. |

### Impact

| Exploitation of this read-only directory traversal vulnerability discloses limited types of information.Per the [OpenConnect Vendor Statement](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/JSHA-69HVPK) for VU#628411:The file being accessed must be in ini-style to be parsed within WebConnect.  The jretest.html page will attempt to retrieve a user configuration value from that file.  When the value is found to be invalid, it is displayed within the returned error html page.

### Solution

| Affected sites should upgrade to a corrected version of WebConnect, versions 6.4.5 and 6.5.1. Licensed users can send mail to OpenConnect technical support mailto: ocs\_support@oc.com, or call +1-972-888-0678. |

### Vendor Statement

**Vulnerability Note VU#628411**

**OpenConnect WebConnect Directory Traversal Vulnerability**

**Overview**

Manipulation of parameters to jretest.html may allow exposure of limited file data outside the WebConnect installation directory.

**I. Description**

From the OpenConnect webpage:

WebConnect is client-server based software that provides secure browser based emulation to mainframe, midrange and UNIX systems. WebConnect enables enterprise organizations to provide suppliers, partners and employees with secure access to vital applications and information. Enterprises increase productivity and profits, and retain all the advantages of secure host connectivity to new and existing applications in "real-time."

Because WebConnect is non-intrusive, it provides secure SSL encrypted information migration and access without requiring modification to the host. With its patented secure, "persistent connectivity" technology, only WebConnect is capable of supporting tens of thousands of concurrent browser-based users.

WebConnect 6.4.4 and 6.5 do not validate access to product configuration file pathnames outside the installation directory. This can allow the parsing of ini-style files and display of one value from the file in html returned to the user.

**II. Impact**

The file being accessed must be in ini-style to be parsed within WebConnect. The jretest.html page will attempt to retrieve a user configuration value from that file. When the value is found to be invalid, it is displayed within the returned error html page. This allows the end user to see the value for one key within the ini-style file. The entire file is not displayed to the user nor can the user manipulate the file in any way. This vulnerability is present in all platform versions of WebConnect but is Windows-focused due to the need for the target file to be ini-style.

**III. Solution**

**Update to a corrected version of WebConnect**

This vulnerability has been corrected in WebConnect versions 6.4.5 and 6.5.1. Licensed users of WebConnect may contact OpenConnect Technical Support to receive these updated versions.

The WebConnect 6.4.4 and 6.5 contains several vulnerabilities such as:
 - Denial of Service when requesting an DOS Device in Path Name
 - Reading of files outside webroot (Directory traversal)

Requesting "DOS Device in Path Name" Denial of Service
When requesting a DOS device in the URL the server will stop responding
to any further requests before a manual restart of service has been made.
This attack can be preformed on both the client website and the
administration interface.

Vulnerable versions:
 - WebConnect 6.4.4 (Possible previous versions)
 - WebConnect 6.5

CERT response:
 - VU#552561 CAN-2004-0466

Reading of files outside webroot (Directory traversal)
When sending a specially crafted request to the server it is possible to
read files outside the webroot. Since the service as default runs with
system rights, this could give access to the entire partition that
WebConnect
are installed on.

Vulnerable versions:
 - WebConnect 6.4.4 (Possible previous versions)

CERT response:
 - VU#628411 CAN-2004-0465
