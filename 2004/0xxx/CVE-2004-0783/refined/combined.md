CESA-2004-005 - rev 2
http://scary.beasts.org/security/CESA-2004-005.txt
[See all my vulnerabilities at http://scary.beasts.org/security]
gtk+-2.4.4 XPM image decoder parsing flaws
==========================================
Programs: gtk+, and any programs which use gtk+ to decode XPM files.
For example, Evolution.
Severity: Compromise of account used to browse malicious XPM file.
CAN identifier(s): CAN-2004-0782, CAN-2004-0783
This advisory lists code flaws discovered by inspection of the XPM parser
within the gtk+ code. Specifically, gtk+-2.4.4 was investigated.
Flaw 1. Heap-based overflow in pixbuf\_create\_from\_xpm (io-xpm.c)
CAN-2004-0782
name\_buf = g\_new (gchar, n\_col \* (cpp + 1));
colors = g\_new (XPMColor, n\_col);
Here, n\_col is an arbitrary integer value from the XPM. cpp is an integer value
ranging from 1 to 31 from the XPM. By careful choice of values of n\_col and
cpp, integer overflow can occur on integer multiplication. This leads to heap
buffers being allocated that cannot hold n\_col elements, so a subsequent heap
overflow occurs.
Demo XPM: http://scary.beasts.org/misc/gdk1.xpm
Flaw 2. Subtle stack-based overflow in xpm\_extract\_color (io-xpm.c)
CAN-2004-0783
gint space = 128;
gchar word[128], color[128], current\_color[128];
...
if (color[0] != '\0') {
strcat (color, " ");
[\*] space--;
}
strncat (color, word, space);
space -= MIN (space, strlen (word));
Here, an attempt is actually made to prevent overflow of the stack buffers.
However, a logic error means one of the buffers can still be made to overflow.
When "space" reaches 0, "space" can be sent to -1 by the line marked with [\*],
if the color string is broken up by whitespace. When "space" is -1, the
strncat() call is effectively morphed to a strcat() call, allowing overflow of
the "color" buffer (probably into the "word" buffer, which may cause a minor
inconvenience to exploitation. Note use of the word "minor" :-)
Demo XPM: http://scary.beasts.org/misc/gdk2.xpm

## GdkPixbuf XPM parser contains a stack overflow vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#369358

Original Release Date: 2004-10-01 | Last Revised: 2004-10-28

---

### Overview

A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the XPM handling of GdkPixbuf. This vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition or execution of arbitrary code.

### Description

| [GdkPixbuf](http://developer.gnome.org/arch/imaging/gdkpixbuf.html) is a library used by [GTK+ 2](http://www.gtk.org/) for loading and rendering images. GTK+ is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces. It is used by the [Gnome](http://www.gnome.org/) desktop and other applications. GdkPixbuf contains a stack overflow vulnerability in the xpm\_extract\_color() function of the XPM loading routine. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing the user to open a specially crafted XPM file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by crashing the application that uses GdkPixbuf. It may also be possible to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of that application. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from your vendor**  For vendor-specific information regarding vulnerable status and patch availability, please see the vendor section of this document.**Upgrade your version of gtk+**Upgrade your system as specified by your vendor. If you need to compile the software from the original source, get [gtk+ 2.4.10](http://www.gtk.org/download/). |

CESA-2004-005 - rev 1

<http://scary.beasts.org/security/CESA-2004-005.txt>

gtk+-2.4.4 XPM image decoder parsing flaws
==========================================

Programs:          gtk+, and any programs which use gtk+ to decode XPM files.
                   For example, Evolution.
Severity:          Compromise of account used to browse malicious XPM file.
CAN identifier(s): CAN-2004-0782, CAN-2004-0783

This advisory lists code flaws discovered by inspection of the XPM parser
within the gtk+ code. Specifically, gtk+-2.4.4 was investigated.

Flaw 1. Heap-based overflow in pixbuf_create_from_xpm (io-xpm.c)
CAN-2004-0782

  name_buf = g_new (gchar, n_col * (cpp + 1));
  colors = g_new (XPMColor, n_col);

Here, n_col is an arbitrary integer value from the XPM. cpp is an integer value
ranging from 1 to 31 from the XPM. By careful choice of values of n_col and
cpp, integer overflow can occur on integer multiplication. This leads to heap
buffers being allocated that cannot hold n_col elements, so a subsequent heap
overflow occurs.

Demo XPM: <http://scary.beasts.org/misc/gdk1.xpm>

Flaw 2. Subtle stack-based overflow in xpm_extract_color (io-xpm.c)
CAN-2004-0783

  gint space = 128;
  gchar word[128], color[128], current_color[128];
...
      if (color[[0]](#0) != '\0') {
        strcat (color, " ");
[*]     space--;
      }
      strncat (color, word, space);
      space -= MIN (space, strlen (word));

Here, an attempt is actually made to prevent overflow of the stack buffers.
However, a logic error means one of the buffers can still be made to overflow.
When "space" reaches 0, "space" can be sent to -1 by the line marked with [*],
if the color string is broken up by whitespace. When "space" is -1, the
strncat() call is effectively morphed to a strcat() call, allowing overflow of
the "color" buffer (probably into the "word" buffer, which may cause a minor
inconvenience to exploitation. Note use of the word "minor" :-)
