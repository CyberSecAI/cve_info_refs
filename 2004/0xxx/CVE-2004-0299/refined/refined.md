The content is related to CVE-2004-0299.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in `smallftpd.exe` due to insufficient bounds checking when processing a long path name string with multiple `../` sequences. The vulnerable code is within `user32.dll`, specifically at `0x77D4CA84`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow.
- Improper handling of long paths containing `../` sequences.
- Lack of input validation/sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS). The application crashes.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending an FTP request with a specially crafted path. The path contains a long string of forward slashes followed by multiple `../` sequences. Example: `ftp://user:pass@127.0.0.1/[464 and more "/" symbols]/../../../`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send an FTP request to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to know valid user credentials or be able to connect to the server anonymously.
