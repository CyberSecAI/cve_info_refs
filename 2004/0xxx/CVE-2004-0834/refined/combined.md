To see if the semaphore is there "but shouldn't be", you can do

        cat /proc/sysvipc/sem

If there is an entry, you can delete it using

        ipcrm sem id

where id is the id from /proc/sysvipc/sem.

Ciao,

Duncan.

PS: Gilles, the IPC semaphores often go wrong for me - it seems to be racy.
I've given up on it and gone back to an earlier version of modem_run.
PPS: David Woodhouse and I have implemented firmware loading in the speedtouch
module, so there will soon be no need to use modem_run with the kernel module.
