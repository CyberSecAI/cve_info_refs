# Usermin: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200406-15**

Usermin contains two security vulnerabilities which could lead to a Denial
of Service attack and information disclosure.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/usermin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.070-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.080** |

### Background

Usermin is a web-based administration tool for Unix. It supports a wide
range of user applications including configuring mail forwarding,
setting up SSH or reading mail.

### Description

Usermin contains two security vulnerabilities. One fails to properly
sanitize email messages that contain malicious HTML or script code and
the other could allow an attacker to lock out a valid user by sending
an invalid username and password.

### Impact

By sending a specially crafted e-mail, an attacker can execute
arbitrary scripts running in the context of the victim's browser. This
can be lead to cookie theft and potentially to compromise of user
accounts. Furthermore, an attacker could lock out legitimate users by
sending invalid login information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version.

### Resolution

Usermin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=app-admin/usermin-1.080"
 # emerge ">=app-admin/usermin-1.080"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-15 14:51:32 UTC  ``` Please bump, new version is available. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Jeremy Huddleston (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-15 15:49:05 UTC  ``` committed.  stable on x86 and sparc.  Just added ~amd64, so no need for that to be stable.  alpha should mark it stable, and we need ppc to mark it stable before GLSA ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-16 06:43:36 UTC  ``` GLSA drafted: security please review.  ppc and alpha please mark stable.  Please remove old unneeded versions from portage.  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-16 09:15:53 UTC  ``` Note that according to :  <http://www.lac.co.jp/security/csl/intelligence/SNSadvisory_e/75_e.html>  usermin is also vulnerable to one of the vulnerabilities in webmin (200406-12) : account lock. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-16 10:45:21 UTC  ``` Thx. Information added to the GLSA. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Bryan Østergaard (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-16 15:14:56 UTC  ``` Stable on alpha. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-18 08:40:26 UTC  ``` Just realised ppc marked stable 2 days ago :) Ready for GLSA publication. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-18 11:33:05 UTC  ``` GLSA 200406-15 ``` |  |
