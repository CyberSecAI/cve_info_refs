## Microsoft Windows processing of zip files contains a buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#649374

Original Release Date: 2004-10-13 | Last Revised: 2004-10-14

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow exists in the way Microsoft Windows processes zip files that may allow remote code execution.

### Description

| Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 feature the ability to natively handle zip files. Microsoft has released bulletin [MS04-034](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-034.mspx) describing a remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability in the way Windows handles zip files. According to [MS04-034](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-034.mspx):  *A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Compressed (zipped) Folders because of an unchecked buffer in the way that it handles specially crafted compressed files. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious compressed file that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.* For further technical information about this vulnerability, please see Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-034](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-034.mspx). |
| --- |

### Impact

| If a remote attacker can persuade a user to access a specially crafted zip file, the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on that user's system, possibly with administrator privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**  Apply a patch as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-034.](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-034.mspx) Please also note that Microsoft is actively deploying the patches for this vulnerability via [Windows Update](http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/). **Do Not Accept Zip Files from Untrusted Sources**Exploitation occurs by accessing a specially crafted zip file (.zip extension). By only accessing zip files from trusted or known sources, the chances of exploitation are reduced. For more details regarding remediation of this issue please see Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-034.](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-034.mspx) |

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces a prior security bulletin. The security bulletin ID and operating systems that are affected are listed in the table below.

| Bulletin ID | Windows XP | Windows Server 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [**MS02-054**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=8139) | Replaced | Not Applicable |

**I'm still using Windows XP, but extended security update support ended on September 30th, 2004. However, this bulletin has a security update for this operating system version. Why is that?**

The original version of Windows XP, commonly known as Windows XP Gold or Windows XP Release to Manufacturing (RTM) version, reached the end of its extended security update support life cycle on September 30, 2004. However, the end-of-life occurred very recently. In this case, the majority of the steps that are required to address this vulnerability were completed before this date. Therefore, we have decided to release a security update for this operating system version as part of this security bulletin.
We do not anticipate doing this for future vulnerabilities that may affect this operating system version, but we reserve the right to produce updates and to make these updates available when necessary. It should be a priority for customers who have this operating system version to migrate to supported operating system versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Service Pack Product Life Cycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?pr=lifesupsps). For more information about the Windows Product Life Cycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA will determine if this update is required. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**Note** After April 20, 2004, the Mssecure.xml file that is used by MBSA 1.1.1 and earlier versions is no longer being updated with new security bulletin data. Therefore, scans that are performed after that date with MBSA 1.1.1 or earlier will be incomplete. All users should upgrade to MBSA 1.2 because it provides more accurate security update detection and supports additional products. Users can download MBSA 1.2 from the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about MBSA support, visit the following [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer 1.2 Q&A; Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33332).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158). SMS can search for the existence of the affected files documented in the Security Update Information section of this bulletin. Update all versions of affected files that are earlier than versions documented in this security bulletin. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

## Vulnerability Details

#### Compressed (zipped) Folders Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0575:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Compressed (zipped) Folders because of an unchecked buffer in the way that it handles specially crafted compressed files. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious compressed file that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for Compressed (zipped) Folders Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0575:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
* By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

  The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

  + Apply the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-040](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=19873) or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
  + Use Internet Explorer 6 or later.
  + Use the Microsoft Outlook E-mail Security Update, use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or later, or use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or later in its default configuration.

#### Workarounds for Compressed (zipped) Folders Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0575:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Remove the registration for Compressed (zipped) Folders, to help protect yourself from the Web based attack vector.**

  To remove the registration for Compressed (zipped) Folders, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regsvr32 /u zipfldr.dll**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. A dialog box appears to confirm that the unregistration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box.
  3. Immediately restart the system.

     **Note:** If .zip files are used in any way before you restart the system, they may automatically restore the registration.

     **Impact of Workaround:** Compressed (zipped) Folder functionality will be unavailable. This will prevent the use of any Compressed (zipped) Folders that have been created. This will not affect any third-party compression applications. To restore this feature, use the same steps provided, but remove â**/u**â from the command line.
* **Install** [**Outlook E-mail Security Update**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) **if you are using Outlook 2000 SP1 or earlier, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002 and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.
* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or later, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or later, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or later and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about enabling this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [307594](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [291387](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
* **Do not open or save .zip files that you receive from untrusted sources.**

  This vulnerability could be exploited when a user views a .zip file. Do not open files that use this file name extension if the files are from untrusted sources. Administrators may want to consider restricting the use of .zip files as email attachments.

#### FAQ for Compressed (zipped) Folders Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0575:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the way that Compressed (zipped) Folders processes specially crafted compressed files.

**What is Compressed (zipped) Folders?**

The Compressed (zipped) Folders feature enables users to store data files and folders in a compressed (or zipped) format. Files and folders that are compressed require less space to store them. The feature lets users create, add files to, and extract files from zipped folders. For more information about Compressed (zipped) Folders, visit the following Microsoft [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/vz_ovrvw.mspx).
Windows also offers another way to compress folders if your drive is formatted as NTFS, [NTFS file compression](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;307987). However, NTFS file compression is significantly different from compressing files by using Compressed (zipped) Folders. To learn more about the similarities and differences between NTFS compression and Compressed (zipped) Folders, visit the following Microsoft [Web site.](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/vz_ovrvw.mspx)

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could host a malicious Web site and then persuade a user to view that Web site. An attacker could also create an e-mail message that contains a specially crafted link, and then persuade a user to view the e-mail message and then click the link. An attacker could also send a specially crafted zipped file to a user and then persuade the user to open the file.

An attacker could also access the affected component through another vector. For example, an attacker could log on to the system interactively or by using another program that passes parameters to the vulnerable component (locally or remotely).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers are only at risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative credentials are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Compressed (zipped) Folders validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

Windows Shell ZIP File Decompression DUNZIP32.DLL Buffer Overflow
Vulnerability

Release Date:
October 12, 2004

Date Reported:
August 2, 2004

Severity:
High (Code Execution)

Vendor:
Microsoft

Systems Affected:
Windows XP (SP1 and earlier)
Windows Me

Overview:
eEye Digital Security has discovered a buffer overflow in DUNZIP32.DLL,
a module that offers support for ZIP compressed folders in the Windows
shell. An exploitable buffer overflow occurs when a user opens a ZIP
folder that contains a long file name.

Technical Details:
This buffer overflow is triggered by an integer overflow. When a ZIP
file containing a long file name (greater than around 0x8000 bytes) is
opened in the Windows shell as a ZIP compressed folder, a stack-based
buffer overflow occurs, allowing an exception handler to be overwritten
and EIP to be hijacked.

Protection:
Retina Network Security Scanner has been updated to identify this
vulnerability.

Vendor Status:
Microsoft has released a patch for this vulnerability. The patch is
available at:
<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-034.mspx>
