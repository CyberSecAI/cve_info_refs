- **Root cause of vulnerability:** rssh expands command-line arguments before entering the chroot jail.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure. rssh expands command-line arguments before entering the chroot jail, allowing users to discover files outside the jail.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can discover the existence of files and directories outside the chrooted jail, if their credentials would normally allow them read/execute access in the specified directory.
- **Attack vectors:** Using `scp` with wildcard characters to access directories outside the chroot jail.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have a valid account on the server restricted by rssh, and read/execute access to the directories they are trying to enumerate.
