Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-0749:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A bug in the `mod_authz_svn` module of Subversion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The `mod_authz_svn` module was leaking metadata related to commits in protected areas. This included commit logs, paths, and file versions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could gain information about protected areas of a Subversion repository, including the existence of certain paths, file versions, and commit logs, even without having access to the protected files themselves. This information could be used to further plan attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- The specific attack vector is through the use of the vulnerable `mod_authz_svn` module in conjunction with an Apache webserver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with a Subversion repository that uses the vulnerable `mod_authz_svn` module for path-based access control.
- No specific user privilege on the repository seems to be required for exploitation, other than the ability to reach the exposed repository.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability lies in the fact that `mod_authz_svn` was leaking metadata, which should have been protected, related to commits in restricted parts of Subversion repositories.
