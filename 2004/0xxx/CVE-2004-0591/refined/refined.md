Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-0591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `print_header_uc()` function within SqWebMail (part of the Courier suite) not properly sanitizing or filtering user-supplied data from email headers before displaying them in the web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Injection:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary script code in the victim's browser window.
- **Session Hijacking:** By executing malicious Javascript, attackers can steal session cookies which can lead to session hijacking or account compromise.
- **Application Modification:**  The injected code can modify the behavior of the SqWebMail application, potentially leading to further malicious actions.
- **Data Leakage:** Attackers can leak session information, like cookies.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed Email Headers:** An attacker can send an email with crafted headers containing malicious JavaScript code. This is specifically effective when full headers are displayed within SqWebMail.
- **Malformed MIME Content-Type:** An email with `Content-Type` set to `message/delivery-status` and malicious content can also trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send Emails:** The attacker needs the capability to send emails to a user who uses the vulnerable SqWebMail application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know of the XSS vulnerability.
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not need access to the server, just a way to send emails to the target user.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was identified in SqWebMail version 4.0.4.20040524.
- The issue was fixed in SqWebMail 4.0.5 and Courier version 0.45.6.20040618.
- The `print_header_uc()` function in `folder.c` was identified as the vulnerable code.
- The vulnerability was reported by Luca Legato from Mediaservice.net.
- Two specific attack vectors, sending malformed headers and malformed MIME content-type headers, are mentioned.
- The vulnerability was addressed relatively quickly by the vendor.

This analysis provides more specific details about the vulnerability and attack vectors than what is typically present in a standard CVE description.
