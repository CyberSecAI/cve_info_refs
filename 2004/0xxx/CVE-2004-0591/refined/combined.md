How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Courier: Cross-site scripting vulnerability in SqWebMail — GLSA **200408-02**

The SqWebMail web application, included in the Courier suite, is vulnerable
to cross-site scripting attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-mta/courier** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.45.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.45.6.20040618** |

### Background

Courier is an integrated mail and groupware server based on open protocols.
It provides ESMTP, IMAP, POP3, webmail, and mailing list services within a
single framework. The webmail functionality included in Courier called
SqWebMail allows you to access mailboxes from a web browser.

### Description

Luca Legato found that SqWebMail is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack. An XSS attack allows an attacker to insert malicious code
into a web-based application. SqWebMail doesn't filter appropriately data
coming from message headers before displaying them.

### Impact

By sending a carefully crafted message, an attacker can inject and execute
script code in the victim's browser window. This allows to modify the
behaviour of the SqWebMail application, and/or leak session information
such as cookies to the attacker.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version of Courier.

### Resolution

All Courier users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=mail-mta/courier-0.45.6.20040618"
 # emerge ">=mail-mta/courier-0.45.6.20040618"
```

Hello Bugtraq,

Sqwebmail (<http://www.inter7.com/sqwebmail/>) is a web cgi client for
sending and receiving email using Maildir mailboxes.

During a web application security evaluation on Sqwebmail 4.0.4.20040524
we have found a XSS (Cross Site Scripting) vulnerability inside the
print_header_uc() function (from folder.c). This flaw can be exploited by
a remote attacker using two vectors:

1) sending a raw email message with malformed headers, i.e.
"<script>alert(document.location)</script>":

ashanti@dns:~$ telnet localhost 25
Trying x.x.x.x...
Connected to x.x.x.x.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 x.x.x.x ESMTP
helo foo
250 x.x.x.x
mail from:<test@test.com>
250 ok
rcpt to:<user@mediaservice.net>
250 ok
data
354 go ahead
<script>alert(document.location)</script>
.
[...]

This works only if Sqwebmail is configured to display the full headers
(via prefences or via fullheaders cgi variable).

2) sending a raw email message with the MIME Content-Type header set to
"message/delivery-status" with malformed content (see 1 above).

According to our fast examination of the source code, these are the only
two calls to the vulnerable print_header_uc() fuction that take their
argument from user input (i.e. from the content of email messages): since
this function doesn't properly filter for "malicious" data (like '<', '>',
'&', and so on), by sending a carefully-crafted email message an attacker
is able to inject and execute arbitrary code in the client browser context
-- this security flaw effectively enables an attacker to steal sensitive
session information.

Inter7 and Sam Varshavchik (the author and current mantainer) were both
contacted on June 11. On the same day, the author released Sqwebmail
4.0.5, that addresses the reported vulnerability. All Sqwebmail users are
encouraged to upgrade to this latest version.
