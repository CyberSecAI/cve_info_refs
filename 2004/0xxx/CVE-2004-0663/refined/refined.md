The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in PowerPortal v1.x, a content management system. It does not provide a CVE description but details the vulnerabilities.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **A. Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application displays the full server path in error messages when invalid input is provided to certain scripts (e.g., `resize.php`, `index.php`).
    *   **Weakness:** Improper error handling, lack of sanitization or masking of internal paths.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows a remote attacker to learn the server's directory structure, potentially revealing sensitive information or aiding in more complex attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending requests with malformed data to specific PHP scripts.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker.

*   **B. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input in various modules (`private_messages`, `links`, `content`, `gallery`).
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization/validation.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application which are then executed in the context of other users' browsers. This can be used to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the website.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting specific URLs with malicious JavaScript payloads in the vulnerable parameters.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker.

*   **C. Arbitrary Directory Browsing:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize the `files` parameter in the `gallery` module, allowing directory traversal using `../`.
    *  **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization/validation.
    *   **Impact:** Allows a remote attacker to browse any directory on the server that the web server process has access to.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Modifying the `files` parameter in the request to navigate through the file system.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that vendors were contacted, and a fix was planned, suggesting that these are known issues to the developers.
*   The advisory includes specific examples of how to exploit these vulnerabilities.
* The report is from 2004
