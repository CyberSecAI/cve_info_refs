## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Why has Microsoft re-issued this bulletin?**

Microsoft re-issued this bulletin on August 10, 2004 to advise on the availability of a security update for Microsoft INTERIX 2.2. Subsequent to the release of this bulletin, it was determined that the vulnerability addressed also affects this product. Microsoft has updated the bulletin with additional information about Microsoft INTERIX 2.2 and also to direct users to a security update for this product. Customers who are not using Microsoft INTERIX 2.2 and have previously installed the security updates provided as part of the original release of this bulletin do not need to install the new security update.

**I'm still using Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Service Pack 6a or Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, but extended security update support ended on June 30, 2004. However, this bulletin has a security update for these operating system versions. Why is that?**

Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Service Pack 6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 have reached the end of their life cycles as previously documented, and Microsoft extended this support to June 30, 2004. However, the end-of-life for the extended support period occurred very recently. In this case, the majority of the steps that are required to address this vulnerability were completed before June 30, 2004. Therefore, we have decided to release security updates for these operating system versions as part of this security bulletin. We do not anticipate doing this for future vulnerabilities affecting these operating system versions, but we reserve the right to produce updates and to make these updates available when necessary.

It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to future vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Life Cycle, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these operating system versions, visit the following [Microsoft Product Support Services Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;%5bln%5d;lifeanoct2003).

Customers who require additional support for Windows NT Workstation 4.0 SP6a must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/), select the country, and then click **Go** to see a list of phone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager.

For more information, see the [Windows Operating System FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;%5bln%5d;lifewinfaq).

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA will determine if this update is required. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**Note** After April 20, 2004, the Mssecure.xml file that is used by MBSA 1.1.1 and earlier versions is no longer being updated with new security bulletin data. Therefore, scans that are performed after that date with MBSA 1.1.1 or earlier will be incomplete. All users should upgrade to MBSA 1.2 because it provides more accurate security update detection and supports additional products. Users can download MBSA 1.2 from the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about MBSA support, visit the following [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsaqa.mspx)[1.2 Q&A; Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsaqa.mspx).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

## Vulnerability Details

#### POSIX Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0210

A [privilege elevation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in the POSIX subsystem. This vulnerability could allow a logged on user to take complete control of the system.

#### Mitigating Factors for POSIX Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0210:

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to logon locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
* Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 are not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for POSIX Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0210:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Disable the POSIX subsystem through the registry**

  This workaround is fully documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [101270](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;101270). This article is summarized in the following paragraphs.

  The following steps demonstrate how to disable the POSIX subsystem.

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  **Note** We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regedt32**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. In Registry Editor, locate the following registry key:

     `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Subsystems\Posix`
  3. Click the **POSIX** data value, click **Edit**, and then click **Delete**.
  4. Click **OK** to confirm the delete, and then restart the system.

     **Note** To enable the POSIX subsystem, re-create the registry key. The name if the registry key is **Posix**, the type of registry key is **REG\_EXPAND\_SZ**, and the registry key value is **%SystemRoot%\system32\psxss.exe**. After you have done this, restart the system.

  **Impact of Workaround:** POSIX programs are disabled until the POSIX subsystem is enabled.

#### FAQ for POSIX Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0210:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [privilege elevation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the POSIX subsystem.

**What is the POSIX subsystem?**

You can run applications that are created for the Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX (POSIX) standard under Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000. The operating systems provide support for nonnative applications by emulating the environments in which they are designed to be processed. This support is provided through environment subsystems. Except for the Microsoft Win32 subsystem, which is the native environment of Windows, each environment is optional and is used only when a client application requires its services. For more information about POSIX support, visit the following [MSDN Library Web Site](https://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/techinfo/reskit/default.asp?url=/windows2000/techinfo/reskit/prork/pric_run_snrr.asp).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must be able to log on locally to a system that has the POSIX subsystem enabled.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially-designed program that could attempt to exploit the vulnerability, and thereby gain complete control over the affected system.

An attacker could also access the affected component through another vector. For example, an attacker could use another program that passes parameters to the vulnerable component (locally or remotely).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 systems are at risk from this vulnerability. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 do not contain the POSIX subsystem. For more information about the support of POSIX in Windows XP and in Windows Server 2003, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [308259](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;308259).

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers are only at risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative credentials are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

No. An attacker must be able to log on to the specific system that is targeted for attack. An attacker cannot load and run a program remotely by exploiting this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the POSIX subsystem validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

However, if the required services cannot be stopped for any reason or if required files are in use, this update will require a restart. If this occurs, a message appears that advises you to restart.

**Removal Information**

To remove this security update, use the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

System administrators can also use the Hotfix.exe utility to remove this security update. The Hotfix.exe utility is located in the %Windir%\$NTUninstallKB841872$ folder. The Hotfix.exe utility supports the following setup switches:

**Verifying Update Installation**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. This tool allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results pane**, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name box**, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Hotfix\KB841872\File 1

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 841872 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and to perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, see the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, see the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
