# MPlayer, xine-lib: vulnerabilities in RTSP stream handling — GLSA **200405-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities, including remotely exploitable buffer overflows,
have been found in code common to MPlayer and the xine library.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/mplayer** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0\_pre4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0\_pre4**<= **0.92-r1** |

| Package | **media-libs/xine-lib** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1\_rc4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1\_rc4**<= **0.9.13-r3** |

### Background

MPlayer is a movie player capable of handling multiple multimedia file
formats. xine-lib is a multimedia player library used by several graphical
user interfaces, including xine-ui. They both use the same code to handle
Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) streams from RealNetworks servers.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found and fixed in the RTSP handling
code common to recent versions of these two packages. These vulnerabilities
include several remotely exploitable buffer overflows.

### Impact

A remote attacker, posing as a RTSP stream server, can execute arbitrary
code with the rights of the user of the software playing the stream
(MPlayer or any player using xine-lib). Another attacker may entice a user
to use a maliciously crafted URL or playlist to achieve the same results.

### Workaround

For MPlayer, there is no known workaround at this time. For xine-lib, you
can delete the xineplug\_inp\_rtsp.so file.

### Resolution

All users should upgrade to non-vulnerable versions of MPlayer and
xine-lib:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_pre4"
 # emerge ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_pre4"

 # emerge -pv ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1_rc4"
 # emerge ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1_rc4"
```
