      "details": "The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used to alert hosts on a network about certain situations. The RFC recommends no security checking for in-bound ICMP messages, so long as a related connection exists, and may potentially allow several different Denials of Service.\n\nAn ICMP Source Quench attack is reported, which exploits the specification that a host must react to ICMP Source Quench messages by slowing transmission on the associated connection. A remote attacker may effectively degrade performance for a legitimate connection.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0791 to this issue.",

Thus, an attacker could send ICMP Source Quench (type 4, code 0) messages to a TCP endpoint to make it reduce the rate at which it sends data to the other party.
