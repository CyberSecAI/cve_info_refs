The provided content is a security bulletin from HP detailing a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in HP Integrated Lights-Out (iLO) firmware.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the use of TCP/IP reserved port zero when accessing an Integrated Lights-Out (iLO) in a ProLiant server. The iLO becomes unresponsive when accessed using port zero, which is a reserved port according to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The iLO firmware incorrectly handles connections using TCP/IP port zero, which is a reserved port, causing a DoS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial of service, rendering the iLO management interface unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is any LAN management product that uses port zero when accessing iLO in a ProLiant server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the iLO using port zero. The attacker would need to be on the same network or have network access to the iLO.

**Affected versions:**
iLO Firmware V1.10 or Later up to, but not including, V1.55.
