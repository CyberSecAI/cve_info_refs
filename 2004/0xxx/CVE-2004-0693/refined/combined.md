Package        : qt-copy
Vulnerability  : unsanitised input
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0691 CAN-2004-0692 CAN-2004-0693
Debian Bug     : 267092

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in recent versions of Qt, a
commonly used graphic widget set, used in KDE for example.  The first
problem allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, while the other
two only seem to pose a denial of service danger.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:

CAN-2004-0691:

    Chris Evans has discovered a heap-based overflow when handling
    8-bit RLE encoded BMP files.

CAN-2004-0692:

    Marcus Meissner has discovered a crash condition in the XPM
    handling code, which is not yet fixed in Qt 3.3.

CAN-2004-0693:

    Marcus Meissner has discovered a crash condition in the GIF
    handling code, which is not yet fixed in Qt 3.3.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.3-20020329-1woody2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.3-4 of qt-x11-free.

We recommend that you upgrade your qt packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# Qt: Image loader overflows — GLSA **200408-20**

There are several bugs in Qt's image-handling code which could lead to
crashes or arbitrary code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-libs/qt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **3.3.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.3.3** |

### Background

Qt is a cross-platform GUI toolkit used by KDE.

### Description

There are several unspecified bugs in the QImage class which may cause
crashes or allow execution of arbitrary code as the user running the Qt
application. These bugs affect the PNG, XPM, BMP, GIF and JPEG image
types.

### Impact

An attacker may exploit these bugs by causing a user to open a
carefully-constructed image file in any one of these formats. This may
be accomplished through e-mail attachments (if the user uses KMail), or
by simply placing a malformed image on a website and then convicing the
user to load the site in a Qt-based browser (such as Konqueror).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version of Qt.

### Resolution

All Qt users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=x11-libs/qt-3.3.3"
 # emerge ">=x11-libs/qt-3.3.3"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-18 23:58:36 UTC  ``` Mandrake released the following:   ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-18 23:58:36 UTC  ``` Mandrake released the following:   Problem Description:     Chris Evans discovered a heap-based overflow in the QT library when    handling 8-bit RLE encoded BMP files. This vulnerability could allow    for the compromise of the account used to view or browse malicious    BMP files. On subsequent investigation, it was also found that the    handlers for XPM, GIF, and JPEG image types were also faulty.        These problems affect all applications that use QT to handle image    files, such as QT-based image viewers, the Konqueror web browser,    and others. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 00:02:13 UTC  ``` Not much info yet.  kde please verify wether 3.3.3 solves this problem?  I'm not sure that the lines below from the Changelog fixes this problem:  - QImage         Included fix for buffer overflow in libPNG.         Fixed bug that made copy constructor not copy the entire image.         Allow XPM images with colors that have more than one word in the         name.         Fixed crash when trying to load a corrupt/invalid BMP image.         Fixed crash when trying to load a corrupt/invalid GIF image.         Fixed crash when trying to load a JPEG image that is too big.         Fixed bug that caused dotsPerMeter() to be ignored when saving         JPEG images. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Carsten Lohrke (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 04:47:03 UTC  ``` Yes it is the libpng issue. Arch teams, please mark stable. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Aron Griffis (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 05:25:44 UTC  ``` Please clarify what needs to be marked stable. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Caleb Tennis (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 05:51:43 UTC  ``` I know nothing of this bug, nor do I know if 3.3.3 has the fix for it.  I've heard nothing from the Qt developers on the matter.  Also, my recommendation to the arches is to not just blindly bump this to stable as we don't know enough if 3.3.3 introduces any "regressions" yet from 3.3.2, particularly to KDE. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Carsten Lohrke (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 06:05:36 UTC  ``` Sorry Caleb, but I went ahead for x86 already. Chris Evans discovered vulnerabilities in libpng lately (<http://secunia.com/advisories/12219/>) and I guess this is just part of what he found. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 07:15:20 UTC  ``` Back to ebuild status and uncc'ing arches.  It's not entirely clear what Mandrake patched but it appears that qt 3.3.3 contains security fixes. Caleb will you look into this?   If qt 3.3.2 is vulnerable to the libpng issue we need to bump to 3.3.3 or a patched version. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Marc Ballarin    2004-08-19 09:11:46 UTC  ``` It's the libpng bug + several bugs in QT itself. Affected are BMP, XPM and JPEG. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Marc Ballarin    2004-08-19 09:18:39 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 37737](attachment.cgi?id=37737 "Patch ripped from Suse's SRPM") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=37737&action=edit "Patch ripped from Suse's SRPM"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=37737&action=diff "Patch ripped from Suse's SRPM")] Patch ripped from Suse's SRPM  Applies against 3.3.2 with a few offsets. Not compile tested. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Chris White (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 10:02:14 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 60902](show_bug.cgi?id=60902 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Heap overflow in qt-3.3x and qt-3.2.x") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Pieter Van den Abeele (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 11:52:42 UTC  ``` Hi,  what needs to be marked stable?  Pieter ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Pieter Van den Abeele (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 13:22:04 UTC  ``` If qt-3.3.3 turns out to have the fixes, it can go stable on ppc. I've tested it. ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Carsten Lohrke (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 13:27:36 UTC  ``` Qt-3.3.3 has the fixes, but there's still Caleb's veto, because Trolltech didn't announced anything yet. ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 19:42:49 UTC  ``` they didnt announce it but if you review the changelog as noted in [Bug 60902](show_bug.cgi?id=60902 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Heap overflow in qt-3.3x and qt-3.2.x"): <http://www.trolltech.com/developer/changes/changes-3.3.3.html>  it, at the very least, mentions the libpng bug ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Gustavo Zacarias (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-20 08:10:51 UTC  ``` qt-3.3.3 looks good on sparc, but i'll wait for caleb/weeve's take on this one.  ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Caleb Tennis (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-20 08:16:27 UTC  ``` The bump to stable is fine with me - I just wanted to make sure that people understand that there have been instances before where upgrading to a new minor version of Qt caused problems with KDE installations which required a re-emerge of kde - and a lot of end user griping :) ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Gustavo Zacarias (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-20 08:38:22 UTC  ``` Okie dokie, sparc stable then.  ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Pieter Van den Abeele (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-20 08:58:12 UTC  ``` stable on ppc ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Tom Gall (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-20 10:30:20 UTC  ``` stable on ppc64 ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Danny van Dyk (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-20 10:42:07 UTC  ``` stable on amd64 ```  [Comment 21](#c21)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2004-08-20 17:34:23 UTC  ``` hppa stable ```  [Comment 22](#c22)  Bryan Østergaard (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-20 23:50:11 UTC  ``` Stable on alpha. ```  [Comment 23](#c23)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-21 07:44:05 UTC  ``` This is ready for GLSA.
