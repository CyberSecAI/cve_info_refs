-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Summary:       Potential Buffer Overruns in Samba 3.0 and Samba 2.2
CVE ID:        CAN-2004-0600, CAN-2004-0686
~               (<http://cve.mitre.org/>)

- -------------
CAN-2004-0600
- -------------

Affected Versions:      >= v3.0.2

The internal routine used by the Samba Web Administration
Tool (SWAT v3.0.2 and later) to decode the base64 data
during HTTP basic authentication is subject to a buffer
overrun caused by an invalid base64 character.  It is
recommended that all Samba v3.0.2 or later installations
running SWAT either (a) upgrade to v3.0.5, or (b) disable
the swat administration service as a temporary workaround.

This same code is used internally to decode the
sambaMungedDial attribute value when using the ldapsam
passdb backend. While we do not believe that the base64
decoding routines used by the ldapsam passdb backend can
be exploited, sites using an LDAP directory service with
Samba are strongly encouraged to verify that the DIT only
allows write access to sambaSamAccount attributes by a
sufficiently authorized user.

The Samba Team would like to heartily thank Evgeny Demidov
for analyzing and reporting this bug.

- -------------
CAN-2004-0686
- -------------

Affected Versions:      >= v2.2.9, >= v3.0.0

A buffer overrun has been located in the code used to support
the 'mangling method = hash' smb.conf option.  Please be aware
that the default setting for this parameter in Samba 3 is
'mangling method = hash2' and therefore not vulnerable.

Affected Samba installations can avoid this possible security
bug by using the hash2 mangling method.  Server installations
requiring the hash mangling method are encouraged to upgrade
to Samba 3.0.5 (or 2.2.10).

~              --------------------------------------

Samba 3.0.5 and 2.2.10 are identical to the previous release
in each respective series with the exception of fixing these
issues. Samba 3.0.5rc1 has been removed from the download area
on Samba.org and 3.0.6rc2 will be available later this week.

The source code can be downloaded from :

~  <http://download.samba.org/samba/ftp/>

The uncompressed tarball and patch file have been signed
using GnuPG.  The Samba public key is available at

~  <http://download.samba.org/samba/ftp/samba-pubkey.asc>

 Summary:           Multiple Potential Buffer Overruns
 Advisory ID:       TSSA-2004-014
 Date:              2004-07-23
 Affected versions: tinysofa enterprise server 1.0

 Security Fixes
 ==============

 Description
 -----------

  samba:
  * Samba [[0]](#0) is an Open Source/Free Software suite that provides seamless
    file and print services to SMB/CIFS clients.

  [Issue #1]

    The internal routine used by the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT
    v3.0.2 and later) to decode the base64 data during HTTP basic
    authentication is subject to a buffer overrun caused by an invalid
    base64 character.

    This same code is used internally to decode the sambaMungedDial
    attribute value when using the ldapsam passdb backend.

    Sites using an LDAP directory service with Samba are strongly encouraged
    to verify that the DIT only allows write access to sambaSamAccount
    attributes by a sufficiently authorized user.

    This problem has been assigned the name CAN-2004-0600 [[1]](#1) by the
    Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project, and was first
    reported by Evgeny Demidov.

  [Issue #2]

    A buffer overrun has been located in the code used to support
    the 'mangling method = hash' smb.conf option. The default setting
    for this parameter is 'mangling method = hash2' and therefore a
    default Samba configuration is not vulnerable.

    This problem has been assigned the name CAN-2004-0686 [[2]](#2) by the
    Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project.

SSRT4782 rev. 0 HP-UX CIFS Server potential remote root access

 -----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTICE:
 There are no restrictions for distribution of this Bulletin
 provided that it remains complete and intact.

 The information in this Security bulletin should be acted upon
 as soon as possible.

INITIAL RELEASE:    26 July 2004

POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:    remote root access

SOURCE:    HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY
HP Software Security Response Team

REFERENCES:    CAN-2004-0686

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP-UX
running the CIFS Server.  This buffer overflow could potentially
be exploited remotely to gain root access.

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.11, B.11.22, B.11.23.
BACKGROUND:

AFFECTED VERSIONS

Note: To determine if a system has an affected version,
      search the output of "swlist -a revision -l fileset"
      for an affected fileset.  Then determine if the
      recommended patch or update is installed.

HP-UX B.11.23
HP-UX B.11.22
HP-UX B.11.11
HP-UX B.11.00
=============
For revision A.01.11.01 and previous:
CIFS-Server
action: Please see the Resolution section.

END AFFECTED VERSIONS

Note: The HP CIFS Server versions do not map directly to
         original Samba versions.  The what(1) output will show
         the HP version string, for example: A.01.11.02.  Samba
         commands such as "smbd -V" or "smbstatus" will report the
         underlying base Samba version, for example: 2.2.10.

Note: The HP CIFS Server versions A.01.11.02 and previous are
      not affected by the vulnerability reported in CAN-2004-0600.

RESOLUTION:
Until an update is available the potential vulnerability can
be avoided by setting "mangling method = hash2" or
"mangled names = no" in smb.conf.

Note: CIFS Server installations requiring the hash mangling
          method must evaluate the impact of converting to the
          hash2 mangling method.

MANUAL ACTIONS:  Yes - NonUpdate
Until a product update is available, modify smb.conf as described
in the Resolution section.

# Samba: Multiple buffer overflows — GLSA **200407-21**

Two buffer overflows vulnerabilities were found in Samba, potentially
allowing the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-fs/samba** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **3.0.4-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.0.5** |

### Background

Samba is a package which allows \*nix systems to act as file servers for
Windows computers. It also allows \*nix systems to mount shares exported by
a Samba/CIFS/Windows server. The Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) is a
web-based configuration tool part of the Samba package.

### Description

Evgeny Demidov found a buffer overflow in SWAT, located in the base64 data
decoder used to handle HTTP basic authentication (CAN-2004-0600). The same
flaw is present in the code used to handle the sambaMungedDial attribute
value, when using the ldapsam passdb backend. Another buffer overflow was
found in the code used to support the 'mangling method = hash' smb.conf
option (CAN-2004-0686). Note that the default Samba value for this option
is 'mangling method = hash2' which is not vulnerable.

### Impact

The SWAT authentication overflow could be exploited to execute arbitrary
code with the rights of the Samba daemon process. The overflow in the
sambaMungedDial handling code is not thought to be exploitable. The buffer
overflow in 'mangling method = hash' code could also be used to execute
arbitrary code on vulnerable configurations.

### Workaround

Users disabling SWAT, not using ldapsam passdb backends and not using the
'mangling method = hash' option are not vulnerable.

### Resolution

All Samba users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-fs/samba-3.0.5"
 # emerge ">=net-fs/samba-3.0.5"
```

Package:             samba
Vulnerability:       arbitrary code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= samba-3.0.4-20040722     >= samba-3.0.5-20040722

OpenPKG 2.0          <= samba-2.2.8a-2.0.0       >= samba-2.2.8a-2.0.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Evgeny Demidov discovered that the Samba SMB/CIFS server [[1]](#1) has a
  buffer overflow bug in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) on
  decoding Base64 data during HTTP Basic Authentication. Samba version
  between 3.0.2 through 3.0.4 are affected. The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2004-0600 [[2]](#2) to the
  problem.

  Another buffer overflow bug has been located in the Samba code
  used to support the "mangling method = hash" functionality. The
  default setting for this parameter is "mangling method = hash2"
  and therefore Samba is not vulnerable by default. Samba versions
  between 2.2.0 through 2.2.9 and 3.0.0 through 3.0.4 are affected. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2004-0686 [[3]](#3) to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  samba". If you have the "samba" package installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). [4][[5]](#5)

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [6][[7]](#7), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [8][[9]](#9) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[10]](#10), build a corresponding binary
  RPM from it [[4]](#4) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [[5]](#5). For the current release OpenPKG 2.1, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.1/UPD
  ftp> get samba-3.0.4-2.1.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig samba-3.0.4-2.1.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild samba-3.0.4-2.1.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/samba-3.0.4-2.1.1.*.rpm

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
