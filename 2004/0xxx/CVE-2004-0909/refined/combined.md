### Background

Mozilla is a popular web browser that includes a mail and newsreader.
Epiphany is a web browser that uses Gecko, the Mozilla rendering
engine. Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird are respectively the
next-generation browser and mail client from the Mozilla project.

### Description

Mozilla-based products are vulnerable to multiple security issues.
Firstly routines handling the display of BMP images and VCards contain
an integer overflow and a stack buffer overrun. Specific pages with
long links, when sent using the "Send Page" function, and links with
non-ASCII hostnames could both cause heap buffer overruns.

Several issues were found and fixed in JavaScript rights handling:
untrusted script code could read and write to the clipboard, signed
scripts could build confusing grant privileges dialog boxes, and when
dragged onto trusted frames or windows, JavaScript links could access
information and rights of the target frame or window. Finally,
Mozilla-based mail clients (Mozilla and Mozilla Thunderbird) are
vulnerable to a heap overflow caused by invalid POP3 mail server
responses.

### Impact

An attacker might be able to run arbitrary code with the rights of the
user running the software by enticing the user to perform one of the
following actions: view a specially-crafted BMP image or VCard, use the
"Send Page" function on a malicious page, follow links with malicious
hostnames, drag multiple JavaScript links in a row to another window,
or connect to an untrusted POP3 mail server. An attacker could also use
a malicious page with JavaScript to disclose clipboard contents or
abuse previously-given privileges to request XPI installation
privileges through a confusing dialog.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround covering all vulnerabilities.

### Resolution

All users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv your-version
 # emerge your-version
```

Scripts calling enablePrivilege can change the meaning of setences in the dialog
by passing a parameter with spaces and English words.
As usual for enablePrivilege dialog holes, exploitation requires signing your
script. ActiveX spyware reminds us that this is not an effective deterrent.

Suggested fix:
A) Maintain a map from jargony privilege names to sentences describing them.
For example, "A site has requested UniversalXPConnect privileges" becomes "A
site has requested: \* Permission to install software on your computer". Do not
allow sites to request privileges that are not in the map.
OR
B) Don't distinguish requests for different privileges in the UI.

Attached patch

[de-jargonize the enable privilege dialog (trunk)](attachment.cgi?id=156234&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=156234&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=253942&attachment=156234)

This patch takes Jesse's approach "A" and de-jargonizes the capabilities
request. It also reformats the request dialog to put each capability on its own
line, and if the capability requested is not a known standard one (other apps
could define their own capabilities) then the raw capability is printed.
Since I reworded the dialog I went ahead and incorporated a fix for [bug 253944](/show_bug.cgi?id=253944 "VERIFIED FIXED - enablePrivilege dialog uses \"Yes\" and \"No\" as button labels"),
changing the button text to "Allow" and "Deny". I reused the existing Yes No
strings from caps.properties so that the dialog will degrade somewhat
gracefully in locales that don't incorporate these changes right away.
I'm open to suggestion on the wording, especially the capability descriptions.
This is a trunk patch. The aviary patch is identical except caps.properties was
moved under toolkit/locales and trivial line number shifting.

The demo in [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=253942#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - enablePrivilege parameter can change the meaning of the dialog") looks funny with this patch applied. Every word of "that
you dance around..." is on line of its own.

The demo looks funny because it's a hack attempt. Much more obvious something
strange is going on than in the original screenshot. Normally a single
preference would be requested, or a small group (two or three). Legit cases
won't look so bad. Hopefully in cases that /do/ look this bad people will have
the sense to deny it (how many people would figure out from the original screen
shot that clicking "Yes" would grant the attacker full 0wnership of the
victim's machine?).

These should just be the same as UniversalXPConnect, since you can use them to
install software IIRC.

That doesn't sound secure. Can we make apps supply descriptions, and
automatically deny a request for a security setting we don't know about?

The problem with putting this on 1.7.3 is that it is a translation hit - in this
case, it doesn't break anything (because there isn't new entries in the
properties files) ... what do other people think?

I could go either way on fixing this in 1.7
I don't want to give prefs identical strings, it would be confusing when they
are asked for at the same time (for example, to modify capability prefs you need
both CapabilityPreferencesAccess and UniversalPreferencesWrite).
I could beef up the Capability string. I don't see how UniversalPreferencesWrite
could let an attacker install software directly, but it can mess things up.
(could add a site to the xpi whitelist, but they'd still get the xpi
confirmation dialog. Could redirect the update url, though, which people would
probably trust. Could lower anti-spoofing settings, allow popups, etc.)
> How juicy is information in Firefox or Seamonkey prefs?
Pretty juicy from a privacy standpoint. Home page, specific directories on disk,
mail account info, titles of most recently edited docs. Extensions can be worse:
aim password (lightly scrambled), irc startup URLS (which might have channel
keys or passwords), adbock rexexps, etc.

Creating such an API would take time to get right, and then no one is likely to
use it. I'd rather just get this in because I think it solves the problem.
Easier would be just to deny any unknown privilege, but the current code only
knows whether a property string is defined for that privilege or not. Signed
scripts (not that there are (m)any) would be broken in localizations until they
caught up.

I see 3 ways to 0wn the user directly:
browser.throbber.url
update.app.url
update.extensions.autoUpdate
security.dialog\_enable\_delay
and 3 ways to spoof so effectively that the user is effectively 0wned:
browser.chromeURL
dom.disable\_window\_open\_feature.titlebar
network.proxy.autoconfig\_url
network.proxy.http

When a script requests CapabilityPreferencesAccess and
UniversalPreferencesWrite, only show "Run or install software on your machine" once.

It doesn't solve the problem. Scripts could request a priv containing a
character that looks like a space, use a language like Japanese where spaces can
be omitted, or use a language like Japanese where vertical text is allowed.
Scripts could request "UniversalPreferencesRead but not UniversalXPConnect" and
it wouldn't be obvious that clicking "Allow" grants the ability to install software.

mkaply suggested: on the 1.7 branch, hard-code English strings and use those if
the properties string is missing.

Attached file
[testcase with non-ascii char in privilege name](attachment.cgi?id=157308)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=157308&action=edit)

It turns out a script cannot request a privilege that looks like Japanese
([comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=253942#c13 "VERIFIED FIXED - enablePrivilege parameter can change the meaning of the dialog")). The API uses "string" (which is supposed to be 7-bit ascii) but
then throws it through the utf8 converter which fails and results in an empty
string in the dialog. You can ask for anything this way and the user wouldn't
know what.

[Original demo minus apostrophe in privilege name](attachment.cgi?id=157310)

To address part of Jesse's concerns in [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=253942#c13 "VERIFIED FIXED - enablePrivilege parameter can change the meaning of the dialog") I've restricted the set of
valid characters in capability names to alphanums plus the delimiters '\_', '-',
and '.'
Our built-in prefs use StudlyCaps and custom prefs most likely follow that
example, but it seemed safer to allow the other word break styles (all can be
found in Mozilla code) rather than break some custom app built on 1.7

I didn't reword any of the capability descriptions, but I did beef up the
warnings on the surrouding dialog (I hope). If people ignore the warnings that
are already there then repeating "can be used to install software" over and
over won't help.

Hm, how about:
A script from "%S" is requesting the following enhanced abilities which are
potentially unsafe:\n\n%S\n\nYou should allow these only if you trust the
source to be free of viruses or malicious programs.
Rationale:
- The sites I trust are not "UNSAFE".
- Some users would not install software from that source because they don't
have the priveleges to do so on a machine, so I removed that bit. Plus, it
really doesn't need to be there IMO.

Do we really need this assertion? Presumably, in the already unlikely event
we have a dropped in XPCOM string impl, which changes kNotFound, they probably
also have fixed the Find() methods to return the right thing. But maybe it
would just help to #undef and re-#define it to the right thing
Nit: If this gets left in, remove the space after the open parenthesis.

I like this approach. I think the one thing I'd suggest is prepending
"Unknown: " or something to anything we don't know about. That would impose an
extra l10n requirement, but I think that would make it clearer that we don't
have a bunch of random things as possible capabilities.

Fixes nits, displays extended caps as "Unknown: <foo>". This isn't too
friendly to any extensions that create these, but I suspect no one uses this
and we can fix the word later if anyone comes up with anything (or add the
capability definition to caps.properties).
In warning dialog I left the wording of the first sentence. The capabilities
ARE unsafe whether you trust the site or not. That's where the trust comes in,
you are trusting the site to handle them responsibly. We don't need to minimize
the danger, if anything people don't pay enough attention when presented with
dialogs of this type.
I removed the reference to installing in the second sentence to tighten things
up.

We can't take this change in 1.7 if it affects a translated property file.
We need to come up with some way to fix this for 1.7 that doesn't affect
translation, or if it affects translation, it has to work if those new strings
in caps.properties don't exist.

Address brendan's nit
No, this patch cannot be used for the 1.7.x branch.
We must have a patch for the branch that doesn't involve changing .properties
files, even if it requires hardcoding english in this case.

Address brendan's nit
This patch works absolutely FINE without a changed caps file. it's not quite as
good that way but it still helps the problem a bit by putting each privilege on
a separate line and screening out bogus chars.

## Mozilla allows signed scripts calling "enablePrivilege" to change contents of a "grant" dialog

#### Vulnerability Note VU#113192

Original Release Date: 2004-09-17 | Last Revised: 2004-10-26

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way Mozilla and its derived programs display dialogs in some circumstances could allow a remote attacker to install and run software on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The [Mozilla web browser](http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/) and related [Mozilla products](http://www.mozilla.org/products/) support the ability to run [signed scripts](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/signed-scripts.html) supplied in HTML email or webpages. A signed script can request expanded privileges that give it access to restricted information and abilities by using the enablePrivilege method. A deficiency in the way that these products create dialog boxes via enablePrivilege allows a malicious script to supply a string including spaces and normal text for the dialog box. A malicious signed script requesting enhanced abilities could construct the request in a way that possibly fooled the user into thinking the privilege requested was inconsequential while actually obtaining explicit permission to run and install software. The user would still be required to explicitly click "Ok" in the grant dialog for exploitation of this issue to be successful. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a victim to accept a signed script, a remote attacker may be able to install and run software with the privileges of the user running an affected program. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade to a fixed version of the affected software**  [The Mozilla Project](http://www.mozilla.org/) has released new versions of the affected software that include patches for this vulnerability. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more information. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  Users who are unable to upgrade to a patched version of the software are encouraged to apply the following workarounds:     + Disable Javascript + Never grant enhanced abilities of any kind to untrusted web pages (this workaround comes from from the Mozilla project advisory about this issue) |
