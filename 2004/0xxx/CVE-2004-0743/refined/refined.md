Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Apple Safari handles form data during HTTP redirects, specifically when using the back/forward buttons.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- When a web form is submitted using the POST method, and the server responds with an HTTP redirect to a GET method URL, Safari may incorrectly re-POST the form data to the GET URL. This is a violation of how HTTP methods should function, where GET should not have a request body.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive form data can be disclosed to a remote server. If the redirected URL is controlled by an attacker, they can capture the submitted form data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by submitting a web form via POST, the server redirecting via HTTP to a GET method URL and then using browser's forward/backward navigation buttons.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control a web server that can redirect form submissions to a URL that they control or observe. The attacker would need to entice the user to fill out a form that submits using POST.
