OpenPKG Security Advisory                            The OpenPKG Project
<http://www.openpkg.org/security.html>              <http://www.openpkg.org>
openpkg-security@openpkg.org                         openpkg@openpkg.org
OpenPKG-SA-2004.039                                          13-Sep-2004
________________________________________________________________________

Package:             kerberos
Vulnerability:       arbitrary code execution, denial of service
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:         Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= kerberos-1.3.4-20040730 >= kerberos-1.3.4-20040901
OpenPKG 2.1          <= kerberos-1.3.4-2.1.0    >= kerberos-1.3.4-2.1.1
OpenPKG 2.0          <= kerberos-1.3.1-2.0.1    >= kerberos-1.3.1-2.0.2

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to two vendor security advisories [1][[2]](#2), multiple
  vulnerabilities exists in the Kerberos [[0]](#0) network authentication
  system. The first set of problems are double-free issues in the KDC
  and libraries. The second problem is a denial-of-service vulnerability
  in the ASN.1 decoder. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
  project assigned the ids CAN-2004-0642 [[3]](#3), CAN-2004-0643 [[4]](#4),
  CAN-2004-0644 [[5]](#5) and CAN-2004-0772 [[6]](#6) to the problems.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/openpkg
  rpm -q kerberos". If you have the "kerberos" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution) [7][[8]](#8).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [9][[10]](#10), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [11][[12]](#12) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[13]](#13), build a corresponding binary
  RPM from it [[7]](#7) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [[8]](#8). For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.1, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.1/UPD
  ftp> get kerberos-1.3.4-2.1.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig kerberos-1.3.4-2.1.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild kerberos-1.3.4-2.1.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/kerberos-1.3.4-2.1.1.*.rpm

Package        : krb5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0642 CAN-2004-0643 CAN-2004-0644 CAN-2004-0772
CERT advisory  : VU#795632 VU#866472 VU#550464 VU#350792

The MIT Kerberos Development Team has discovered a number of
vulnerabilities in the MIT Kerberos Version 5 software.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:

CAN-2004-0642 [VU#795632]

    A double-free error may allow unauthenticated remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary code on KDC or clients.

CAN-2004-0643 [VU#866472]

    Several double-free errors may allow authenticated attackers to
    execute arbitrary code on Kerberos application servers.

CAN-2004-0644 [VU#550464]

    A remotely eploitable denial of service vulnerability has been
    found in the KDC and libraries.

CAN-2004-0772 [VU#350792]

    Several double-free errors may allow remote attackers to execute
    arbitrary code on the server.  This does not affect the version in
    woody.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.4-5woody6.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.4-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.

# MIT krb5: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200409-09**

MIT krb5 contains several double-free vulnerabilities, potentially allowing
the execution of arbitrary code, as well as a denial of service
vulnerability.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-crypt/mit-krb5** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.4** |

### Background

MIT krb5 is the free implementation of the Kerberos network authentication
protocol by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

### Description

The implementation of the Key Distribution Center (KDC) and the MIT krb5
library contain double-free vulnerabilities, making client programs as well
as application servers vulnerable.

The ASN.1 decoder library is vulnerable to a denial of service attack,
including the KDC.

### Impact

The double-free vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code on a KDC host and hosts running krb524d or vulnerable
services. In the case of a KDC host, this can lead to a compromise of the
entire Kerberos realm. Furthermore, an attacker impersonating a legitimate
KDC or application server can potentially execute arbitrary code on
authenticating clients.

An attacker can cause a denial of service for a KDC or application server
and clients, the latter if impersonating a legitimate KDC or application
server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All mit-krb5 users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.3.4"
 # emerge ">=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.3.4"
```

MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2004-003
Original release: 2004-08-31
Topic: ASN.1 decoder denial of service
Severity: serious
SUMMARY
=======
The ASN.1 decoder library in the MIT Kerberos 5 distribution is
vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack causing an infinite loop in
the decoder. The KDC is vulnerable to this attack.
IMPACT
======
\* An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a KDC or application
server to hang inside an infinite loop. [CAN-2004-0644]
\* An attacker impersonating a legitimate KDC or application server may
cause a client program to hang inside an infinite
loop. [CAN-2004-0644]
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
\* KDC software and applications from MIT Kerberos 5 releases
krb5-1.2.2 through krb5-1.3.4.
\* Applications using the MIT krb5 libraries from the above releases.
FIXES
=====
\* The upcoming krb5-1.3.5 release will contain fixes for these
problems.
\* Apply the appropriate patch referenced below, and rebuild the software.
Patches available:
\* Patch against krb5-1.3.4 (should apply to earlier krb5-1.3.x releases)
\* Patch against krb5-1.2.8 (should apply to releases krb5-1.2.2
through krb5-1.2.7 as well)
PATCH AGAINST krb5-1.3.4
========================
\* This patch was generated against krb5-1.3.4; it may
apply, with some offset, to earlier krb5-1.3.x releases.
This patch may also be found at:

CVE CAN-2004-0644
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0644
ASN.1 decoder bug in MIT Kerberos 5 releases krb5-1.2.2
through krb5-1.3.4 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to
induce infinite loop, causing denial of service, including in
KDC code
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============
Thanks to Will Fiveash and Nico Williams at Sun for finding this
vulnerability.
DETAILS
=======
The ASN.1 decoder in the MIT krb5 library handles indefinite-length
BER encodings for the purpose of backwards compatibility with some
non-conformant implementations. The ASN.1 decoders call
asn1buf\_sync() to skip any trailing unrecognized fields in the
encoding of a SEQUENCE type. asn1buf\_sync() calls asn1buf\_skiptail()
if the ASN.1 SEQUENCE type being decoded was encoded with an
indefinite length. asn1buf\_sync() is provided with a prefetched BER
tag; a placeholder tag is provided by the prefetching code in the case
where there is are no more octets in a sub-encoding.
The loop in asn1buf\_skiptail() which attempts to skip trailing
sub-encodings of an indefinite-length SEQUENCE type does not properly
check for end-of-subbuffer conditions or for the placeholder tag,
leading to an infinite loop. Valid BER encodings cannot cause this
condition; however, it is trivial to construct a corrupt encoding
which will trigger the infinite loop.

## MIT Kerberos 5 ASN.1 decoding function asn1buf\_skiptail() does not properly terminate loop

#### Vulnerability Note VU#550464

Original Release Date: 2004-09-02 | Last Revised: 2004-09-03

---

### Overview

The asn1buf\_skiptail() function in the MIT Kerberos 5 library does not properly terminate a loop, allowing an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service in a Kerberos Distribution Center (KDC), application server, or Kerberos client.

### Description

| As described on the [MIT Kerberos web site:](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/#what_is) "Kerberos is a network authentication protocol. It is designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography." MIT Kerberos code is used in network applications from a variety of different vendors and is included in many UNIX and Linux distributions.  Kerberos 5 protocol messages are defined using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1). The Basic Encoding Rules (BER) describe how to represent the values of ASN.1 types in byte strings. The MIT Kerberos 5 library function asn1buf\_skiptail() contains a loop that does not properly check either the end of a buffer or the position of a pointer into the buffer. A specially crafted BER encoding in an ASN.1 sequence can cause asn1buf\_skiptail() to enter an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service. [MITKRB5-SA-2004-003](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2004-003-asn1.txt) provides further detail:The ASN.1 decoder in the MIT krb5 library handles indefinite-lengthBER encodings for the purpose of backwards compatibility with somenon-conformant implementations. The ASN.1 decoders callasn1buf\_sync() to skip any trailing unrecognized fields in theencoding of a SEQUENCE type.  asn1buf\_sync() calls asn1buf\_skiptail()if the ASN.1 SEQUENCE type being decoded was encoded with anindefinite length.  asn1buf\_sync() is provided with a prefetched BERtag; a placeholder tag is provided by the prefetching code in the casewhere there is are no more octets in a sub-encoding.The loop in asn1buf\_skiptail() which attempts to skip trailingsub-encodings of an indefinite-length SEQUENCE type does not properlycheck for end-of-subbuffer conditions or for the placeholder tag,leading to an infinite loop.   Valid BER encodings cannot cause thiscondition; however, it is trivial to construct a corrupt encodingwhich will trigger the infinite loop. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated, remote attacker could cause a denial of service on a KDC or application server. An attacker who is able to impersonate a KDC or application server may be able to cause a denial of service on Kerberos clients. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**  Apply the appropriate patch(es) referenced in [MITKRB5-SA-2004-003](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2004-003-asn1.txt) or specified by your vendor.**Upgrade**According to [MITKRB5-SA-2004-003](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2004-003-asn1.txt), "The upcoming krb5-1.3.5 release will contain fixes for these problems." |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**Depending on network architecture, it may be practical to restrict access to KDC servers (88/udp) from untrusted networks such as the Internet. Due to network application requirements, it may be possible, but less practical, to limit access from Kerberos clients to trusted KDC and application servers. While these workarounds will help to limit the source of attacks, they will not prevent attacks from trusted hosts or networks or attackers who can successfully spoof their source addresses. |

RHSA-2004:350 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2004-08-31
Updated:
2004-08-31
# RHSA-2004:350 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

krb5 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Topic

Updated krb5 packages that improve client responsiveness and fix several
security issues are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

## Description

Kerberos is a networked authentication system that uses a trusted third
party (a KDC) to authenticate clients and servers to each other.

Several double-free bugs were found in the Kerberos 5 KDC and libraries. A
remote attacker could potentially exploit these flaws to execuate arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the names CAN-2004-0642 and CAN-2004-0643 to these issues.

A double-free bug was also found in the krb524 server (CAN-2004-0772),
however this issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 Kerberos
packages.

An infinite loop bug was found in the Kerberos 5 ASN.1 decoder library. A
remote attacker may be able to trigger this flaw and cause a denial of
service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CAN-2004-0644 to this issue.

When attempting to contact a KDC, the Kerberos libraries will iterate
through the list of configured servers, attempting to contact each in turn.
If one of the servers becomes unresponsive, the client will time out and
contact the next configured server. When the library attempts to contact
the next KDC, the entire process is repeated. For applications which must
contact a KDC several times, the accumulated time spent waiting can become
significant.

This update modifies the libraries, notes which server for a given realm
last responded to a request, and attempts to contact that server first
before contacting any of the other configured servers.

All users of krb5 should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported security patches to resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade. Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated. Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated. Note that you
can also use wildcards (\*.rpm) if your current directory \*only\* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network. Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate. The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt>

Refer to the [Life Cycle Security Update Policy](https://access.redhat.com/security/lifecycle-security-update-policy) for information on Red Hat's security update policy as well as information on embargoed (undisclosed) vulnerability handling.

### Resources include the following:

[Red Hat Security Updates (Advisories)](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/security-advisories)

[Red Hat CVE Database](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/cve)

[Red Hat Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) Program](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cve_program)

## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)

Red Hat engages with partners, vendors, researchers, and community coordinators to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and services. Multi-party coordination is a complex process, and understanding the parties' vulnerability disclosure policies, vulnerability handling policies, and contractual agreements opens the way to trusted communication and collaboration. Increasing transparency between parties assures that vendors can understand and manage the risk imposed by the vulnerability and facilitate engagements with other parties. The aim of CVD is to provide timely and consistent guidance to parties and customers to help them protect themselves.

Please see the [Red Hat CNA Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cna_vulnerability_disclosure_policy) for details on how Red Hat discloses security vulnerabilities under the Red Hat/Fedora scope.
