Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2004-0644:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the ASN.1 decoder in the MIT Kerberos 5 library. Specifically, the `asn1buf_skiptail()` function, which is used to skip trailing unrecognized fields in a BER encoded SEQUENCE, does not properly check for end-of-subbuffer conditions or placeholder tags. This can lead to an infinite loop if a crafted, malformed ASN.1 sequence with indefinite length is processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite Loop:** The core vulnerability is the potential for an infinite loop in the `asn1buf_skiptail()` function, which is triggered by malformed indefinite-length BER encodings.
*   **Lack of Proper Bounds Checking:** The loop doesn't properly validate the buffer boundaries, or check if it has reached the end of the sub-encoding. It also fails to recognize a placeholder tag indicating end of sub-encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most significant impact is a denial of service. A crafted message can cause the affected service (KDC, application server, or even client, if impersonated) to hang indefinitely in the infinite loop, making the service unavailable.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Continuous looping consumes CPU resources, potentially affecting overall server performance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack:** An attacker can send specially crafted malformed ASN.1 BER encoded messages to a vulnerable Kerberos service over the network. This is possible because of the handling of indefinite-length encodings in the Kerberos protocol.
*   **Impersonation:** An attacker could also impersonate a legitimate KDC or application server and send the crafted malicious message to a Kerberos client, resulting in DoS for the client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send network packets to the target server or client.
*   **Malicious Message Generation:** The attacker must be able to construct a malformed ASN.1 BER encoding that triggers the infinite loop in the ASN.1 decoder.

**Additional details from the provided documents:**

*   **Affected Software:** MIT Kerberos 5 releases krb5-1.2.2 through krb5-1.3.4 are vulnerable.
*   **Affected Components:**  The vulnerability affects the KDC software, applications using the MIT krb5 libraries, as well as Kerberos clients which process messages from compromised or malicious servers.
*   **Fix:** The fix involves applying a patch to the `asn1buf.c` file which adds a check to prevent the infinite loop.

The vulnerability is classified as a remotely exploitable denial of service.
