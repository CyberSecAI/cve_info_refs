MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2004-002
Original release: 2004-08-31
Topic: double-free vulnerabilities in KDC and libraries
Severity: CRITICAL
SUMMARY
=======
The MIT Kerberos 5 implementation's Key Distribution Center (KDC)
program contains a double-free vulnerability that potentially allows a
remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. Compromise of a KDC host
compromises the security of the entire authentication realm served by
the KDC. Additionally, double-free vulnerabilities exist in MIT
Kerberos 5 library code, making client programs and application
servers vulnerable.
Exploitation of double-free bugs is believed to be difficult. No
exploits are known to exist for these vulnerabilities.
IMPACT
======
\* A unauthenticated remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary
code on a KDC host, compromising an entire Kerberos
realm. [CAN-2004-0642]
\* A remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on a host
running krb524d, possibly compromising an entire Kerberos realm if
the host is a KDC host. [CAN-2004-0772]
\* An authenticated attacker can also potentially execute arbitrary
code on hosts running vulnerable services. [CAN-2004-0643]
\* An attacker impersonating a legitimate KDC or application server can
potentially execute arbitrary code on a client host while the client
is authenticating. [CAN-2004-0642]
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
\* KDC software from all releases of MIT Kerberos 5 up to and including
krb5-1.3.4. [CAN-2004-0642]
\* The krb524d program from krb5-1.2.8 and later. The krb524d present
in earlier releases is vulnerable if it has been patched to disable
krb4 cross-realm functionality. [CAN-2004-0772]
\* Applications calling the krb5\_rd\_cred() function in releases prior
to krb5-1.3.2. Such applications in the MIT krb5 releases include
the remote login daemons (krshd, klogind, and telnetd) and the FTP
daemon. The krb5\_rd\_cred() function decrypts and decodes forwarded
Kerberos credentials. Third-party applications calling this
function directly or indirectly (by means of the GSSAPI or other
libraries) are vulnerable. [CAN-2004-0643]
\* Client code from all releases of MIT Kerberos 5 up to and including
krb5-1.3.4. Third-party applications directly or indirectly calling
client library functions may also be vulnerable. [CAN-2004-0642]
FIXES
=====
\* The upcoming krb5-1.3.5 release will contain fixes for these
problems.
\* Apply the appropriate patch or patches referenced below, and rebuild
the software.
- If you are running krb5-1.3 through krb5-1.3.4, apply
2004-002-patch\_1.3.4.txt.
- If you are running krb5-1.3 through krb5-1.3.1, apply
2004-002-patch\_1.3.1.txt.
- If you are running krb5-1.2.8, apply
2004-002-patch\_1.2.8.txt.
- Things become more complicated if you are running krb5-1.2 through
krb5-1.2.7. The correct set of patches to apply will depend on
whether you have applied the patches to disable krb4 cross-realm
functionality [MITKRB5-SA-2003-004].
+ If you are running krb5-1.2.6 through krb5-1.2.7, and have
applied the patches to disable krb4 cross-realm functionality,
apply 2004-002-patch\_1.2.8.txt.
+ If you are running krb5-1.2 through krb5-1.2.5, and have applied
the patches to disable krb4 cross-realm functionality, apply
2004-002-patch\_1.2.7.txt, followed by
2004-002-k524d\_patch\_1.2.5.txt.
+ If you are running krb5-1.2 through krb5-1.2.7, and have not
applied the patches to disable krb4 cross-realm functionality,
apply 2004-002-patch\_1.2.7.txt.

these vulnerabilities and for providing initial patches.
Thanks to Marc Horowitz for discovering the krb524d vulnerability.
Thanks to Nalin Dahyabhai for providing a corrected patch for krb524d

Thanks to Joseph Galbraith and John Hawkinson, who both independently
discovered the double-free in krb5\_rd\_cred() which was corrected in
release krb5-1.3.2.
DETAILS
=======
In the MIT krb5 library, in all releases up to and including
krb5-1.3.4, ASN.1 decoder functions and their callers do not use a
consistent set of memory management conventions. The callers expect
the decoders to allocate memory. The callers typically have
error-handling code which frees memory allocated by the ASN.1 decoders
if pointers to the allocated memory are non-null. Upon encountering
error conditions, the ASN.1 decoders themselves free memory which they
have allocated, but do not null the corresponding pointers. When some
library functions receive errors from the ASN.1 decoders, they attempt
to pass the non-null pointer (which points to freed memory) to free(),
causing a double-free.
In all releases of MIT krb5 up to and including krb5-1.3.4, cleanup
code in the KDC frees memory returned by ASN.1 decoders. This cleanup
code only frees memory pointed to by non-null pointers, but if an
ASN.1 decoder returns an error, the cleanup code will free memory
previously freed by the decoder.
Implementations of krb5\_rd\_cred() prior to the krb5-1.3.2 release
contained code to explicitly free the buffer returned by the ASN.1
decoder function decode\_krb5\_enc\_cred\_part() when the decoder returns
an error. This is another double-free, since the decoder would itself
free the buffer on error. Since decode\_krb5\_enc\_cred\_part() does not
get called unless the decryption of the encrypted part of the KRB-CRED
is successful, the attacker needs to have authenticated. This code
was corrected in the krb5-1.3.2 release.
The patch (introduced in krb5-1.2.8 and present in all subsequent
releases) for disabling krb4 cross-realm authentication in krb524d
introduced a double-free vulnerability. If handle\_classic\_v4() denies
the conversion of a cross-realm ticket, v5tkt->enc\_part2 gets freed
but not nulled, so do\_connection() double-frees many things when it
subsequently calls krb5\_free\_ticket().

# MIT krb5: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200409-09**

MIT krb5 contains several double-free vulnerabilities, potentially allowing
the execution of arbitrary code, as well as a denial of service
vulnerability.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-crypt/mit-krb5** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.4** |

### Background

MIT krb5 is the free implementation of the Kerberos network authentication
protocol by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

### Description

The implementation of the Key Distribution Center (KDC) and the MIT krb5
library contain double-free vulnerabilities, making client programs as well
as application servers vulnerable.

The ASN.1 decoder library is vulnerable to a denial of service attack,
including the KDC.

### Impact

The double-free vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code on a KDC host and hosts running krb524d or vulnerable
services. In the case of a KDC host, this can lead to a compromise of the
entire Kerberos realm. Furthermore, an attacker impersonating a legitimate
KDC or application server can potentially execute arbitrary code on
authenticating clients.

An attacker can cause a denial of service for a KDC or application server
and clients, the latter if impersonating a legitimate KDC or application
server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All mit-krb5 users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.3.4"
 # emerge ">=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.3.4"
```

## MIT Kerberos krb524d insecurely deallocates memory (double-free)

#### Vulnerability Note VU#350792

Original Release Date: 2004-09-02 | Last Revised: 2004-09-03

---

### Overview

The MIT Kerberos krb524d daemon does not securely deallocate heap memory when handling an error condition, resulting in a double-free vulnerability. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on a system running krb524d, which in many cases is also a Kerberos Distribution Center (KDC). The compromise of a KDC system can lead to the compromise of an entire Kerberos realm. An attacker may also be able to cause a denial of service on a system running krb524d.

### Description

| As described on the [MIT Kerberos web site:](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/#what_is) "Kerberos is a network authentication protocol. It is designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography." MIT Kerberos code is used in network applications from a variety of different vendors and is included in many UNIX and Linux distributions.  The MIT Kerberos krb524d daemon converts Kerberos 5 service tickets into Kerberos 4 service tickets. There is a double-free vulnerability in krb524d that can be triggered during the conversion of a cross-realm ticket. From [MITKRB5-SA-2004-002](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2004-002-dblfree.txt):The patch (introduced in krb5-1.2.8 and present in all subsequentreleases) for disabling krb4 cross-realm authentication in krb524dintroduced a double-free vulnerability.  If handle\_classic\_v4() deniesthe conversion of a cross-realm ticket, v5tkt->enc\_part2 gets freedbut not nulled, so do\_connection() double-frees many things when itsubsequently calls krb5\_free\_ticket(). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated, remote attacker to could execute arbitrary code on a system running krb524d. In many cases, this system also operates a KDC, so this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain the master secret for a Kerberos realm, leading to compromise of the entire realm. An attacker may also be able to crash a system running krb524d, causing a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**  Apply the appropriate patch(es) referenced in [MITKRB5-SA-2004-002](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2004-002-dblfree.txt) or specified by your vendor.**Upgrade**According to [MITKRB5-SA-2004-002](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2004-002-dblfree.txt), "The upcoming krb5-1.3.5 release will contain fixes for these problems." |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**Depending on network architecture, it may be practical to restrict access to systems running krb524d (4444/udp) from untrusted networks such as the Internet. While this will help to limit the source of attacks, it will not prevent attacks from trusted hosts or networks or attackers who can successfully spoof their source addresses. |

CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0642 CAN-2004-0643 CAN-2004-0644 CAN-2004-0772
CERT advisory  : VU#795632 VU#866472 VU#550464 VU#350792

The MIT Kerberos Development Team has discovered a number of
vulnerabilities in the MIT Kerberos Version 5 software.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:

CAN-2004-0642 [VU#795632]

    A double-free error may allow unauthenticated remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary code on KDC or clients.

CAN-2004-0643 [VU#866472]

    Several double-free errors may allow authenticated attackers to
    execute arbitrary code on Kerberos application servers.

CAN-2004-0644 [VU#550464]

    A remotely eploitable denial of service vulnerability has been
    found in the KDC and libraries.

CAN-2004-0772 [VU#350792]

    Several double-free errors may allow remote attackers to execute
    arbitrary code on the server.  This does not affect the version in
    woody.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.4-5woody6.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.4-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.
