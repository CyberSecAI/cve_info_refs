Deprotect Security Advisory 20041405
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Advisory ID  : DEPROTECT-20041405
Authors      : Christer Oberg, Joel Soderberg
Publish date : 17/05/2004
Application  : Procfs
Version(s)   : 3.5 (and earlier versions)
Platforms    : OpenBSD
CVE#         :
Availability : <http://www.deprotect.com/advisories/DEPROTECT-20041305.txt>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Kernel memory disclosure via procfs.

Description:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Several integer related bugs in the procfs code can lead to kernel
memory disclosure. For example it is possible to trick procfs to return
large chunks of kernel memory when reading the cmdline file of system
processes.

This code is found in procfs_cmdline.c:

	if (P_ZOMBIE(p) || (p->p_flag & P_SYSTEM) != 0) {
               len = snprintf(arg, PAGE_SIZE, "(%s)", p->p_comm);
               xlen = len - uio->uio_offset;
               if (xlen <= 0)
                       error = 0;
               else
                       error = uiomove(arg, xlen, uio);
		free(arg, M_TEMP);
               return (error);
	}

It is trivial to for example pread() the descriptor with an offset and
have it return more data than it should. There are other examples of
similar bugs in the procfs code.

Workaround:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Unmount procfs.

* **001: BROKEN PACKAGE ON CD: May 4, 2004**  *macppc only*

  The powerpc autobook-1.3.tgz package found on CD2 has been found to be corrupt,
  and will not extract.
  A replacement package can be found on the ftp sites.

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: May 5, 2004**
      *All architectures*

    Pathname validation problems have been found in
    [cvs(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.5/cvs.1),
    allowing malicious clients to create files outside the repository, allowing
    malicious servers to overwrite files outside the local CVS tree on
    the client and allowing clients to check out files outside the CVS
    repository.

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: May 20, 2004**
                *All architectures*

              A heap overflow in the
              [cvs(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.5/cvs.1)
              server has been discovered that can be exploited by clients sending
              malformed requests, enabling these clients to run arbitrary code
              with the same privileges as the CVS server program.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.5/common/007_cvs2.patch)

              * **008: SECURITY FIX: May 26, 2004**
                  *All architectures*

                With the introduction of IPv6 code in
                [xdm(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.5/xdm.1),
                one test on the 'requestPort' resource was deleted by accident. This
                makes xdm create the chooser socket even if xdmcp is disabled in
                xdm-config, by setting requestPort to 0. See
                [XFree86
                bugzilla](http://bugs.xfree86.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1376) for details.

                * **009: SECURITY FIX: May 30, 2004**
                    *All architectures*

                  A flaw in the Kerberos V
                  [kdc(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.5/kdc)
                  server could result in the administrator of a Kerberos realm having
                  the ability to impersonate any principal in any other realm which
                  has established a cross-realm trust with their realm. The flaw is due to
                  inadequate checking of the "transited" field in a Kerberos request. For
                  more details see [Heimdal's announcement](http://www.pdc.kth.se/heimdal/advisory/2004-04-01/).

                      *All architectures*

                    A FIFO bug was introduced in OpenBSD 3.5 that occurs when a FIFO is opened in
                    non-blocking mode for writing when there are no processes reading the FIFO.
                    One program affected by this is the [qmail](https://cr.yp.to/qmail.html)
                    mail server which could go into an infinite loop and consume all CPU.

                        *All architectures*

                      Multiple remote vulnerabilities have been found in the

                                        Eilko Bos reported that radius authentication, as implemented by
                                        [login\_radius(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.5/login_radius.8),
                                        was not checking the shared secret used for replies sent by the radius server.
                                        This could allow an attacker to spoof a reply granting access to the
                                        attacker. Note that OpenBSD does not ship with radius authentication enabled.

                                          BIND contains a bug which results in BIND trying to contact nameservers via IPv6, even in
                                          cases where IPv6 connectivity is non-existent. This results in unnecessary timeouts and
                                          thus slow DNS queries.

Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.4.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

* **001: DOCUMENTATION FIX: November 1, 2003**
    *All architectures*

  The CD insert documentation has an incorrect example for package installation.

  Where it is written:

  **# pkg\_add https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/3.4/packages/i386**

  It should instead read:

  **# pkg\_add https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/3.4/packages/i386/**

  The extra **/** at the end is important. We do not make
  patch files available for things printed on paper.

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: November 1, 2003**
      *All architectures*

    The use of certain ASN.1 encodings or malformed public keys may allow an
    attacker to mount a denial of service attack against applications linked with
    [ssl(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/ssl.3).
    This does not affect OpenSSH.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.4/common/002_asn1.patch)

    * **003: RELIABILITY FIX: November 1, 2003**
        *All architectures*

      It is possible for a local user to cause a system panic by flooding it with spoofed ARP
      requests.

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: November 1, 2003**
          *All architectures*

        A user with write permission to `httpd.conf` or a `.htaccess`
        file can crash
        [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/httpd.8)
        or potentially run arbitrary code as the user `www` (although it
        is believed that ProPolice will prevent code execution).

        * **005: RELIABILITY FIX: November 4, 2003**
            *All architectures*

          It is possible for a local user to cause a system panic by executing a specially crafted binary with an invalid header.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.4/common/005_exec.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: November 17, 2003**
              *i386 only*

            It may be possible for a local user to overrun the stack in
            [compat\_ibcs2(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/compat_ibcs2.8).

            ProPolice catches this, turning a potential privilege escalation into a denial
            of service. iBCS2 emulation does not need to be enabled via
            [sysctl(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/sysctl.8)
            for this to happen.

            * **007: RELIABILITY FIX: November 20, 2003**
                *All architectures*

              It is possible for a local user to cause a crash via
              [sysctl(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/sysctl.3) with certain arguments.

              * **008: RELIABILITY FIX: November 20, 2003**
                  *All architectures*

                An improper bounds check makes it possible for a local user to cause a crash
                by passing the
                [semctl(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/semctl.2) and
                [semop(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/semop.2) functions
                certain arguments.

                * **009: SECURITY FIX: January 13, 2004**
                    *All architectures*

                  Several message handling flaws in
                  [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/isakmpd.8)
                  have been reported by Thomas Walpuski. These allow an attacker to delete arbitrary SAs. The patch also
                  includes a reliability fix for a filedescriptor leak that causes problems when a crypto card is
                  installed.

                      *All architectures*

                    A reference counting bug exists in the
                    [shmat(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/shmat.2)

                        *All architectures*

                      An IPv6 MTU handling problem exists that could be used by an attacker
                      to cause a denial of service attack against hosts with reachable IPv6
                      TCP ports.

                          *All architectures*

                        Several buffer overflows exist in the code parsing
                        font.aliases files in XFree86. Thanks to ProPolice, these cannot be
                        exploited to gain privileges, but they can cause the X server to abort.

                        * **013: RELIABILITY FIX: March 8, 2004**
                            *All architectures*

                          OpenBSD's TCP/IP stack did not impose limits on how many out-of-order
                          TCP segments are queued in the system. An attacker could
                          send out-of-order TCP segments and trick the system into using all
                          available memory buffers.

                              *All architectures*

                            Due to a bug in the parsing of Allow/Deny rules for
                            [httpd(8)'s](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/httpd.8)

                            platforms causes the rules to fail to match. This only affects sparc64.

                              Defects in the payload validation and processing functions of
                              [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.4/isakmpd.8)
                              have been discovered. An attacker could send malformed ISAKMP messages and
                              cause isakmpd to crash or to loop endlessly. This patch fixes these problems
                              and removes some memory leaks.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Date:       [2004-05-13 8:08:48](?l=openbsd-security-announce&r=1&w=2&b=200405)

Incorrect bounds checking in several procfs functions could allow an
unprivileged malicious user to read arbitrary kernel memory, with the
potential to use this information to escalate privilege.  OpenBSD does not
mount the proc filesystem by default, and we continue to recommend against
its use.

The cvs -stable branches have been updated to contain a fix, which is also
available in patch form for 3.4 and 3.5.

Credit goes to Deprotect Advisories <advisories@deprotect.com> for
identification of the bug.
