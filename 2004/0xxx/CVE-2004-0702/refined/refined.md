The provided content is a security advisory for Bugzilla, detailing multiple vulnerabilities. While it doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2004-0702, it describes several issues that could potentially be assigned different CVE IDs. Here's a breakdown of the relevant vulnerabilities:

**Issue 1**
*   **Root Cause:**  Insufficient error handling when the SQL server is halted, leading to the database password being displayed in an error message to remote users.
*   **Weakness:**  Exposure of sensitive information (database password).
*   **Impact:**  Potential unauthorized database access if the exposed password is used.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Causing the SQL server to halt while the webserver is running.
*   **Required Capabilities:** No specific attacker capabilities are mentioned beyond being a remote user.
*   **Affected Versions:** Bugzilla versions 2.17.1 through 2.17.7 (2.16-based releases are not affected).

**Issue 2**
*   **Root Cause:**  Logic flaw in administrative controls for group membership management.
*   **Weakness:** Privilege escalation.
*   **Impact:**  A user can gain membership in groups they should not have access to, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.
*  **Attack Vector:** Tricking administrative controls for group membership management.
*   **Required Capabilities:** User with privileges to grant membership to one or more individual groups (e.g. administrator)
*   **Affected Versions:** Bugzilla versions 2.17.1 through 2.17.7 (2.16-based releases are not affected).

**Issue 3**
*   **Root Cause:**  Information disclosure due to the handling of hidden products in duplicates.cgi and buglist.cgi.
*   **Weakness:** Information Leak.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of product names that are supposed to be hidden from specific users.
*   **Attack Vector:** Accessing duplicates.cgi or the mass-edit form in buglist.cgi
*   **Required Capabilities:** A regular user who should not have access to the hidden products.
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions prior to 2.16.6 and 2.18rc1.

**Issue 4**
*   **Root Cause:**  Lack of proper escaping of user-provided data in several administration CGIs.
*   **Weakness:** Cross-site scripting vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Allows injection of malicious scripts which can potentially lead to account compromise and other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:** Submitting malicious data through administration CGIs that is not properly escaped when echoed back to the user.
*  **Required Capabilities:**  Remote user access.
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions prior to 2.16.6 and 2.18rc1.

**Issue 5**
*   **Root Cause:** Embedding of user password within an image URL if a login prompt occurs while viewing a chart.
*   **Weakness:** Exposing sensitive user password within web server logs
*   **Impact:** Password exposure if logs are viewed by unauthorized individuals.
*   **Attack Vector:** Viewing a chart that requires a login, leading to the password being embedded in an image URL.
*   **Required Capabilities:** No specific attacker capabilities are mentioned beyond being a remote user that tries to view a chart.
*  **Affected Versions:** Bugzilla versions 2.17.5 through 2.17.7 (2.16-based releases are not affected).

**Issue 6**
*   **Root Cause:** Vulnerability in `editusers.cgi` that allows execution of arbitrary SQL commands
*  **Weakness:** Remote SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the SQL database which may result in a complete compromise of the system and its data.
*   **Attack Vector:** Tricking editusers.cgi into executing arbitrary SQL
*   **Required Capabilities:** A user with privileges to grant membership to any group (e.g. administrator)
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions prior to 2.16.6 and 2.18rc1

The advisory recommends upgrading to Bugzilla 2.16.6 or 2.18rc1 to address these vulnerabilities.
