Package        : imagemagic
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0827
Debian Bug     : 268357

Marcus Meissner from SUSE has discovered several buffer overflows in
the ImageMagick graphics library.  An attacker could create a
malicious image or video file in AVI, BMP, or DIB format that could
crash the reading process.  It might be possible that carefully
crafted images could also allow to execute arbitrary code with the
capabilities of the invoking process.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.4.5-1woody3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.0.6.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
