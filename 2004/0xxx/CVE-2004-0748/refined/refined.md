{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A potential infinite loop in the input filter of mod_ssl.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Infinite loop vulnerability in mod_ssl input filter"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by forcing an SSL connection to abort in a specific way, leading to excessive CPU resource consumption.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a remote attacker forces an SSL connection to be aborted in a particular state.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to establish and then abort an SSL connection to the targeted server. No special privileges or access to the server is mentioned, thus the attack can be carried out remotely."
