# Apache 2, mod\_dav: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200409-21**

Several vulnerabilities have been found in Apache 2 and mod\_dav for Apache
1.3 which could allow a remote attacker to cause a Denial of Service or a
local user to get escalated privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.51** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.51**< **2.0** |

| Package | **net-www/mod\_dav** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.0.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.3-r2** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP server is one of most popular web servers on the internet.
mod\_ssl provides SSL v2/v3 and TLS v1 support for it and mod\_dav is the
Apache module for Distributed Authoring and Versioning (DAV).

### Description

A potential infinite loop has been found in the input filter of mod\_ssl
(CAN-2004-0748) as well as a possible segmentation fault in the
char\_buffer\_read function if reverse proxying to a SSL server is being used
(CAN-2004-0751). Furthermore, mod\_dav, as shipped in Apache httpd 2 or
mod\_dav 1.0.x for Apache 1.3, contains a NULL pointer dereference which can
be triggered remotely (CAN-2004-0809). The third issue is an input
validation error found in the IPv6 URI parsing routines within the apr-util
library (CAN-2004-0786). Additionally a possible buffer overflow has been
reported when expanding environment variables during the parsing of
configuration files (CAN-2004-0747).

### Impact

A remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service either by aborting a SSL
connection in a special way, resulting in CPU consumption, by exploiting
the segmentation fault in mod\_ssl or the mod\_dav flaw. A remote attacker
could also crash a httpd child process by sending a specially crafted URI.
The last vulnerabilty could be used by a local user to gain the privileges
of a httpd child, if the server parses a carefully prepared .htaccess file.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache 2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.51"
 # emerge ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.51"
```

All mod\_dav users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-www/mod_dav-1.0.3-r2"
 # emerge ">=net-www/mod_dav-1.0.3-r2"
```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=130750#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2004-08-24 09:43:57 UTC  ``` Apache bug 29964 is "A remote attacker who forces an SSL connection to be aborted in a particular state may cause an Apache child process to enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU resources."  Fixed upstream Aug11.  This doesn't affect mod_ssl with Apache 1.3          [CAN-2004-0748](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-0748) Affects: FC1         [CAN-2004-0748](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-0748) Affects: FC2   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=130750#c1)  Robert Scheck    2004-09-02 17:13:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 103399](attachment.cgi?id=103399&action=diff "httpd-2.0.50-ssl_engine_io.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=103399&action=edit "httpd-2.0.50-ssl_engine_io.patch") httpd-2.0.50-ssl_engine_io.patch  This patch should fix [CAN-2004-0748](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-0748), I currently can't find this patch it in httpd-2.0.50-5...   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=130750#c2)  Joe Orton    2004-09-03 08:20:33 UTC  ``` There will be a 2.0.51 release soon so the current plan is to wait for that and update to it, since neither of the mod_ssl issues look to be exploitable.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=130750#c3)  Joe Orton    2004-09-15 15:35:56 UTC  ``` 2.0.51 is now released which fixes:   * core: [CAN-2004-0747](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-0747)  * mod_dav_fs: [CAN-2004-0809](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-0809)  * mod_ssl: [CAN-2004-0751](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-0751), [CAN-2004-0748](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-0748)  along with an apr-util update which fixes [CAN-2004-0786](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-0786).  Updates are being prepared.    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=130750#c4)  Joe Orton    2004-09-17 16:30:22 UTC  ``` Packages are now available for FC2 from the testing repos:  <http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-test-list/2004-September/msg00610.html>  please post any feedback from testing these to this bug report.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=130750#c5)  Joe Orton    2004-09-23 18:21:22 UTC  ``` 2.0.51-2.7 updates issued, which include the fix for the [CAN-2004-0811](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-0811) regression in upstream 2.0.51.   ``` |  |

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
