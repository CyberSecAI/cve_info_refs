The provided content describes a denial-of-service vulnerability affecting Internet Explorer, Outlook, and Windows Explorer, triggered by a double null character in URLs.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A flawed assumption in the code responsible for parsing URLs, specifically in parsing the host name, leads to a dead loop consuming 100% CPU. The double null character suffix is not properly handled during hostname parsing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of double null characters (%00%00) within a URL's hostname, causing a parsing loop.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) for Internet Explorer, Outlook, and potentially Windows Explorer.
- Affected programs become unresponsive, consuming 100% CPU.
- Users must manually terminate the affected processes (iexplore.exe, outlook.exe) via the task manager to restore normal functionality.
- In some cases, Windows Explorer can also freeze, likely due to using the same vulnerable code.

**Attack vectors:**
- Forcing a user's browser (Internet Explorer) to open a malicious URL containing the double null characters. This can be achieved by:
  - Setting up a malicious website and tricking a user into visiting it.
  - Sending a malicious HTML email to a user using Outlook.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the user accesses the malicious URL, or in the case of Outlook, when the malicious email is rendered.
- The issue is sensitive to the "Do not save encrypted pages to disk" option in Internet Explorer being turned off, which is default.
- The computer under attack must be directly connected to the internet, not via an http proxy.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control a website or send an email to a target user.
- The attacker does not need any privileged access or credentials on the victim's machine.

**Additional details:**
- The issue is not consistent across all hostnames.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-004.
- A workaround exists by enabling the "Do not save encrypted pages to disk" option in Internet Explorer's advanced settings.
