The provided content describes a vulnerability related to the parsing of MIME messages, specifically involving RFC2047 encoding, and its impact on security products like content security gateways and antivirus software.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the inconsistent implementation of the RFC2047 standard for encoding non-ASCII text in MIME headers across different vendors. Some security products fail to properly interpret or handle malformed or uncommon RFC2047 encodings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inconsistent interpretation of RFC2047 encoding by security products.
- Failure of security products to detect threats hidden within malformed MIME messages using RFC2047 encoding.
- Liberal interpretation of MIME standards by some applications, which allows for bypassing security measures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Evasion of security products: Attackers can bypass security products like antivirus software, content security gateways, and email filters.
- Delivery of malicious content: Attackers can deliver malicious file attachments (e.g., executables, viruses) by using malformed MIME encapsulation, which bypasses content-based blocking mechanisms.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted MIME messages: The attacker crafts MIME messages with malformed RFC2047 encoding within header fields. This could be done via email (SMTP), HTTP, or other protocols that use MIME.
- Exploiting differences in handling: Attackers target systems where the client agent (e.g., browser, email client) correctly interprets the RFC2047 encoding, while security products fail to do so.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create and send MIME messages: The attacker needs the ability to craft messages with custom MIME headers, particularly the RFC2047 encoded sections.
- Knowledge of vulnerable targets: The attacker needs to identify targets that use vulnerable security products and client agents with differing interpretations of RFC2047 encoding.
