How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Webmin, Usermin: Multiple vulnerabilities in Usermin — GLSA **200409-15**

A vulnerability in the webmail function of Usermin could be used by an
attacker to execute shell code via a specially-crafted e-mail. A bug in the
installation script of Webmin and Usermin also allows a local user to
execute a symlink attack at installation time.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/usermin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.090** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.090** |

| Package | **app-admin/webmin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.160** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.160** |

### Background

Webmin and Usermin are web-based system administration consoles. Webmin
allows an administrator to easily configure servers and other features.
Usermin allows users to configure their own accounts, execute commands,
and read e-mail. The Usermin functionality, including webmail, is also
included in Webmin.

### Description

There is an input validation bug in the webmail feature of Usermin.

Additionally, the Webmin and Usermin installation scripts write to
/tmp/.webmin without properly checking if it exists first.

### Impact

The first vulnerability allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary
shell code in a specially-crafted e-mail. This could lead to remote
code execution with the privileges of the user running Webmin or
Usermin.

The second could allow local users who know Webmin or Usermin is going
to be installed to have arbitrary files be overwritten by creating a
symlink by the name /tmp/.webmin that points to some target file, e.g.
/etc/passwd.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Usermin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=app-admin/usermin-1.090"
 # emerge ">=app-admin/usermin-1.090"
```

All Webmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=app-admin/webmin-1.160"
 # emerge ">=app-admin/webmin-1.160"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
