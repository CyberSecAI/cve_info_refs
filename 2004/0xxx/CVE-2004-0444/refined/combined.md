## Multiple Symantec firewall products contain a heap corruption vulnerability in the handling of NBNS response packets

#### Vulnerability Note VU#294998

Original Release Date: 2004-05-13 | Last Revised: 2004-05-13

---

### Overview

There is a heap corruption vulnerability in multiple Symantec firewall products in which attempts to process a specially crafted NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS) response packet could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.

### Description

| Symantec offers a suite of corporate and consumer security products including a firewall application. The firewall application includes a SYMDNS.SYS driver, which is responsible for validating NBNS and DNS responses. There is a vulnerability in the routine responsible for processing incoming NBNS responses which could result in heap memory corruption. This routine fails to perform adequate bounds checking on the NBNS response packets. By supplying a specially crafted NBNS packet, an attacker could potentially overwrite arbitrary locations in memory.  According to the [Symantec Advisory](http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/security/Content/2004.05.12.html), the following products are affected:***Consumer:****Symantec Norton Internet Security and Professional 2002, 2003, 2004**Symantec Norton Personal Firewall 2002, 2003, 2004**Symantec Norton AntiSpam 2004****Corporate:****Symantec Client Firewall 5.01, 5.1.1**Symantec Client Security 1.0, 1.1, 2.0(SCF 7.1)* |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated, remote attacker could cause a denial of service condition or potentially execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges on a vulnerable system. According to the [eEye Digital Security Advisory](http://www.eeye.com/html/Research/Advisories/AD20040512C.html), in order for this vulnerability to be exploited, the firewall must be configured to allow NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS) traffic. This configuration is not present by default. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**  Symantec recommends that clients running corporate versions of the affected products apply patches obtained through their appropriate support channels.**Use LiveUpdate**Symantec recommends that clients running consumer versions of the affected products use the LiveUpdate feature to ensure all updates are installed. According to [Symantec](http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/security/Content/2004.05.12.html), this can be done as follows:     + Open any installed Symantec product + Click on LiveUpdate in the toolbar + Run LiveUpdate until Symantec LiveUpdate indicated that all installed Symantec products are up-to-date + Depending on the application, system may require a reboot to effectively update available fixes |

## Multiple Symantec firewall products fail to properly process NBNS response packets

#### Vulnerability Note VU#634414

Original Release Date: 2004-05-13 | Last Revised: 2004-06-02

---

### Overview

There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in multiple Symantec firewall products in which attempts to process a specially crafted NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS) response packet could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.

### Description

| Symantec offers a suite of corporate and consumer security products including a firewall application. The firewall application includes a SYMDNS.SYS driver, which is responsible for validating DNS and NBNS responses. There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the routines responsible for processing incoming NBNS responses. By supplying a specially crafted NBNS packet, an attacker could cause a stack overflow allowing arbitrary locations in memory to be overwritten.  According to the [Symantec Advisory](http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/security/Content/2004.05.12.html), the following products are affected:***Consumer:****Symantec Norton Internet Security and Professional 2002, 2003, 2004**Symantec Norton Personal Firewall 2002, 2003, 2004**Symantec Norton AntiSpam 2004****Corporate:****Symantec Client Firewall 5.01, 5.1.1**Symantec Client Security 1.0, 1.1, 2.0(SCF 7.1)* |

According to the [eEye Digital Security Advisory](http://www.eeye.com/html/Research/Advisories/AD20040512A.html), in order for this vulnerability to be exploited, the firewall must be configured to allow incoming 137/udp packets. This configuration is not present by default. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Multiple Symantec firewall products contain a buffer overflow in the processing of DNS resource records

#### Vulnerability Note VU#637318

Original Release Date: 2004-05-13 | Last Revised: 2004-05-13

---

### Overview

There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in multiple Symantec firewall products in which attempts to process a specially crafted Domain Name Service (DNS) packet could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.

### Description

| Symantec offers a suite of corporate and consumer security products including a firewall application. The firewall application includes a SYMDNS.SYS driver, which is responsible for validating DNS and NBNS requests and responses. There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the routine responsible for processing incoming DNS packets. By supplying a specially crafted DNS resource record containing an overly long canonical name (CNAME) value, an attacker could cause a stack overflow allowing arbitrary code execution.  According to the [Symantec Advisory](http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/security/Content/2004.05.12.html), the following products are affected:***Consumer:****Symantec Norton Internet Security and Professional 2002, 2003, 2004**Symantec Norton Personal Firewall 2002, 2003, 2004**Symantec Norton AntiSpam 2004****Corporate:****Symantec Client Firewall 5.01, 5.1.1**Symantec Client Security 1.0, 1.1, 2.0(SCF 7.1)* |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges on a vulnerable system**.** |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**  Symantec recommends that clients running corporate versions of the affected products apply patches obtained through their appropriate support channels.**Use LiveUpdate**Symantec recommends that clients running consumer versions of the affected products use the LiveUpdate feature to ensure all updates are installed. According to [Symantec](http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/security/Content/2004.05.12.html), this can be done as follows:     + Open any installed Symantec product + Click on LiveUpdate in the toolbar + Run LiveUpdate until Symantec LiveUpdate indicated that all installed Symantec products are up-to-date + Depending on the application, system may require a reboot to effectively update available fixes |
