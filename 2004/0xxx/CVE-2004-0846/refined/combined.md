## Vulnerability Details

#### Excel Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0846:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Excel. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Excel Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0846

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. At this point a user could be exploited.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
* The vulnerability can not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful through e-mail, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* Excel 2001 for Mac users and Excel v. X for Mac users are prompted to download an Excel file before they open it. Therefore, a user may not be exploited by an attacker upon an initial visit to a web site.
* Office XP Service Pack 3 is not affected by this vulnerability.
* Office 2003 and Office 2003 Service Pack 1 are not affected by this vulnerability.
* Excel 2004 for Mac is not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Excel Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0846

None.

#### FAQ for Excel Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0846:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

1. [Download the administrative version of this security update](https://download.microsoft.com/download/b/0/3/b03abaa0-dd54-4223-b43e-130d338678b1/office2000-kb873372-fullfile-enu.exe).
2. Click **Save this program to disk**, and then click **OK**.
3. Click **Save**.
4. Using Windows Explorer, locate the folder that contains the saved file and run the following command line to extract the .msp file:

*[path\name of EXE file]* /c /t:C:\AdminUpdate

**Note**  Double-clicking the .exe file does not extract the .msp file; it applies the update to the local computer. In order to update an administrative image, you must first extract the .msp file.

1. Click **Yes** to accept the License Agreement.
2. Click **Yes** if you are prompted to create the folder.
3. If you are familiar with the procedure for updating your administrative installation, click **Start**, and then click **Run**. Type the following command in the **Open** box:

msiexec /a Admin Path\MSI File /p C:\adminUpdate\MSP File SHORTFILENAMES=TRUE

Where Admin Path is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\Office2000), MSI File is the .msi database package for the application (for example, Data1.msi), and MSP File is the name of the administrative update (for example, SHAREDff.msp).

**Note** You can append /**qb+** to the command line so that the **Administrative Installation** dialog box and the **End User License Agreement** dialog box do not appear.

1. Click **Next** in the provided dialog box. Do not change your CD Key, installation location, or company name in the provided dialog box.
2. Click **I accept the terms in the License Agreement**, and then click **Install**.

At this point, your administrative installation point is updated. Next, you must update the workstations that were originally installed from this administrative installation. To do this, please review the Workstation Deployment section. Any new installations that you run from this administrative installation point will include the update.

**Warning** Any workstation that was originally installed from this administrative installation before you installed the update cannot use this administrative installation for actions like repairing Office or adding new features until you complete the steps in the Workstation Deployment section for this workstation.

**Workstation Deployment Information**

To deploy the update to the client workstations, click **Start**, and then click **Run**. Type the following command in the **Open** box:

msiexec /i Admin Path\MSI File /qb REINSTALL=Feature List REINSTALLMODE=vomu

where Admin Path is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\Office2000), MSI File is the ,msi database package for the application (for example, Data1.msi), and Feature List is the list of feature names (case sensitive) that must be reinstalled for the update. To install all features, you can use **REINSTALL=ALL**.

**Note**  Administrators working in managed environments can find complete resources for deploying Office updates in an organization on the [Office Admin Update Center](https://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/updates/default.htm). On the home page of that site, look in the **Update Strategies** section for the software version you are updating. The [Windows Installer Documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21685) also provides additional information about the parameters supported by the Windows Installer.

**Administrative Installation File Information**

The English version of this update has the file attributes (or later) that are listed in the following table. The dates and times for these files are listed in coordinated universal time (UTC). When you view the file information, it is converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use the **Time Zone** tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.

Office 2000 and Excel 2000:

```
Date Time Version Size File name
----------------------------------------------------------
09-Aug-2004 19:09 9.00.00.8924 7168045 Excel.exe

```

**Verifying Update Installation**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. This tool allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note**  Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  + Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  + In the **Search Results pane**, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  + In the **All or part of the file name box**, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  + In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

    **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  + On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

  **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
