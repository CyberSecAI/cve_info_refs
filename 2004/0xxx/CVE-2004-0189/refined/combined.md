________________________________________________________________________

Package:             squid
Vulnerability:       URL concealement
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= squid-2.5.4-20040116     >= squid-2.5.5-20040301
OpenPKG 2.0          <= squid-2.5.4-2.0.0        >= squid-2.5.4-2.0.1
OpenPKG 1.3          <= squid-2.5.3-1.3.0        >= squid-2.5.3-1.3.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a security advisory [[0]](#0) from the vendor, a vulnerability
  exists in the URL unescaping logic of the Squid Web Proxy Cache
  [[1]](#1). This bug could allow an attacker to bypass certain access
  controls by inserting a NUL character into decoded URLs. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2004-0189 [[2]](#2) to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
  -q squid". If you have the "squid" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade
  it (see Solution). [3][[4]](#4)

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][[6]](#6), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][[8]](#8) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[9]](#9), build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [[3]](#3) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [[4]](#4). For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.0, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.0/UPD
  ftp> get squid-2.5.4-2.0.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig squid-2.5.4-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild squid-2.5.4-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/squid-2.5.4-2.0.1.*.rpm

# Squid ACL [url\_regex] bypass vulnerability — GLSA **200403-11**

Squid versions 2.0 through to 2.5.STABLE4 could allow a remote attacker to
bypass Access Control Lists by sending a specially-crafted URL request
containing '%00': in such circumstances; the url\_regex ACL may not properly
detect the malicious URL, allowing the attacker to effectively bypass the
ACL.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-proxy/squid** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5.5** |

### Background

Squid is a fully-featured Web Proxy Cache designed to run on Unix systems
that supports proxying and caching of HTTP, FTP, and other URLs, as well as
SSL support, cache hierarchies, transparent caching, access control lists
and many other features.

### Description

A bug in Squid allows users to bypass certain access controls by passing a
URL containing "%00" which exploits the Squid decoding function.
This may insert a NUL character into decoded URLs, which may allow users to
bypass url\_regex access control lists that are enforced upon them.

In such a scenario, Squid will insert a NUL character after
the"%00" and it will make a comparison between the URL to the end
of the NUL character rather than the contents after it: the comparison does
not result in a match, and the user's request is not denied.

### Impact

Restricted users may be able to bypass url\_regex access control lists that
are enforced upon them which may cause unwanted network traffic as well as
a route for other possible exploits. Users of Squid 2.5STABLE4 and below
who require the url\_regex features are recommended to upgrade to 2.5STABLE5
to maintain the security of their infrastructure.

### Workaround

A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are advised
to upgrade to the latest version of Squid.

### Resolution

Squid can be updated as follows:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-proxy/squid-2.5.5"
 # emerge ">=net-proxy/squid-2.5.5"
```

Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2004:1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Advisory ID: SQUID-2004:1
Date: February 29, 2004
Summary: Squid-2.5.STABLE5 fixes and features for
URL encoding tricks.
Affected versions: Squid-2.x up to and including 2.5.STABLE4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2004\_1.txt
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Problem Description:
This memo discusses two important changes to Squid that
deal with URL encoding issues. These changes are available
in Squid version 2.5.STABLE5.
The first is a workaround for a recently-discovered Microsoft
Internet Explorer bug. The MSIE bug causes certain specially
crafted URLs to be incorrectly displayed. In particular, the
user sees one hostname, while the request is sent to a different
origin server. This bug is triggered by creating a URL that has
a hostname in the userinfo credentials field followed by an
encoded, non-printable control character. (For additional
information, see http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/652278)
To help address this problem, Squid now includes a new access
control type that can match patterns in the userinfo field.
The second fixes a bug in Squid that allows users to bypass
certain access controls. Squid versions 2.5.STABLE4 and earlier
contain a bug in the "%xx" URL decoding function. It may insert
a NUL character into decoded URLs, which may allow users to
bypass url\_regex ACLs.
You can also find information on the changes by visiting our
patch archive for version Squid-2.5.STABLE5:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v2/2.5/bugs/
------------------------------------------------------------------
Severity:
The MSIE bug does not pose any security problems to Squid itself.
However, it does allow your users to be fooled into visiting a
malicious site. To block such URLs with Squid, you can use the
new 'urllogin' ACL type:
acl UserInfoControlChar urllogin [[:cntrl:]]
http\_access deny UserInfoControlChar
NOTE: regular expression libraries may vary from system to
system. Please double-check that the "[[:cntrl:]]" works on your
particular operating system.
The Squid decoding bug may allow clever users to bypass your
access controls that use 'url\_regex' ACL types. If "%00" appears
in the URL, previous Squid versions insert a NUL character when
decoding. For example, consider this access control
configuration:
acl BadSite url\_regex www\.example\.com
http\_access deny BadSite
and this URL requested by a user:
http://foo%00@www.example.com/
The vulnerable Squid will insert a NUL character after "foo" and
make a comparison between "http://foo" and "www\.example\.com".
The comparison does not result in a match, and the user's request
is not denied.
This bug has been fixed by leaving any occurrences of "%00" in
place while decoding.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Updated Packages:
The Squid-2.5.STABLE5 release contains fixes for these
problems. You can download the Squid-2.5.STABLE5 release from
ftp://ftp.squid-cache.org/pub/archive/2.5/
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v2/2.5/
or the mirrors (may take a while before all mirrors are updated).
For a list of mirror sites see
http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/ftp-mirrors.html
http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/http-mirrors.html
Individual patches to the mentioned issues can be found from our
patch archive for version Squid-2.5.STABLE4
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v2/2.5/bugs/
The patches should also apply with only a minimal effort to
earlier Squid 2.5 versions if required.
If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please
refer to the package vendor for availability information on
updated packages.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Determining if your version is vulnerable:
To determine which version of Squid you are using, run the command
squid -v
You are likely to be vulnerable to these issues if you are
running version 2.5.STABLE4 or earlier.
If you are using a binary or otherwise pre-packaged version
please verify with your vendor on which versions are affected as
some vendors ship earlier versions with the needed patches
applied. Note that unless you have upgraded to a version
released after 2003-01-14 you are most likely vulnerable to
these issues.
There is no easy means to determine if your version is affected
other than by the Squid version number.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Other versions of Squid:
Versions prior to the 2.5 series are deprecated, please update
to Squid-2.5.STABLE5 if you are using a version older than 2.5.
These changes have also been made to the Squid-3 source tree.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Workarounds:
To address the MSIE URL display bug, you may want to upgrade your
Explorer installations if and when a patch is available from
Microsoft.
You may be able to work around the MSIE bug by developing a
Squid redirector. When the redirector program detects a
suspicious URL (e.g., with control characters in the userinfo
field), it can redirect the user to a local page that describes
the issue.
The best way to avoid Squid's "%00" bug is to not use any
url\_regex ACL types. You may want to use dst\_domain and/or
urlpath\_regex types instead.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Contact details for the Squid project:
For installation / upgrade support: Your first point of contact
should be your binary package vendor.
If your install is built from the original squid sources, then
the squid-users@squid-cache.org mailing list is your primary
support point. (see
for subscription details).
For bug reporting, particularly security related bugs the
squid-bugs@squid-cache.org mailing list is the appropriate forum.
It's a closed list (though anyone can post) and security related
bug reports are treated in confidence until the impact has been
established. For non security related bugs, the squid bugzilla
database should be used .
