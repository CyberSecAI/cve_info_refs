Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Buffer Overflows:**  The `auth_ident()` function in `auth.c` uses `sscanf()` with `%s` format specifiers, which are vulnerable to buffer overflows if the input string exceeds the buffer's size. It should have used  `%63s` to limit the input string size.
*   **Format String Bugs:** The `syslog()` calls in `info()` (log.c), `anubis_error()` (errs.c), and `ssl_error()` (ssl.c) use user-supplied strings as the format string argument instead of as data, leading to format string vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:**  Insecure use of `sscanf()` with unbounded `%s` format strings allows for writing past buffer boundaries.
*   **Format String Vulnerability:** Using user-controlled data directly as a format string argument allows attackers to read from and potentially write to arbitrary memory locations via format string specifiers such as `%n`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Both buffer overflows and format string bugs can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the system running GNU Anubis. Because Anubis often runs as root before dropping privileges, successful exploitation could result in root access.
*   **Denial of Service:** Exploiting the vulnerabilities can also lead to crashes and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **IDENT Server:** The primary attack vector is via interaction with a malicious IDENT server. Anubis connects to the client's IDENT server for more information, which allows an attacker to send crafted responses that trigger the vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted response to Anubis when it connects to an IDENT server. This means the attacker either needs to control the IDENT server that Anubis connects to, or the attacker's host should be the one to which Anubis is trying to connect to (e.g., if anubis acts as a proxy).
*   **Understanding of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable code points and how to craft specific payloads to trigger the overflow or format string bugs.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a simple Perl script (`anubis-crasher.pl`) that demonstrates how to trigger these vulnerabilities using either a buffer overflow or format string payload.
*   The severity of the format string vulnerability is increased by setting `termlevel` to `VERBOSE` or `DEBUG`, as more data will then be logged with the vulnerable `syslog()` calls.
*   Patches for the vulnerabilities were released by the vendor for versions 3.6.2 and 3.9.93.
