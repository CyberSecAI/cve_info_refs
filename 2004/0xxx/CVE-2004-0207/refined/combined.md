**I am still using Windows XP, but extended security update support ended on September 30th, 2004. However, this bulletin has a security update for this operating system version. Why is that?**

The original version of Windows XP, commonly known as Windows XP Gold or Windows XP Release to Manufacturing (RTM) version, reached the end of its extended security update support life cycle on September 30, 2004. However, the end-of-life occurred very recently. In this case, the majority of the steps that are required to address this vulnerability were completed before this date. Therefore, we have decided to release a security update for this operating system version as part of this security bulletin.
We do not anticipate doing this for future vulnerabilities that may affect this operating system version, but we reserve the right to produce updates and to make these updates available when necessary. It should be a priority for customers who have this operating system version to migrate to supported operating system versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Service Pack Product Life Cycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?pr=lifesupsps).

MS04-011 helps protect against the vulnerability that is discussed in that bulletin, but does not address this new vulnerability. This update does not replace MS04-011. You must install this update and the update that is provided as part of the MS04-011 security bulletin to help protect your system against both vulnerabilities.

#### Graphics Rendering Engine Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0209:

A remote code execution vulnerability in the rendering of Windows Metafile (WMF) and Enhanced Metafile (EMF) image formats that could allow remote code execution on an affected system. Any program that renders WMF or EMF images on the affected systems could be vulnerable to this attack. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Graphics Rendering Engine Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0209:

* The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who persuaded a user to open a specially crafted file or to view a folder that contains the specially crafted image. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a malicious file, except potentially through previewing an email message.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* Windows XP Service Pack 2 is not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Graphics Rendering Engine Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0209:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or later, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or later, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or later and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about enabling this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [307594](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [291387](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
    **Note** Manually viewing these pictures could allow remote code execution if you are using a vulnerable application or operating system.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ for Graphics Rendering Engine Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0209:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges. This vulnerability could also be used to attempt to perform a local elevation of privilege or a remote denial of service.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the way that the Graphics Rendering Engine processes Windows Metafile (WMF) and Enhanced Metafile (EMF) image formats.

**What are Windows Metafile (WMF) and Enhanced Metafile (EMF) image formats?**

A WMF image is a 16-bit metafile format that can contain both vector information and bitmap information. It is optimized for the Windows operating system. An EMF image is a 32-bit format that can contain both vector information and bitmap information. This format is an improvement over the Windows Metafile format and contains extended features.

For more information about image types and formats, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [320314](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;320314). Additional information about these file formats is also available at the [MSDN Library Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms534574.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

Any program that renders the affected image types could be vulnerable to this attack. Here are some examples:

* An attacker could host a malicious Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site.
* An attacker could create an HTML e-mail message that has a specially crafted image attached. The specially crafted image could be designed to exploit this vulnerability through Microsoft Outlook or through Outlook Express 6. An attacker could persuade the user to view the HTML e-mail message.
* An attacker could embed a specially crafted image in an Office document and then persuade the user to view the document.
* An attacker could add a specially crafted image to the local file system or onto a network share and then persuade the user to preview the folder.
* An attacker could locally log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially-designed program that could exploit the vulnerability, and thereby gain complete control over the affected system.

An attacker could also access the affected component through another vector. For example, an attacker could log on to the system interactively or by using another program that passes parameters to the vulnerable component (locally or remotely). To locally exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially-designed application that could exploit the vulnerability, and thereby gain complete control over the affected system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability could be exploited on the affected systems by an attacker who persuaded a user to open a specially crafted file or to view a folder that contains the specially crafted image. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a specially crafted file, except potentially through previewing an email message.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially-designed program that could exploit the vulnerability. This could cause the system to stop responding and therefore cause a denial of service condition.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers are only at risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative credentials are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

No. An attacker must be able to log on to the specific system targeted for attack. An attacker cannot load and run a program remotely by using this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Windows kernel resets some values in some CPU data structures.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [824994](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=824994).

**Verifying Update Installation**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. This tool allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP1\KB840987\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 840987 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Verifying Update Installation**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. This tool allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB840987\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 840987 security update into the Windows installation source files.

========================================================================

== Overview ==

As explained in my presentation at Blackhat earlier this year, attacks
against the windows GUI do not stop with sending messages. In that
presentation I talked about the exploitative usage of the SetProp() API
method. The SetWindowLong()/SetWindowLongPtr() API's can also be used
to exploit certain applications for arbitrary advantage.

What advantage depends heavily on the application been targeted.

== Background ==

The SetWindowLong() function is documented in MSDN as;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SetWindowLong function changes an attribute of the specified window.
The function also sets a 32-bit (long) value at the specified offset into
the extra window memory of a window.

LONG SetWindowLong(
  HWND hWnd,       // handle of window
  int nIndex,      // offset of value to set
  LONG dwNewLong   // new value
);

Parameters
hWnd
  Handle to the window and, indirectly, the class to which the window
  belongs.
nIndex
  Specifies the zero-based offset to the value to be set. Valid values
  are in the range zero through the number of bytes of extra window
  memory, minus 4;  for example, if you specified 12 or more bytes of
  extra memory, a value of 8 would be an index to the third 32-bit integer.
  To set any other value, specify one of the following values:
  Value          Action
  GWL_EXSTYLE    Sets a new extended window style.
  GWL_STYLE      Sets a new window style.
  GWL_WNDPROC    Sets a new address for the window procedure.
  GWL_HINSTANCE  Sets a new application instance handle.
  GWL_ID         Sets a new identifier of the window.
  GWL_USERDATA   Sets the 32-bit value associated with the window. Each
                 window has a corresponding 32-bit value intended for use
                 by the application that created the window.

The following values are also available when the hWnd parameter identifies
a dialog box:
  Value          Action
  DWL_DLGPROC    Sets the new address of the dialog box procedure.
  DWL_MSGRESULT  Sets the return value of a message processed in the
                 dialog box procedure.
  DWL_USER       Sets new extra information that is private to the
                 application, such as handles or pointers.

dwNewLong
  Specifies the replacement value.

Remarks
  The SetWindowLong function fails if the window specified by the hWnd
  parameter does not belong to the same process as the calling thread.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The functions compliment is the GetWindowLong() function, which is used
to retrieve a value.

Even though the remarks section is documented as written above, it is not
a true statement.

As with the SendMessage() function (as used by standard shatter attacks)
any user can call the SetWindowLong() function to alter the data stored
in the window memory.

== Exploitation ==

We founds multiple third party and core windows services that used the
memory space pointed to by the GWL_USERDATA, to store specific data. In
some cases this data could be manipulated to gain execution control.

Since each application stores different information in this memory and
therefore the exploitation differs, we can not explain them all. We will
however give a quick example of how execution control could be obtained.

We discovered that [Service X], that did not normally have a window, could
be enticed into generating an error that would display a window. The
service stored a pointer to a lookup table in the window memory pointed to
by GWL_USERDATA. This lookup table held the address of functions, and was
later used to retrieve an address and pass it to a CALL instruction.

By using the process mapped heap, as explained in my Blackhat presentation,
it was possible to place our shellcode into a known location. We could also
construct a new lookup table, pointing to our shellcode, in a known
location.

Then by using SetWIndowLongPtr() API we replaced the pointer to the lookup
table with the address of our new lookup table. The service would use our
lookup table and execution would therefore reach the shellcode.

== Solutions ==

- Install the vendor supplied patch.
- Interactive processes should not run under a higher level account.

## Microsoft Windows contains vulnerability in Window Management API

#### Vulnerability Note VU#218526

Original Release Date: 2004-10-13 | Last Revised: 2004-10-13

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows window application programming interfaces (APIs) could allow a local attacker to gain elevated privileges on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft Windows contains a vulnerability in the window management application programming interface (API) functions. These functions are used to change various properties of a program window including the size and name of the window. Typically, an application should only be able to change the properties of another application running with the same level of privileges. There is a vulnerability in several of the Window Management API functions that could allow one application to modify the properties of another application that is running with a higher level of privileges. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local, authenticated attacker could execute an application that modifies the properties of another application running at a higher level of privileges to gain complete control of the vulnerable system. |
