Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2004-0207:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Windows Window Management API functions, specifically how they handle property changes of program windows. 
- These APIs allow programs to modify properties like window size and name. 
- The core issue is that these API functions do not properly restrict programs from modifying properties of other programs running at a higher privilege level.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Privilege Check:** The Window Management API functions lack sufficient checks to ensure that a program can only modify the properties of other programs running at the same privilege level.
- **SetWindowLong/SetWindowLongPtr Abuse:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to use `SetWindowLong` or `SetWindowLongPtr` to modify the properties of a window and especially the `GWL_USERDATA` value.
- **GWL_USERDATA misuse**: Applications and services use the `GWL_USERDATA` to store application specific data. Manipulating this data can cause the application to execute code with the application's privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows a local attacker to elevate their privileges to the level of the targeted application.
- **Complete System Control:** Attackers can gain complete control of the affected system, including:
    - Installing programs
    - Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    - Creating new accounts with full privileges

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access Required:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system.
- **Malicious Program:** The attacker needs to execute a specially crafted program to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Targeting specific memory locations:** The attacker must know the location of the data and the expected format in order to gain control of the program's execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local, Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be a legitimate user on the system.
- **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker must be able to run a program on the vulnerable system.
- **Knowledge of the Windows API** The attacker must know how to call the vulnerable functions and how they affect the program in order to exploit it.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability was privately reported, with Brett Moore of Security-Assessment.com credited for discovery.
- The issue affects Windows NT 4.0, 2000, XP (including SP1), and Server 2003.
- Windows 98, 98SE, and ME are affected, but it is not considered a critical vulnerability on those platforms.
- A patch is available from Microsoft to address this issue. The patch blocks modification of properties of higher privilege level windows.
