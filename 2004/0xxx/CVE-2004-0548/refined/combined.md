Introduction
#############

Aspell was intended as a more accurate and robust
replacement for the popular ispell package, and was
written by GNU.  Aspell includes a small utility for
compressing and decompressing wordlists before
processing by aspell, namely 'word-list-compress'.

Due to insufficient bounds checking, a malformed
wordlist can cause for a stack based buffer overflow
to occur, possibly allowing execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the invoking user.

Details
########

The word-list-compress utility provides two options --
decompression of wordlists and compression of
wordlists.  When processing wordlists supplied with
either option, due to lack of bounds checking, a
buffer overflow could occur, should a word exceeding
256 bytes be present in the user-supplied wordlist.

The offending code lays below.

--- vulnerable code ---
else if (argv[1][[0]](#0) == 'c') {

    char s1[256];
    char s2[256];
    char * prev = s2;
    char * cur = s1;
    *prev = '\0';

    SETBIN (stdout);

  /* BUG 1: no checks are made to prevent getting
     more than 256 bytes via get_word() */
    while (get_word(stdin, cur)) {
      int i = 0;
      /* get the length of the prefix */
      while (prev[i] != '\0' && cur[i] != '\0' &&
prev[i] == cur[i])
	++i;
      if (i > 31) {
	putc('\0', stdout);
      }
      putc(i+1, stdout);
      fputs(cur+i, stdout);
      if (cur == s1) {
	prev = s1; cur = s2;
      } else {
	prev = s2; cur = s1;
      }
    }
    return 0;

  } else if (argv[1][[0]](#0) == 'd') {

    char cur[256];
    int i;
    int c;

    SETBIN (stdin);

    i = getc(stdin);
    while (i != -1 ) {
      if (i == 0)
	i = getc(stdin);
      --i;

      /* BUG 2: no check is made to prevent against
         writing more than 256 bytes into the fixed
         length buffers */
      while ((c = getc(stdin)) > 32)
	cur[i++] = (char)c;
      cur[i] = '\0';
      fputs(cur, stdout);
      putc('\n', stdout);
      i = c;
    }
    return 0;
--- EOF ---

The get_word() routine is called continually when
acting upon 'c' (compress) until the user-supplied
string ends.  In option 'd' (decompress), characters
are written into a fixed length buffer ('cur').
However, no checks in the while() loops are present to
ensure that the number of characters in each 'word'
exceed 256 bytes, thus resulting in a potential buffer
overflow, such should a condition arise.

If a user was able to influence the contents of
another users wordlist/dictionary file, the user could
craft a malicious word entry exceeding 256 bytes to
execute arbitrary code.  When word-list-compress is
then called by a targetted user, the malicious
wordlist entry would trigger to overflow, optionally
running arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user.

Exploitation
##############

Assuming a user had sufficient privileges to influence
the contents of a users wordlist, a malicious word
entry could be crafted in the form of a normal exploit
buffer.

To reproduce the issues described above, issue the
below commands.

---
bash$ echo `perl -e 'print "a"x1000'` |
word-list-compress c

bash$ echo `perl -e 'print "a"x1000'` |
word-list-compress d
---

Each subsequent command should produce a segmentation
fault.  By examining the core file, it should be
apparent that influence of program flow is easily
possible.

The major mitigating factor is the access the
malicious user requires to a users dictionary file.
However, if a malicious user could social engineer a
user into using their specially crafted wordlist with
word-list-compress, an issue would still exist.

Solution
#########

Kevin Atkinson, package maintainer, was contacted a
significant amount of time ago, but no reply was
received, and the issues still exist in the latest
release of aspell.

The below patch file fixes the issues.

Apply the patch, and rebuild aspell.

Thank you for your time.

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017

# aspell: Buffer overflow in word-list-compress — GLSA **200406-14**

A bug in the aspell utility word-list-compress can allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/aspell** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.50.5-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.50.5-r4** |

### Background

aspell is a popular spell-checker. Dictionaries are available for many
languages.

### Description

aspell includes a utility for handling wordlists called
word-list-compress. This utility fails to do proper bounds checking
when processing words longer than 256 bytes.

### Impact

If an attacker could entice a user to handle a wordlist containing very
long word lengths it could result in the execution of arbitrary code
with the permissions of the user running the program.

### Workaround
