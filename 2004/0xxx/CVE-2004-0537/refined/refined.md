**Verification:**

The provided content from marc.info directly relates to the vulnerability described in CVE-2004-0537, which involves a phishing vulnerability in Opera browser leveraging a crafted favicon.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from Opera's implementation of the "shortcut icon" (favicon) feature. Unlike other browsers, Opera allows favicons with large widths.
*   **Weakness:** Opera's flexible favicon width handling, combined with how it displays the URL in the address bar, is the primary weakness. The browser allows an attacker to create a favicon that visually mimics a legitimate URL. Additionally, the address bar display allows manipulation through padding with spaces, further obscuring the real URL
*  **Attack Vector:** The attack is carried out by tricking users to click on a link that points to a malicious website. The malicious website would then include a specially crafted favicon.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could successfully impersonate trusted domains, such as banks or webmail services, leading to identity theft, credit card fraud, or other malicious activities by tricking users into entering sensitive information on a fake website that appears legitimate due to the manipulated favicon and address bar.
*   **Required Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to host a website.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to create a favicon image that appears to be a legitimate URL.
    *   The attacker needs to entice a user to visit the malicious website.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory notes that a proof-of-concept demonstration was made available.
*   Opera was informed of the vulnerability on May 19, 2004, and released version 7.51 on June 3, 2004, to address it.
*   The vulnerability was tested on Opera 7.23 and 7.50.
