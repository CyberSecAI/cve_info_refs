How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

GreyMagic Security Advisory GM#007-OP
=====================================

By GreyMagic Software, 03 Jun 2004.

Available in HTML format at
<http://security.greymagic.com/security/advisories/gm007-op/>.

Topic: Phishing for Opera.

Discovery date: 16 May 2004.

Affected applications:
======================

Opera 7.50 and prior.

Introduction:
=============

Most browsers today implement a "Shortcut Icon" (favicon) feature. This
feature gives web-sites the option to add a small icon to the address bar
and/or favorites.

Opera also implements this feature. However, unlike other browsers, Opera
allows the use of icons that may be large in width.

Discussion:
===========

It is possible to use this feature in Opera to fool users into believing
that they are in a domain they trust (their bank, web-mail, etc) while
serving and receiving content in a hostile domain. Thereby enabling identity
theft, credit card scams and more.

This can be done by creating an icon that contains the text of the desired
site, which would be similar in appearance to the way Opera shows addresses
in the address bar.

This alone, however, is not enough, as it will cause the real address to
appear to the right of the fake address. Unfortunately, this too can be
circumvented by tricking Opera into showing the right-hand side of the
attacking URL, while filling that side with spaces.

The result is a very convincing fake address appearing in the address bar.

Exploit:
========

Create an image that looks like an address in Opera's address bar and use
the following element to include it in a page:

<link rel="shortcut icon" href="linkToFakeAddress.gif">

Demonstration:
==============

A proof-of-concept demonstration of this issue is available at
<http://security.greymagic.com/security/advisories/gm007-op/>.

Solution:
=========

GreyMagic informed Opera of the vulnerability on 19-May-2004. A new version
(7.51) was released on 03-Jun-2004 to address this problem.

Tested on:
==========

Opera 7.23.
Opera 7.50.
