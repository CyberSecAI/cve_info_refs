Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2004-0850:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `star` utility, when configured to use `ssh` for remote tape access, fails to drop the effective user ID (euid) when calling the program specified by the `RSH` environment variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Privilege Handling:** The primary vulnerability is that `star` does not properly drop privileges before executing external programs defined via the `RSH` environment variable.
*   **Use of Environment Variable:** Relying on the `RSH` environment variable for specifying the remote access program creates an opportunity for a malicious user to inject their own program.
*   **Setuid Root Program:** When `star` is setuid root, this vulnerability escalates to a serious issue because the attacker's injected program will execute with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution as Root:** A local user can execute arbitrary code with root privileges by manipulating the `RSH` environment variable to point to a malicious script or program.
*   **Unauthorized Root Access:** This allows an attacker to gain unauthorized root access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local user-level access to the system.
*   **Environment Variable Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to set or modify the `RSH` environment variable before running the `star` program.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a local user account.
*   The attacker must be able to influence or control the `RSH` environment variable.
*   The `star` binary must be setuid root for the exploit to grant root privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is present in versions of `star` prior to `1.5_alpha46`.
* The fix involves upgrading `star` to the patched version.
* The vulnerability is specific to configurations of `star` that use `ssh` for remote access.
* The vulnerability is described in Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 200409-11.
* Multiple vendors (including Debian, TurboLinux, and others) were notified, with varying responses. Some vendors were affected while others were not.
* CERT VU#339089 also covers this issue.
