## CVS "history" command may disclose sensitive information

#### Vulnerability Note VU#579225

Original Release Date: 2004-08-17 | Last Revised: 2004-08-19

---

### Overview

A vulnerability exists in the history command of Concurrent Versions System (CVS). If exploited, this vulnerability could disclose sensitive information about files and directories on an affected system to a remote, authenticated CVS user.

### Description

| Concurrent Versions System ([CVS](https://www.cvshome.org/)) is a source code maintenance system that is widely used by open-source software development projects. It provides a history command that displays reports on cvs commands that have been executed on files or directories in the source repository. The history command supports a -X command line switch, which is designed to allow a user to specify the name of the history file to be used. This command line switch contains an information disclosure vulnerability. When specifying a directory or filename to the -X command line switch, the error message that is returned could allow an attacker to determine the existence and accessibility of arbitrary files or directories on an affected system. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, authenticated CVS user could determine if arbitrary files or directories exist on an affected system and whether the CVS daemon has privileges to access them. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch or upgrade**  Apply the appropriate patch or upgrade as specified by your vendor. This issue has been resolved in Stable CVS Version [1.11.17](https://ccvs.cvshome.org/servlets/NewsItemView?newsItemID=110) and CVS Feature Version [1.12.9](https://ccvs.cvshome.org/servlets/NewsItemView?newsItemID=111). |
| --- |

| **Disable the CVS server**Until patches are available and can be applied, consider disabling the CVS server.**Block or restrict access**Block or restrict access to the CVS server from untrusted hosts and networks. The CVS server typically listens on 2401/tcp, but it may use another port or protocol.**Limit the CVS server privileges**     + Configure CVS server to run in a restricted (chroot) environment. + Run CVS servers with the minimum set of privileges required on the host file system. + Provide separate systems for development (write) and public/anonymous (read-only) CVS access. + Host public/anonymous CVS servers on single-purpose, secured systems.  Note that some of these workarounds will only limit the scope and impact of possible attacks. |
