The provided content is related to CVE-2004-0778.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `history` command in CVS allows specifying a history file using the `-X` command-line switch. This switch is vulnerable to an information disclosure issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The error message returned when specifying a directory or filename with the `-X` switch reveals the existence and accessibility of arbitrary files and directories on the system.

**Impact of exploitation:** A remote, authenticated CVS user can determine the existence of arbitrary files and directories and whether the CVS daemon has the privileges to access them.

**Attack vectors:** A remote, authenticated CVS user can use the `history` command with the `-X` switch specifying arbitrary files or directories.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a remote, authenticated user of the CVS server.
