## Which Perl Versions Does ActiveState Support?

#

ActiveState offers ongoing support and security updates for current and non-EOL versions of Perl. Extended support is available for EOL versions of Perl except Perl 5.8 – 5.14, for which we provide access to our previously built ActivePerl distributions only. Access to older versions of ActivePerl is available starting at our Team tier. Maintenance and support backed by a service-level agreement are available at our Enterprise tier. Learn more about our [licensing options here](/solutions/pricing/).
Support varies across platforms/operating systems. More details below.

## Perl Versions

All usage of ActivePerl beyond developer workstations requires commercial licensing. The table below outlines the level of support we provide with commercial licensing for each version.
**Maintained & Supported**: Module and security updates to known CVE’s provided on a regular basis. Available with Enterprise licensing.
**Licensing Only**: These versions have passed End of Life (EOL). As such, access to ActivePerl is provided “as-is”, but these versions will no longer be updated.

Perl win32_stat Function Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 04.05.04
[www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=93&type=vulnerabilities](http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=93&type=vulnerabilities)
April 5, 2004

I. BACKGROUND

Perl is a popular programming language due to its text manipulation
capabilities and rapid development cycle. It is open source, cross
platform and used for mission critical projects in the public and
private sector.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow in the 'win32_stat' function of
ActiveState's ActivePerl and Larry Wall's Perl could allow for the
execution of arbitrary commands.

If the filename passed to the function ends with a backslash character,
it is copied into a fixed length buffer. There is no check made on the
length of the string before the copy, allowing an excessively long
string to overwrite control information, allowing execution of arbitrary
code.

The problem specifically exists within the win32 wrapper to the stat()
routine and hence the Unix builds of Perl are not affected.

III. ANALYSIS

The 'win32_stat' function is a wrapper around the 'stat' function and
the file test operators ('-r', '-w', '-e', '-d' etc) on Win32 based
platforms.

If a web site contains a Perl script that uses any of these functions
with user supplied pathnames, it may be possible to remotely execute
commands.

IV. DETECTION

All versions of Perl for Win32 operating systems up to and including
5.8.3 are affected.

V. VENDOR RESPONSE

The fix will be incorporated into core Perl 5.8.4. Patches are currently
available at the following locations:

Committed to the Perl 5.9.x development branch:

   <http://public.activestate.com/cgi-bin/perlbrowse?patch=22466>

Integrated into Perl 5.8.x maintenance branch as part of:

   <http://public.activestate.com/cgi-bin/perlbrowse?patch=22552>

VI. CVE INFORMATION

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0377 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (<http://cve.mitre.org>), which standardizes names for
security problems.

## Perl vulnerable to buffer overflow in win32\_stat()

#### Vulnerability Note VU#722414

Original Release Date: 2004-06-09 | Last Revised: 2004-07-16

---

### Overview

A flaw in a standard function in some Perl distributions could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.

### Description

| The stat() Perl function, similar to the standard C stat() function, returns a list giving the status info for a file. Since the stat() function is UNIX-centric, some Perl distributions supply a function named win32\_stat() that provides a wrapper around the stat() function for systems running Perl on Windows operating systems. A buffer overflow flaw in the way win32\_stat() handles long filenames could allow an attacker to execute code on a system running an application that used the function.  Note that because this flaw exists in the Perl system itself, a vulnerability is only exposed through a Perl application that invokes win32\_stat() (either explicitly or implicitly) on a filename supplied by the user. Since the flawed code does not get complied into Perl builds for UNIX systems, only systems running Perl on Windows are affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of an application that uses the vulnerable function. The scope of the impact depends on how the affected application works. Applications that process filename input from the network, such as some web applications, would be vulnerable to a remote attacker. Applications that only process filename input from a local user would only be vulnerable to a local attacker. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**Patches have been developed to address this issue. For more information, see:<<http://public.activestate.com/cgi-bin/perlbrowse?patch=22466>> (for the 5.9.x branch)<<http://public.activestate.com/cgi-bin/perlbrowse?patch=22552>> (for the 5.8.x branch)Note that these patches require the user to recompile the Perl interpreter for their system after application. |
