Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the Debian Security Advisory DSA 586-1, which is related to CVE-2004-0983:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the CGI module of the Ruby programming language.
- A flaw exists in how the CGI module handles specially crafted requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the potential for an infinite loop to occur when processing malicious CGI requests.
- This vulnerability is triggered by the way the CGI module handles specific input, leading to the program getting stuck in a loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- By sending specially crafted requests, an attacker can cause the Ruby program to enter an infinite loop.
- This infinite loop consumes excessive CPU resources, effectively making the program unresponsive or unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote.
- An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to a vulnerable Ruby application using the CGI module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a Ruby application that is using the vulnerable CGI module.
- No specific privileges are mentioned, suggesting the attacker does not need to be authenticated or have special access to the target system.

**Additional Notes:**

- The advisory indicates that the issue is not Debian-specific and that the upstream Ruby developers have corrected the problem.
- Patched versions of the ruby package are provided for different Debian distributions (woody and sid), which addresses the vulnerability
- The advisory clearly states that an upgrade of ruby packages is recommended.
