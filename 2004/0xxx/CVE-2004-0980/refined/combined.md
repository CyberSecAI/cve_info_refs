# ez-ipupdate: Format string vulnerability — GLSA **200411-20**

ez-ipupdate contains a format string vulnerability that could lead to
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **3.0.11\_beta8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.0.11\_beta8-r1** |

### Background

ez-ipupdate is a utility for updating host name information for a large number of dynamic DNS services.

### Description

Ulf Harnhammar from the Debian Security Audit Project discovered a format string vulnerability in ez-ipupdate.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running ez-ipupdate, which could be the root user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ez-ipupdate users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/ez-ipupdate-3.0.11_beta8-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
November 12th, 2004                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : ez-ipupdate
Vulnerability  : format string
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0980

Ulf Härnhammar from the Debian Security Audit Project discovered a
format string vulnerability in ez-ipupdate, a client for many dynamic
DNS services.  This problem can only be exploited if ez-ipupdate is
running in daemon mode (most likely) with many but not all service
types.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11b5-1woody2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11b8-8.

We recommend that you upgrade your ez-ipupdate package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
