- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `rxgoogle.cgi` script fails to properly sanitize user input, specifically within the `parse` subroutine, leading to the injection of metacharacters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to inadequate input sanitization. The script does not filter out characters like `<` and `>`, which allows for the injection of malicious code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could steal user authentication cookies or inject malicious code into the search query, potentially tricking legitimate users into visiting malicious URLs.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted URL containing malicious Javascript code within the `query` parameter of the `rxgoogle.cgi` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with malicious JavaScript. No special privileges or specific network positions are required; the attacker only needs to persuade a user to visit the crafted URL.
