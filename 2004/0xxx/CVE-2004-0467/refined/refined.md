  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2004-0467",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Juniper routers handle specially crafted MPLS packets. These packets are immediately delivered to the Routing Engine (RE) for processing, even if the interface is not MPLS-enabled or the router is not configured for MPLS processing. This bypasses hardware limitations and filtering mechanisms.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of MPLS packets",
        "Lack of input validation or filtering for MPLS packets on non-MPLS interfaces",
        "Bypassing of hardware limitations and filtering mechanisms"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause severe operational disruption to affected Juniper routers, leading to an effective denial of routing service. This can manifest as lost routing protocol adjacencies, stalled or timed-out telnet and SSH sessions, and interfaces appearing to flap.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending specially crafted MPLS packets to a Juniper router.",
        "Attack can be performed by attackers directly connected to the router or remotely via transit Label Switch Routers (LSRs) within an MPLS-enabled network."
      ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted MPLS packets to the targeted Juniper router. The attacker does not need to be directly connected to an MPLS-enabled interface, and may be remote within an MPLS network."
