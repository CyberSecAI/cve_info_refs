### Background

Mozilla is a popular web browser that includes a mail and newsreader.
Epiphany is a web browser that uses Gecko, the Mozilla rendering
engine. Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird are respectively the
next-generation browser and mail client from the Mozilla project.

### Description

Mozilla-based products are vulnerable to multiple security issues.
Firstly routines handling the display of BMP images and VCards contain
an integer overflow and a stack buffer overrun. Specific pages with
long links, when sent using the "Send Page" function, and links with
non-ASCII hostnames could both cause heap buffer overruns.

Several issues were found and fixed in JavaScript rights handling:
untrusted script code could read and write to the clipboard, signed
scripts could build confusing grant privileges dialog boxes, and when
dragged onto trusted frames or windows, JavaScript links could access
information and rights of the target frame or window. Finally,
Mozilla-based mail clients (Mozilla and Mozilla Thunderbird) are
vulnerable to a heap overflow caused by invalid POP3 mail server
responses.

### Impact

An attacker might be able to run arbitrary code with the rights of the
user running the software by enticing the user to perform one of the
following actions: view a specially-crafted BMP image or VCard, use the
"Send Page" function on a malicious page, follow links with malicious
hostnames, drag multiple JavaScript links in a row to another window,
or connect to an untrusted POP3 mail server. An attacker could also use
a malicious page with JavaScript to disclose clipboard contents or
abuse previously-given privileges to request XPI installation
privileges through a confusing dialog.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround covering all vulnerabilities.

### Resolution

All users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv your-version
 # emerge your-version
```

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040115
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0
There is stack based bufferoverflow in mozilla mail when handling vcards.
The stack is quite screwed.
It is triggered by just previewing a specially crafted message.
Tested on mozilla 1.7 (because 1.7.2 fails to build due to missing directories),
but the code seems present in 1.7.2 and thunderbird 0.7 also.
Obviously the following code is quite fucked:
--------
addrbook/src/nsVCardObj.cpp
static void writeGroup(OFile \*fp, VObject \*o)
{
char buf1[256];
char buf2[256];
PL\_strcpy(buf1,NAME\_OF(o));
while ((o=isAPropertyOf(o,VCGroupingProp)) != 0) {
PL\_strcpy(buf2,STRINGZ\_VALUE\_OF(o));
PL\_strcat(buf2,".");
PL\_strcat(buf2,buf1);
PL\_strcpy(buf1,buf2);
}
appendsOFile(fp,buf1);
}
--------
To reproduce send the vcard fuckmicrosft.vcf (which will be shortly attached)
as attachment and then preview the message.

Heh, the email to security@mozilla kept crashing me every time I tried to open
it. I finally read the summary and checked the bug before trying to read the
mail again. I can reproduce a crash viewing Georgi's titled "[bug 257314](/show_bug.cgi?id=257314 "VERIFIED FIXED - stack based buffer overflow with vcards when previewing email message")" on a
Thunderbird branch build from yesterday.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: true

the same fucked code is in: other-licenses/libical/src/libicalvcal/vobject.c
<http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/other-licenses/libical/src/libicalvcal/vobject.c#1253>
probably it also should be fixed.

This is a patch to use string class instead of char arrays for

I checked the original libical package libical-0.24.RC4.tar.gz and it has the
same bad code as the one in other-licenses. Libical developers should be
notified about that, right?

least in SeaMonkey with calendar.

Patch for addrbook/src/nsVCardObj.cpp
I'm not a mailnews peer, let's get the r= from mscott;I'll sr=
scott: while you're reviewing, please check out nsDirPrefs.cpp
in the same directory which also has a lot of unchecked strcats and strcpys.
Less susceptible to a remote hacker, but is there any way these
prefs could exceed 128 chars? Seems possible since some are hostname
based and I've seen some exceptionally long hostnames (though rare).
The longest ldap pref I currently have is 60 chars so it's unlikely
to overflow by accident, but hackers are not accidental. ("Get your
free LDAP here! e-mail addresses of your favorite celebrities!").
Anyway, back to this...
>+ while ((o=isAPropertyOf(o,VCGroupingProp)) != 0) {
>+ buf.Insert(NS\_LITERAL\_CSTRING("."), 0);
>+ buf.Insert(STRINGZ\_VALUE\_OF(o), 0);
What are the guarantees about this data structure? Since Insert
is slow if we're sure o->val.strs is non-null you could
combine these using nsDependentString
but.Insert(nsDependentString(STRINGZ\_VALUE\_OF(o) +
NS\_LITERAL\_CSTRING("."), 0);
But what you have works and isn't going to be called much,
so unless we're sure I'm happy with the patch as-is

Patch for addrbook/src/nsVCardObj.cpp
I'm not positive that the old vcard string code can promise that these strings
are null terminated, so like Dan I'm afraid to use the nsDependentString
shortcut.
To answer Dan's other question, those other calls could be problematic too.
Maybe we should get another bug going for someone to step through the debugger
and take a closer look.

re: [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=257314#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - stack based buffer overflow with vcards when previewing email message") and [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=257314#c7 "VERIFIED FIXED - stack based buffer overflow with vcards when previewing email message") about fixing libical upstream
it looks like the bad code that georgi uncovered was already found and fixed by
KDE long ago.
unfortunately, it didn't make it to the libical CVS until shortley after their
last release :(
according to
<http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/freeassociation/libical/src/libicalvcal/vobject.c>
rev 1.4 of freeassociation/libical/src/libicalvcal/vobject.c was checked in on
12/16/02 with the following comment:
--
Fix possible buffer overflows. This comes from a code review of KDE.
Obtained from: Waldo Bastian <bastian@kde.org>
--
diff available at
<http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/freeassociation/libical/src/libicalvcal/vobject.c?r1=1.3&r2=1.4>
should waldo bastian also be given credit at
<http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/known-vulnerabilities.html> ?
