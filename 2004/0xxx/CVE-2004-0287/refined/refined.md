- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Xlight FTP Server when handling the RETR command with an excessively long parameter (greater than 260 characters).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in insufficient input validation for the RETR command's parameter. The server doesn't properly handle or check the length of the filename provided with the RETR command, leading to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, where the Xlight FTP server crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is sending a RETR command with a filename parameter exceeding 260 characters. This can be done via a standard FTP client or a custom script/tool.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable FTP server as an authenticated user. The attacker requires the ability to send FTP commands including the RETR command.
