| [Description](#c0)  David Alan Black    2002-08-02 21:37:30 UTC  ``` Setting XSESSION to "KDE" in rc.conf is supposed to trigger 'startkde'.  However, /etc/X11/chooser.sh does not handle the string "KDE" correctly, and therefore never finds the correct script in /etc/X11/Sessions.  Workaround: in rc.conf, instead of XSESSION="KDE", do XSESSION="kde-3.0.2".  This will result in chooser.sh finding the right startup script.  Here's a command-line test-run. (The blank line in the middle is the output of the first run of chooser.sh.)  root@laptop:/etc/X11# export XSESSION="KDE" root@laptop:/etc/X11# sh chooser.sh  root@laptop:/etc/X11# export XSESSION="kde-3.0.2" root@laptop:/etc/X11# sh chooser.sh /etc/X11/Sessions/kde-3.0.2 ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2002-08-02 22:02:25 UTC  ``` thats weird, XSESSION=KDE in rc.conf causes /etc/init.d/xdm to launch kdm for me  if you read /etc/init.d/xdm you'll see that it finds the correct binary for kdm  and then have init launch it  in other words, you're really not suppose to use rc.conf to setup chooser.sh ;)  rc.conf is used to setup /etc/init.d/xdm ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  David Alan Black    2002-08-04 08:47:21 UTC  ``` > ------- Additional Comments From vapier@netzero.com  2002-08-02 22:02 -------  > thats weird, XSESSION=KDE in rc.conf causes /etc/init.d/xdm to > launch kdm for me if you read /etc/init.d/xdm you'll see that it > finds the correct binary for kdm and then have init launch it in > other words, you're really not suppose to use rc.conf to setup > chooser.sh ;) rc.conf is used to setup /etc/init.d/xdm  Have another look; I don't think that's right.  chooser.sh actually sources rc.conf, looking for XSESSION.  There's definitely a direct connection.  /etc/init.d/xdm, on the other hand, makes no mention of XSESSION.  I believe you're thinking of DISPLAYMANAGER, a different variable defined in rc.conf, which does pertain to xdm/kdm.  XSESSION is not xdm/kdm specific.  Here's what rc.conf says:  # XSESSION is a new variable to control what window manager to start # default with X if run with xdm, startx or xinit.  The default # behavior is to look in /etc/X11/Sessions/ and run the script in # matching the value that XSESSION is set to.  This "default behavior" is what's broken.  Specifically, this:  # KDE - will start startkde  is wrong.  It fails, and you end up with twm (the fallback scenario from /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc).   David Black   ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-08-06 09:10:09 UTC  ``` This is correct. I'll change the rc.conf comment. It should be in the next  base-layout.  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-08-31 14:18:58 UTC  ``` OK, this exists in the latest baselayout packages.  ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=129337#c0)  Josh Bressers    2004-08-06 16:55:30 UTC  ``` Release of new Upstream-Version 2.64  Summary of major changes since 2.63 - -----------------------------------   - Security fix prevents a denial of service attack open to certain     malformed messages; this DoS affects all SpamAssassin 2.5x     and 2.6x versions to date.   - Backported several very reliable rules from the SpamAssassin 3.0.0     codebase.  FC[12] are handled by [bug 129284](show_bug.cgi?id=129284 "CLOSED ERRATA - CAN-2004-0796 DOS attack open to certain malformed messages")  RHEL2.1 does not contain spamassassin, therefore is not affected.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=129337#c1)  Josh Bressers    2004-08-19 21:56:25 UTC  ``` OK, I have found the upstream fix for this DOS.  Here's the output of my demo file  Fixed cat 999  0.00s user 0.01s system 1% cpu 0.766 total spamassassin  8.48s user 0.60s system 37% cpu 24.460 total  Not Fixed cat 999  0.00s user 0.02s system 2% cpu 0.939 total spamassassin  150.75s user 1.37s system 95% cpu 2:38.95 total  I'll attach the patch against the 3.0E src.rpm along with the demo file.    ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=129337#c2)  Josh Bressers    2004-08-19 22:00:10 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 102901](attachment.cgi?id=102901&action=diff "RHEL3 spamassassin patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=102901&action=edit "RHEL3 spamassassin patch") RHEL3 spamassassin patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=129337#c3)  Josh Bressers    2004-08-19 22:03:29 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 102902](attachment.cgi?id=102902 "Compressed POC message") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=102902&action=edit "Compressed POC message") Compressed POC message  This message is 5 megs when uncompressed, so I opted to gzip it for sanity's sake.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=129337#c4)  Josh Bressers    2004-08-25 13:40:00 UTC  ``` This is going to be RHSA-2004:451   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=129337#c6)  Josh Bressers    2004-09-30 14:23:50 UTC  ```  An errata has been issued which should help the problem  described in this bug report. This report is therefore being  closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files,  please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report  if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2004-451.html>    ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=129337#c7)  Pekka Savola    2004-12-19 18:06:20 UTC  ``` It seems the patch may be incomplete.  It seems to be missing a change to lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm - tokenize_headers() was also patched in 2.64 (vs the diff to 2.63).  I fear here may lurk a slightly different attack vector, but I have not analyzed this in detail.  See [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=129337#c2) at <https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=2268> for more.   ``` |  |
