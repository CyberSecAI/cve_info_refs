(0.10.3 - 0.10.4)  This is an integer overflow flaw.  It's most likely just a DOS, I see no evidence that it could run arbitrary code, but I'm not going to rule it out.   # SMB SID snooping could crash if there was no policy name for a handle. (0.9.15 - 0.10.4)  This is a null pointer flaw.  It's a DOS.   # The SNMP dissector could crash due to a malformed or missing community string. (0.8.15 - 0.10.4)  This is an out of bounds memory read issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=127381#c4)  Josh Bressers    2004-07-07 14:28:17 UTC  ``` This issue also affects RHEL2.1   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=127381#c5)  Marc Deslauriers    2004-07-09 01:22:02 UTC  ``` A backported patch for Ethereal 0.10.3 can be found here: <https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1840>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=127381#c6)  Mark J.

# Ethereal: Multiple security problems — GLSA **200407-08**

Multiple vulnerabilities including one buffer overflow exist in Ethereal,
which may allow an attacker to run arbitrary code or crash the program.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/ethereal** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.10.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.10.5** |

### Background

Ethereal is a feature rich network protocol analyzer.

### Description

There are multiple vulnerabilities in versions of Ethereal earlier than
0.10.5, including:

* In some cases the iSNS dissector could cause Ethereal to
  abort.
* If there was no policy name for a handle for SMB SID snooping it
  could cause a crash.
* A malformed or missing community string could cause the SNMP
  dissector to crash.

### Impact

An attacker could use these vulnerabilities to crash Ethereal or even
execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
Ethereal, which could be the root user.

### Workaround

For a temporary workaround you can disable all affected protocol
dissectors by selecting Analyze->Enabled Protocols... and deselecting
them from the list. For SMB you can disable SID snooping in the SMB
protocol preference. However, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to
the latest stable version.

### Resolution

All Ethereal users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.10.5"
 # emerge ">=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.10.5"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Ethereal fails to properly handle malformed iSNS packets

#### Vulnerability Note VU#829422

Original Release Date: 2004-09-07 | Last Revised: 2004-09-07

---

### Overview

[Ethereal](http://www.ethereal.com/) contains a vulnerability in the way it processes Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) packets.

### Description

| The Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) protocol is used to automate the discovery, management, and configuration of iSCSI and Fibre Channel devices in an IP network. Ethereal includes the ability to decode packets containing iSNS data. There is a vulnerability in the way the iSNS dissector decodes malformed iSNS packets. By sending a malformed iSNS packet or convincing a victim to read a malformed packet trace file, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could cause Ethereal to crash or potentially execute code of the attacker's choice. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker could cause Ethereal to crash or potentially execute code of the attacker's choice. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  Upgrade to version 0.10.5 or later.Note: Ethereal is considered BETA software at this time. |
| --- |

| **Disable iSNS protocol dissector**If you are unable to upgrade to version 0.10.5 or later, you can disable the iSNS protocol dissector by performing the following actions in Ethereal:1) Select Analyze->Enabled Protocols2) Disable the iSNS protocol dissector from the list by unchecking its "Status" checkboxHowever, it is strongly encouraged to upgrade to version 0.10.5 or later. |

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
