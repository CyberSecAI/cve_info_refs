# Apache 2, mod\_dav: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200409-21**

Several vulnerabilities have been found in Apache 2 and mod\_dav for Apache
1.3 which could allow a remote attacker to cause a Denial of Service or a
local user to get escalated privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.51** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.51**< **2.0** |

| Package | **net-www/mod\_dav** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.0.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.3-r2** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP server is one of most popular web servers on the internet.
mod\_ssl provides SSL v2/v3 and TLS v1 support for it and mod\_dav is the
Apache module for Distributed Authoring and Versioning (DAV).

### Description

A potential infinite loop has been found in the input filter of mod\_ssl
(CAN-2004-0748) as well as a possible segmentation fault in the
char\_buffer\_read function if reverse proxying to a SSL server is being used
(CAN-2004-0751). Furthermore, mod\_dav, as shipped in Apache httpd 2 or
mod\_dav 1.0.x for Apache 1.3, contains a NULL pointer dereference which can
be triggered remotely (CAN-2004-0809). The third issue is an input
validation error found in the IPv6 URI parsing routines within the apr-util
library (CAN-2004-0786). Additionally a possible buffer overflow has been
reported when expanding environment variables during the parsing of
configuration files (CAN-2004-0747).

### Impact

A remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service either by aborting a SSL
connection in a special way, resulting in CPU consumption, by exploiting
the segmentation fault in mod\_ssl or the mod\_dav flaw. A remote attacker
could also crash a httpd child process by sending a specially crafted URI.
The last vulnerabilty could be used by a local user to gain the privileges
of a httpd child, if the server parses a carefully prepared .htaccess file.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache 2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.51"
 # emerge ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.51"
```

All mod\_dav users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-www/mod_dav-1.0.3-r2"
 # emerge ">=net-www/mod_dav-1.0.3-r2"
```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=30134#c0)  M. "Alex" Hankins    2004-07-15 23:57:41 UTC  ``` Overview Description:  Intermittent segmentation faults occur in char_buffer_read at ssl_engine_io.c:348 when using a RewriteRule to do reverse proxying to an SSL origin server running IIS.      Steps to Reproduce:  1) Set up an IIS server using SSL and running eRoom 6.  2) Add the following directives to httpd.conf:  Listen 47290 SSLProxyEngine on RewriteEngine on RewriteRule /(.*) [https://some.eroom6.iis.server.com/$1](https://some.eroom6.iis.server.com/%241) [P]  3) Visit a URL similar to the following:  <http://reverse.proxy.com:47290/eRoomASP/CookieTest.asp?facility=facility&URL=%2FeRoom%2FFacility%2FRoom%2F0_4242>  If that doesn't cause the segfault, click around for a while.  (Yes, reverse proxying from non-SSL to SSL is not a good idea, but it keeps the example simpler.)      Actual Results:  Segmentation fault in error_log: [Thu Jul 15 19:38:36 2004] [notice] child pid 42 exit signal Segmentation fault (11), possible coredump in /usr/local/httpd-2.0.50      Build Date & Platform:  2004-07-14 build on SunOS 5.8 SUNW,UltraAX-i2      Additional Information:  Here is a stack trace from gdb:  #0  0xfef5060c in memcpy ()    from /usr/platform/SUNW,UltraAX-i2/lib/libc_psr.so.1 #1  0xfeafef54 in char_buffer_read (buffer=0x1649ac,     in=0x2000 <Address 0x2000 out of bounds>, inl=8192) at ssl_engine_io.c:348 #2  0xfeaff388 in ssl_io_input_read (inctx=0x164990,     buf=0x1649b8 "Content-Length: 121\r\nCort/Martonia/0_2615\r\nContent-Length: 121\r\nCent-Length: 121\r\nCmeport/Martonia/0_2615\r\nContent-Length: 121\r\nCmeport/Martonia/0_2615\r\nContent-Length: 121\r\nCrtonia/0_2615\r\nContent-Le"..., len=0xffbea8cc) at ssl_engine_io.c:561 #3  0xfeaff624 in ssl_io_input_getline (inctx=0x164990,     buf=0x1649b8 "Content-Length: 121\r\nCort/Martonia/0_2615\r\nContent-Length: 121\r\nCent-Length: 121\r\nCmeport/Martonia/0_2615\r\nContent-Length: 121\r\nCmeport/Martonia/0_2615\r\nContent-Length: 121\r\nCrtonia/0_2615\r\nContent-Le"..., len=0xffbea944) at ssl_engine_io.c:712 #4  0xfeb00118 in ssl_io_filter_input (f=0x1669c0, bb=0x158f98,     mode=4290685252, block=APR_BLOCK_READ, readbytes=0) at ssl_engine_io.c:1226 #5  0x42978 in ap_get_brigade (next=0x1669c0, bb=0x158f98,     mode=AP_MODE_GETLINE, block=APR_BLOCK_READ, readbytes=0)     at util_filter.c:474 #6  0x4aab4 in net_time_filter (f=0x158e20, b=0x158f98, mode=AP_MODE_GETLINE,     block=APR_BLOCK_READ, readbytes=0) at core.c:3600 #7  0x42978 in ap_get_brigade (next=0x158e20, bb=0x158f98,     mode=AP_MODE_GETLINE, block=APR_BLOCK_READ, readbytes=0)     at util_filter.c:474 #8  0x43e0c in ap_rgetline_core (s=0xffbeab94, n=8192, read=0xffbeab90,     r=0x1671b8, fold=1, bb=0x158f98) at protocol.c:214 #9  0x441a4 in ap_getline (s=0xffbeccd8 "Content-Length", n=8192, r=0x1671b8,     fold=1) at protocol.c:478 #10 0xfe8552d4 in ap_proxy_read_headers (r=0x1821d0, rr=0x1671b8,     buffer=0xffbeccd8 "Content-Length", size=8192, c=0x1671b8)     at proxy_util.c:457 #11 0xfe833014 in ap_proxy_http_process_response (p=0x157960, r=0x1821d0,     p_conn=0x157ee8, origin=0x158168, backend=0x157f00, conf=0xf0268,     bb=0x157e98, server_portstr=0xffbeed68 ":47290") at proxy_http.c:755 #12 0xfe833ba4 in ap_proxy_http_handler (r=0x1821d0, conf=0xf0268,     url=0x158038 "/eRoomASP/CookieTest.asp?facility=memeport&URL=%2FeRoom%2Fmemeport%2FMartonia%2F0_2615", proxyname=0x0, proxyport=60776) at proxy_http.c:1121 #13 0xfe85435c in proxy_run_scheme_handler (r=0x1821d0, conf=0xf0268,     url=0x1839ce "<https://eroomhost.aaa.bbb.com/eRoomASP/CookieTest.asp?facility=memeport&URL=%2FeRoom%2Fmemeport%2FMartonia%2F0_2615>", proxyhost=0x0,     proxyport=0) at mod_proxy.c:1113 #14 0xfe852ed8 in proxy_handler (r=0x1821d0) at mod_proxy.c:418 #15 0x359a8 in ap_run_handler (r=0x1821d0) at config.c:151 #16 0x35fa4 in ap_invoke_handler (r=0x1821d0) at config.c:358 #17 0x32c44 in ap_process_request (r=0x1821d0) at http_request.c:246 #18 0x2df14 in ap_process_http_connection (c=0x157a70) at http_core.c:250 #19 0x40090 in ap_run_process_connection (c=0x157a70) at connection.c:42 #20 0x403a4 in ap_process_connection (c=0x157a70, csd=0x157998)     at connection.c:175 #21 0x3422c in child_main (child_num_arg=5) at prefork.c:609 #22 0x343ac in make_child (s=0x8edb0, slot=5) at prefork.c:703 #23 0x345fc in perform_idle_server_maintenance (p=0x8c690) at prefork.c:838 #24 0x34a34 in ap_mpm_run (_pconf=0x0, plog=0x63400, s=0x83000)     at prefork.c:1039 #25 0x3ad44 in main (argc=3, argv=0xffbef4ac) at main.c:617 ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=30134#c1)  Nick Kew    2004-07-16 05:12:34 UTC  ``` Does this still happen if you take mod_rewrite out of the setup and use ProxyPass instead? ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=30134#c2)  M. "Alex" Hankins    2004-07-20 18:11:48 UTC  ``` Yes, I still get what seems to be the same segfault (according to gdb) if I replace these config lines:  RewriteEngine on RewriteRule /(.*) [https://some.eroom6.iis.server.com/$1](https://some.eroom6.iis.server.com/%241) [P]  with this one:  ProxyPass / <https://some.eroom6.iis.server.com/> ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=30134#c3)  Joe Orton    2004-08-11 13:30:29 UTC  ``` This backtrace is a little strange:  #1  0xfeafef54 in char_buffer_read (buffer=0x1649ac,     in=0x2000 <Address 0x2000 out of bounds>, inl=8192) at ssl_engine_io.c:348  which means either stack corruption by memcpy or in got passed in as a pointer to address 8192 somehow.  Can you, from gdb against a core dump, check:  up 2 (into ssl_io_input_read) print *inctx info locals print buf print len    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=30134#c4)  Stephan Tesch    2004-08-16 11:54:28 UTC  ``` Hi Joe,    I do suffer from the same bug. Attached is the info you requested. If you need  additional testing, please say so. I cleared some info from the contents of  buffer to not disclose critical information.

It looks like the cause is: ssl_io_input_read is called with inctx->mode == SPECULATIVE (this only normally happens in the proxy IIRC); ssl_io_input_read calls char_buffer_read, which executes the case where it does:          buffer->value = NULL;         buffer->length = 0;  and ssl_io_input_read then screws up the inctx->cbuf for good.              /* We want to rollback this read. */             inctx->cbuf.value -= bytes;             inctx->cbuf.length += bytes;  cbuf = { length = 1, value = 0xffffffff <Address 0xffffffff out of bounds>},   per your backtrace.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=30134#c6)  Joe Orton    2004-08-17 12:48:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 12459](attachment.cgi?id=12459&action=diff "proposed fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=12459&action=edit "proposed fix") proposed fix ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=30134#c7)  Joe Orton    2004-08-17 12:49:35 UTC  ``` The patch attached above should fix the segfaults, I'm not yet sure if this is the cleanest or most correct fix. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=30134#c8)  Joe Orton    2004-08-17 21:03:21 UTC  ``` The fix checked in should be equivalent:  <http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/modules/ssl/ssl_engine_io.c?r1=1.125&r2=1.126>  This issue has possible security implications; it's been assigned CVE CAN-2004-0751 (cve.mitre.org).
