{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `char_buffer_read` function within `ssl_engine_io.c`. When `ssl_io_input_read` is called with `inctx->mode` set to `SPECULATIVE` (which can occur during reverse proxying), `char_buffer_read` can execute a code path that sets `buffer->value = NULL` and `buffer->length = 0`. Subsequently, `ssl_io_input_read` attempts to manipulate `inctx->cbuf` based on the now-invalidated buffer, leading to incorrect memory access and a segmentation fault.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of speculative read mode during SSL reverse proxying.",
      "Improper manipulation of buffer structures when a speculative read is rolled back.",
      "Use of invalid buffer pointer after rollback operation.",
      "Potential stack corruption."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering a segmentation fault in the Apache httpd child process when reverse proxying to an SSL server.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when Apache acts as a reverse proxy for a backend SSL server. Specifically, the issue occurs within the input filter of mod_ssl when handling a connection where a speculative read is performed.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send requests to the vulnerable Apache server configured as a reverse proxy in a way that triggers the speculative read code path in mod_ssl."
