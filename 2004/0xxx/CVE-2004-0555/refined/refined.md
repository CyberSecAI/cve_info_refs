- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Buffer overflows in the queue package.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflows.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The advisory states the problem type is "remote" implying a remote attacker can cause the overflow and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The advisory does not detail specific attack vectors, but it implies network-based attacks due to the remote nature of the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A remote attacker would need to send specially crafted data to the queue service to trigger the buffer overflows.
