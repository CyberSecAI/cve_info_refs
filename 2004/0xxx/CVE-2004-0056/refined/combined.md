## Multiple vulnerabilities in H.323 implementations

#### Vulnerability Note VU#749342

Original Release Date: 2004-01-13 | Last Revised: 2009-07-29

---

### Overview

A number of vulnerabilities have been discovered in various implementations of the multimedia telephony protocols H.323 and H.225. Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and video conferencing equpiment and software can use these protocols to interoperate over a variety of computer networks. The majority of the vulnerabilities discovered are limited to denial of service impacts; however, several may allow unauthorized code execution.

### Description

| The U.K. National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Center (NISCC) has reported multiple vulnerabilities in different vendor implementations of the multimedia telephony protocols H.323 and H.225. H.323 and H.225 are international standard protocols, published by the International Telecommunications Union, used to facilitate communication among telephony and multimedia systems. An example of such a system includes VoIP or video-conferencing equipment and software deployed on a network or computer. Sending an exceptional ASN.1 element to a vulnerable telephony component that cannot handle it may cause the application or system behavior to become unpredictable.  A test suite developed by NISCC has exposed vulnerabilities in a variety of H.323/H.225 implementations. While most of these vulnerabilities exist in ASN.1 parsing routines, some vulnerabilities may occur elsewhere. Due to the general lack of specific vulnerability information, this document covers multiple vulnerabilities in different H.323/H.225 implementations. Information about individual vendors is available in the [Systems Affected](#systems) section.The U.K. National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre is tracking this vulnerability as [NISCC/006489/H.323](http://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2004/006489/h323.htm). |
| --- |

### Impact

| The impacts associated with these vulnerabilities include denial of service, and potential execution of arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Patch or Upgrade**Apply a patch or upgrade as appropriate. Information about specific vendors is available in the Systems Affected section of this document. |
| --- |

| One potential workaround includes making sure ports 1720/tcp and 1720/udp are blocked on network perimeters. |

HPSBGN01004 REVISION: 0

SSRT3614 - HP OpenCall Multiservice Controller (OCMC) DoS
 (Denial of Service)

- --------------------------------------------------------------
NOTICE: There are no restrictions for distribution of this
 Bulletin provided that it remains complete and intact.

 The information in this Security bulletin should be
 acted upon as soon as possible.

INITIAL RELEASE: 25 March 2004

POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT: Remote Denial of Service (DoS)

SOURCE: HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY
 HP Software Security Response Team

REFERENCES: CERT CA-2004-01, CISCO Advisory 47843

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:

A potential security vulnerability has been identified in the
HP OpenCall MultiService Controller (OCMC) H.323 stack that may
allow a remote user to create a Denial of Service (DoS).

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS\*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.

All versions HP OCMC v1.2 and HP OCMC v1.1 for HP-UX 11.0

BACKGROUND:
The HP Software Security Response team has contacted
the source and various other vendors and is not aware
of any malicious exploitation of any of the vulnerabilities
described in this bulletin.

A test suite developed by the U.K. National Infrastructure
Security Co-ordination Centre (NISCC) and the University of
Oulu Security Programming Group (OUSPG) has exposed
vulnerabilities in several implementations of the H.323
protocol.

The potential vulnerabilities may be exploited to produce a
denial of service (DoS) attack. Such an attack may cause an
affected product to failover or crash and failover. Due to
its robust design OCMC will recover from most attack scenarios.
In the event that OCMC does not recover, the attack can be
stopped by blocking the offending IP address. Attacks may also
be blocked by creating an access list to restrict TCP port 1720
traffic to known, trusted IP addresses.

RESOLUTION:

HP will be providing patches to the impacted versions of OCMC:

 OCMC v1.2 released January 2004
 OCMC v1.1 patch 46
 OCMC v1.1 patch 37

This bulletin will be revised as the patches become available
and patches will be available from the normal HP Services
support channel.

Please write to security-alert@hp.com to request a PGP signed
version of this bulletin.

Mitel Networks Security Advisory MNSA-2004-001: Vulnerability Reports in
H.323 Implementations

   Synopsis:    Interim Statement About Vulnerability Reports in H.323
                Implementations

   Advisory:           MNSA-2004-001

   Release Date:       2004-01-16
   Last Revised:       2004-01-16

   Severity:           Important

   Impact:             See below

   Affected Products:  See below

1. SUMMARY

   On Tuesday, January 13th, advisories were issued by the
   UK National Infrastructure Security Co-Ordination Centre and
   the CERT Coordination Center about potential vulnerabilities
   in multiple implementations of the H.323 protocol used for
   some Voice-over-IP and videoconferencing products.  Exploitation
   of these vulnerabilities could potentially result in a denial-of-
   service attack or remote code execution.

   At the current time Mitel Networks has determined that all of
   its VoIP products are NOT vulnerable as they do not make use
   of the H.323 protocol.

   However, we are still investigating whether or not a potential
   vulnerability exists with the following videoconferencing products:

     \* 5700 Voice First Solution
     \* 5750 Desktop Video Appliance
     \* 5760 Videoconference Appliance

   This advisory will be updated when the results of that investigation
   are complete.

2. RECOMMENDATION

   Until the investigation can be completed Mitel Networks recommends
   that administrators of sites with the 5700 Voice First Solution
   follow the workaround suggested in the CERT advisory of applying
   network filters to block access to H.323 services at network borders
   to minimize any potential denial-of-service attacks originating
   outside your network.  Please see the CERT advisory (URL below) for
   more information.

3. DESCRIPTION

   No vulnerability has yet been identified.  If a vulnerability is
   found, the description will appear here.

4. AFFECTED PRODUCTS

   As noted above, the only Mitel Networks products still under
   investigation are:

     \* 5700 Voice First Solution
     \* 5750 Desktop Video Appliance
     \* 5760 Videoconference Appliance

   It is important to note that no vulnerability has yet been found
   in these products and they are still under active investigation.

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
