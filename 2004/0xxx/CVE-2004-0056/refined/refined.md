    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2004-0056",
      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in various implementations of H.323 and H.225 multimedia telephony protocols. These vulnerabilities primarily lead to denial of service, but some may allow unauthorized code execution.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerabilities stem from improper handling of exceptional ASN.1 elements, particularly within the parsing routines of H.323/H.225 implementations. Some vulnerabilities may exist outside of ASN.1 parsing as well.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of exceptional ASN.1 elements.",
        "Vulnerabilities in ASN.1 parsing routines.",
        "Other unspecified vulnerabilities outside ASN.1 parsing."
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service (DoS), potential for arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": "Sending malformed ASN.1 elements to vulnerable H.323/H.225 implementations.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to craft and send malformed ASN.1 elements over the network. No specific privileged access or user interaction is mentioned."
