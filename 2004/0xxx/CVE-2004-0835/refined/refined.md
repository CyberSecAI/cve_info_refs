Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-0835:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect privilege check in the `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME` operation within MySQL. Instead of checking the `CREATE/INSERT` rights on the new (target) table name, it incorrectly checks the rights of the old (source) table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Privilege Check:** The primary weakness lies in the flawed logic for permission verification during table renaming. This allows users to perform actions they aren't authorized for, potentially escalating privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting this flaw, users could potentially rename tables to which they do not have `CREATE/INSERT` privileges, leading to unauthorized actions on those tables. This allows bypassing intended access controls.
- **Data Manipulation:** Although not explicitly stated, it could also lead to unauthorized modification or deletion of data by renaming tables and then using the new name for the malicious operations if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered by executing an `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME` SQL command with a user that has the required privileges on source table but not on target table.
- **Local/Remote Access:** Exploitation could originate from either a local user with valid database access, or a remote attacker who has somehow gained access to the database with a valid username and password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid Database User:** The attacker needs a valid MySQL username and password.
- **`ALTER` Privilege on Source Table:** They must have the `ALTER` privilege on the table they intend to rename.
- **No `CREATE/INSERT` Privileges on Target Table:** The attacker must NOT have `CREATE/INSERT` privileges on the table name they intend to rename the source table to.
- **SQL Execution Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute SQL queries against the MySQL server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided bug report ([https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=3270](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=3270)) details the fix implemented, indicating that the code was changed to use the right table for grants checking.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200410-22) confirms the vulnerability and its impact, explicitly stating that the privilege checking issue could be used to bypass rights on databases.
- This vulnerability is part of a set of vulnerabilities fixed in MySQL version 4.0.21.

In summary, this CVE identifies a privilege escalation vulnerability due to an incorrect table rights check during the `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME` operation, which could allow unauthorized users to manipulate table names and gain access.
