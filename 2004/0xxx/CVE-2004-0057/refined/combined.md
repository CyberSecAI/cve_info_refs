Hello,

beside the l2tp vulnerability mentioned on this list this month, I found
two other locations in the code
which an attacker could use to crash, or in the worst case exploit,
tcpdump.

The first critical piece of code is found in print-isakmp.c:332. The
function rawprint() does not
check its arguments thus it's easy for an attacker to pass a big 'len'
or a bogus 'loc' leading to a
segmentation fault in the for loop.
rawprint() gets called at various places in print-isakmp.c.

The second bug is located in print-radius.c:471. The for loop of
print_attr_string() is written in an
unsafe manner. 'length' and 'data' should be checked.
print_attr_string() is called via a function pointer from
radius_attr_print() line 784 where no upper bound
for 'rad_attr->len' is defined. This leads to a segmentation fault aswell.

Both vulnerbilities were tested against tcpdump 3.8.1, libpcap 0.7.1 and
linux.

Thanks,
Jonathan Heusser

  EnGarde Secure Linux is an enterprise class Linux platform engineered
  to enable corporations to quickly and cost-effectively build a complete
  and secure Internet presence while preventing Internet threats.

OVERVIEW
- --------
  Several buffer overflows were recently discovered in tcpdump, a program
  used for inspecting network traffic.  By sending specially constructed
  packets across the wire a malicious remote attacker could cause tcpdump
  to crash or potentially run arbitrary code as the user under which
  tcpdump was being run.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the following names to these issues:

    CAN-2004-0057 -- The rawprint function in the ISAKMP decoding
      routines (print-isakmp.c) for tcpdump 3.8.1 and earlier allows
      remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault)
      via malformed ISAKMP packets that cause invalid "len" or "loc"
      values to be used in a loop, a different vulnerability than
      CAN-2003-0989.

    CAN-2003-0989 -- tcpdump before 3.8.1 allows remote attackers to
      cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via certain ISAKMP
      packets, a different vulnerability than CAN-2004-0057.

    CAN-2003-1029 -- The L2TP protocol parser in tcpdump 3.8.1 and earlier
      allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop
      and memory consumption) via a packet with invalid data to UDP port
      1701, which causes l2tp_avp_print to use a bad length value when
      calling print_octets.

  Guardian Digital products affected by this issue include:

    EnGarde Secure Community v1.0.1
    EnGarde Secure Community 2
    EnGarde Secure Professional v1.1
    EnGarde Secure Professional v1.2
    EnGarde Secure Professional v1.5

  It is recommended that all users apply this update as soon as possible.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated tcpdump resolves security vulnerability
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1222
Issue date:        2004-01-31
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Security
Cross references:  <https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1222>
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0989, CAN-2004-0055, CAN-2004-0057
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated tcpdump packages are now available that fix multiple security
vulnerabilities which may allow remote attackers to exploit these issues
by sending carefully-crafted packets to a victim. If the victim uses
tcpdump, these packets could result in a denial of service, or possibly
execute arbitrary code as the 'pcap' user.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386

3. Problem description:

Tcpdump is a command-line tool for monitoring network traffic. Tcpdump can
capture and display the packet headers on a particular network interface
or on all interfaces. Tcpdump can display all of the packet headers, or
just the ones that match particular criteria.

George Bakos discovered flaws in the ISAKMP decoding routines of tcpdump
versions prior to 3.8.1. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0989 to this issue.

Jonathan Heusser discovered an additional flaw in the ISAKMP decoding
routines for tcpdump 3.8.1 and earlier. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0057 to
this issue.

Jonathan Heusser discovered a flaw in the print_attr_string function in the
RADIUS decoding routines for tcpdump 3.8.1 and earlier. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0055 to this issue.

Users of tcpdump should update to these update packages, which contain a
backported security patch that corrects this issue.

Fedora Legacy would like to thank George Bakos and Jonathan Heusser for
discovering and disclosing these issues, as well as Christian Pearce for
providing a backported fix for Red Hat Linux 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit
<http://www.fedoralegacy.org/download> for directions on how to configure
yum and apt-get.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
