Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2004-0947:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Buffer Overflow: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking within the `unarj` program when handling long file names embedded within ARJ archives.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow (CAN-2004-0947):** A buffer overflow occurs when `unarj` processes excessively long file names included in an archive. This overflow can lead to a crash or potentially allow arbitrary code execution.
- **Path Traversal (CAN-2004-1027):** The `unarj` program also suffers from a path traversal vulnerability, which occurs because the program does not adequately sanitize the pathnames within the archive. This flaw allows an attacker to create an archive that, when extracted, writes files into the parent directory or even overwrites crucial files/programs if the extraction is recursive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** Exploitation of the buffer overflow can cause the `unarj` application to crash.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `unarj`.
- **File Overwrite:** The path traversal vulnerability enables an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the file system, including critical system files.
- **System Compromise:** By overwriting system files or executing arbitrary code, an attacker could gain control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Archive:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted ARJ archive file containing malicious file names or paths.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user extracts the malicious archive using the vulnerable `unarj` program.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Archive Creation:** The attacker needs the capability to create ARJ archive files that contain the long filename buffer overflow or malicious path names.
- **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs to trick a user into extracting the crafted archive using the vulnerable program to be exploited.
