# Fedora-Legacy alert FLSA:2272 (unarj)

```

| From: |  | Marc Deslauriers <marcdeslauriers@videotron.ca> |
| --- | --- | --- |
| To: |  | bugtraq@securityfocus.com, full-disclosure@lists.netsys.com |
| Subject: |  | [FLSA-2005:2272] Updated unarj package fixes security issue |
| Date: |  | Tue, 01 Feb 2005 20:16:20 -0500 |

---------------------------------------------------------------------
                Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated unarj package fixes security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:2272
Issue date:        2005-02-01
Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
Cross references:  <https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=2272>
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0947 CAN-2004-1027
---------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated unarj package that fixes a buffer overflow vulnerability and
a directory traversal vulnerability is now available.

The unarj program is an archiving utility which can extract
ARJ-compatible archives.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

A buffer overflow bug was discovered in unarj when handling long file
names contained in an archive. An attacker could create a specially
crafted archive which could cause unarj to crash or possibly execute
arbitrary code when extracted by a victim. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0947 to this issue.

Additionally, a path traversal vulnerability was discovered in unarj. An
attacker could create a specially crafted archive which would create
files in the parent ("..") directory when extracted by a victim. When
used recursively, this vulnerability could be used to overwrite critical
system files and programs. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1027 to this
issue.

Users of unarj should upgrade to this updated package which contains
backported patches and is not vulnerable to these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit <http://www> fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

Package        : unarj
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0947 CAN-2004-1027
Debian Bug     : 281922

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in unarj, a non-free ARJ
unarchive utility.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CAN-2004-0947

    A buffer overflow has been discovered when handling long file
    names contained in an archive.  An attacker could create a
    specially crafted archive which could cause unarj to crash or
    possibly execute arbitrary code when being extracted by a victim.

CAN-2004-1027

    A directory traversal vulnerability has been found so that an
    attacker could create a specially crafted archive which would
    create files in the parent directory when being extracted by a
    victim.  When used recursively, this vulnerability could be used
    to overwrite critical system files and programs.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.43-3woody1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems don't apply since
unstable/non-free does not contain the unarj package.

We recommend that you upgrade your unarj package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# unarj: Long filenames buffer overflow and a path traversal vulnerability — GLSA **200411-29**

unarj contains a buffer overflow and a directory traversal vulnerability.
This could lead to overwriting of arbitrary files or the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/unarj** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.63a-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.63a-r2** |

### Background

unarj is an ARJ archive decompressor.

### Description

unarj has a bounds checking vulnerability within the handling of
long filenames in archives. It also fails to properly sanitize paths
when extracting an archive (if the "x" option is used to preserve
paths).

### Impact

An attacker could trigger a buffer overflow or a path traversal by
enticing a user to open an archive containing specially-crafted path
names, potentially resulting in the overwrite of files or execution of
arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running unarj.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All unarj users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/unarj-2.63a-r2"
```
