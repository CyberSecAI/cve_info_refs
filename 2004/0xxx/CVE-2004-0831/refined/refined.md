- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because McAfee VirusScan does not drop SYSTEM privileges when accessing the "System Scan" properties from the System Tray applet.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper privilege management. Specifically, the application retains SYSTEM privileges when launching a file browser dialog.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local users can escalate their privileges to SYSTEM, gaining complete control over the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local. It involves right-clicking the System Tray icon, choosing "Properties", selecting "System Scan", and then, from the "Report" tab, selecting "Browse...". Navigating to C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\, right-clicking cmd.exe, and selecting "Open" spawns a command shell with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have a local user account on the affected system.
