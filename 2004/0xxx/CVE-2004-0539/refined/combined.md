## Mac OS X Safari "Show in Finder" option may allow arbitrary file execution

#### Vulnerability Note VU#773190

Original Release Date: 2004-08-24 | Last Revised: 2004-09-07

---

### Overview

Mac OS X Safari "Show in Finder" option may automatically open and execute downloaded files. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| Safari is the default web browser for Mac OS X. Safari has a "Show in Finder" option to allow users to automatically reveal the location of downloaded files in a Finder (the default OS X file browser) window. This feature is flawed as Finder may attempt to automatically open and execute certain types of files when the location is revealed. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code since certain files may automatically open without verification of their contents. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apple has released a security update labeled APPLE-SA-2004-06-07 to address this issue. Information regarding the update can be found at <http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=25785>. |
