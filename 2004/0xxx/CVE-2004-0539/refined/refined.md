Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-0539:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the interaction between Safari's "Show in Finder" feature and the Mac OS X Finder. When the "Show in Finder" option is used to reveal the location of a downloaded file, the Finder might automatically attempt to open and execute certain file types without user verification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of user verification: The system does not verify the contents of certain downloaded files before potentially executing them.
- Automatic execution: The Finder automatically attempts to open certain file types, leading to potential code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious file downloads: An attacker can host a malicious file on a website.
- Social engineering: An attacker could trick the user into downloading the file.
- "Show in Finder" feature: The vulnerability is triggered when the user utilizes Safari's "Show in Finder" option on a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host files on a web server or otherwise deliver them to the user.
- The attacker would need to rely on the user to download the file and use the "Show in Finder" option in Safari.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue is specific to Mac OS X and Safari.
- Apple addressed this issue with a security update (APPLE-SA-2004-06-07).
- The vulnerability was publicly reported by Apple Product Security.
