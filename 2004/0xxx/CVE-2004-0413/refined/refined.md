- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `svnserve` protocol parser trusts the length of a URI string sent by a client without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Integer overflow**: A client can send a very long string, causing an integer overflow in the variable holding the string length, leading to the server allocating less memory than required.
    - **Heap overflow**: The insufficient memory allocation can then lead to a heap overflow when the server writes the overly long string into the undersized buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The server may allocate excessive memory for an extremely long URI string causing a DoS.
    - **Arbitrary code execution**: A crafted string can cause a heap overflow that may be exploitable for remote code execution with the privileges of the `svnserve` process.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted URI strings to the `svnserve` process using the `svn://`, `svn+ssh://`, or other tunneled `svn+\*://` protocols.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need read or write access to the Subversion repository. Even unauthenticated users can send the malicious svn protocol requests.
