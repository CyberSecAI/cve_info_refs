Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that the BEA WebLogic Server configuration wizard (config.sh on UNIX and config.cmd on Windows) stores the administrative username and password in clear text within the log files it generates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Clear Text Storage of Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of sensitive administrative credentials in an easily readable format within log files.
-   **Insecure Logging Practices:** The configuration wizard's logging mechanism is flawed by not obfuscating or encrypting sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who gains access to the log files can obtain the administrative username and password.
-   **System Compromise:** With administrative access, the attacker can fully compromise the WebLogic Server and potentially any applications it hosts.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Log File Access:** The primary attack vector involves gaining access to the log files generated by the WebLogic Server configuration wizard. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    -   Compromising the server's file system.
    -   Gaining access to a system with access to shared logging infrastructure.
    -   Exploiting other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **File System Access:** The attacker must be able to read the log files produced by the configuration wizard. This requires some level of access to the system or its logging infrastructure.
-   **No Prior Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require prior authentication to the WebLogic Server to exploit the vulnerability, only access to the log files.

**Additional Details:**

-   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects BEA WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express 8.1, released through Service Pack 2, on all platforms.
-   **Vendor Advisory:** BEA Systems acknowledged the vulnerability in their advisory BEA04-58.00.
-   **Solution:** The vendor released a patch (CR135189_81sp2patch.jar) for WebLogic Server 8.1 Service Pack 2 and included the fix in Service Pack 3.
