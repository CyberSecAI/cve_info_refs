  "response": {
    "root_cause": "An unsafe usage of `sscanf()` within the `ne_rfc1036_parse()` function in the neon library.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation in date parsing."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution with the privileges of the user running the affected application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious WebDAV server sending a specially crafted date string to the vulnerable application.",
      "Exploitation depends on the application linked against neon, but out-of-memory conditions can be leveraged due to overflowed data being placed before the out-of-memory callback function pointer."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to set up a malicious WebDAV server and have a vulnerable application connect to it.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered by passing a specially crafted date string to the `ne_rfc1036_parse()` function which results in a `sscanf()` string overflow into static heap variables. OpenOffice and Subversion are specifically mentioned as not using the vulnerable function and therefore, not susceptible to this particular vulnerability. The advisory also notes that an application could be vulnerable even if it doesn't directly call `ne_rfc1036_parse()` because higher-level API functions might use it. The vulnerability could be exploited remotely, and successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution."
