How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# cadaver heap-based buffer overflow — GLSA **200405-15**

There is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the neon library
used in cadaver, possibly leading to execution of arbitrary code when
connected to a malicious server.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/cadaver** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.22.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.22.2** |

### Background

cadaver is a command-line WebDAV client.

### Description

Stefan Esser discovered a vulnerability in the code of the neon library
(see GLSA 200405-13). This library is also included in cadaver.

### Impact

When connected to a malicious WebDAV server, this vulnerability could allow
remote execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the user running
cadaver.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are advised to upgrade
to the latest available version of cadaver.

### Resolution

All users of cadaver should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-misc/cadaver-0.22.2"
 # emerge ">=net-misc/cadaver-0.22.2"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

     Advisory: libneon date parsing vulnerability
 Release Date: 2004/05/19
Last Modified: 2004/05/19
       Author: Stefan Esser [s.esser@e-matters.de]

  Application: libneon <= 0.24.5
     Severity: A vulnerability within a date parsing function
               allows arbitrary code execution
         Risk: Medium
Vendor Status: Vendor is releasing a bugfixed version.
    Reference: <http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/062004.html>

Overview:

   Quote from: <http://www.webdav.org/neon>

   "neon is an HTTP and WebDAV client library, with a C interface. Featuring:

    * High-level interface to HTTP and WebDAV methods (PUT, GET, HEAD etc)
    * Low-level interface to HTTP request handling, to allow implementing...
    * persistent connections
    * RFC2617 basic and digest authentication (including auth-int, md5-sess)
    * Proxy support (including basic/digest authentication)
    * SSL/TLS support using OpenSSL (including client certificate support)
    * Generic WebDAV 207 XML response handling mechanism
    * XML parsing using the expat or libxml parsers
    * Easy generation of error messages from 207 error responses
    * WebDAV resource manipulation: MOVE, COPY, DELETE, MKCOL.
    * WebDAV metadata support: set and remove properties, query any set...
    * autoconf macros supplied for easily embedding neon directly inside..."

   A vulnerability within a libneon date parsing function could cause a
   heap overflow which could lead to remote code execution, depending on
   the application using libneon.

   OpenOffice and Subversion *DO NOT* use this function and are therefore
   not vulnerable to THIS problem.

Details:

   While scanning the libneon source code for common programming errors
   an unsafe usage of sscanf() was discovered within one of the date
   parsing functions.

   When a special crafted date string is passed to the ne_rfc1036_parse()
   it may trigger a sscanf() string overflow into static heap variables.
   Exploitability heavily depends on the application linked against neon
   but is considered trivial in cases where an out-of-memory condition
   can be triggered, because the overflowing variable is placed infront
   of the libneon out-of-memory callback function pointer.

   Please notice that your application could be vulnerable even if you
   do not use ne_rfc1036_parse() directly, because its functionality
   is used by several higher level API functions.

Proof of Concept:

   e-matters is not going to release an exploit for this vulnerability to
   the public.

Disclosure Timeline:

   02. May 2004 - Neon developers were contacted by email
   04. May 2004 - Joe Orton has fixed the bug within neon and waits
                  for the public disclosure date
   19. May 2004 - Coordinated Public Disclosure

CVE Information:

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
   assigned the name CAN-2004-0398 to this issue.

Recommendation:

   Because Subversion and OpenOffice, which are the most important libneon
   users, are not using the vulnerable function the issue is rated with a
   medium severity. Nevertheless upgrading your neon version is recommended
   because other applications could be vulnerable and could expose the
   vulnerable function to the outside world.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# neon heap-based buffer overflow — GLSA **200405-13**

A vulnerability potentially allowing remote execution of arbitrary code has
been discovered in the neon library.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/neon** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.24.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.24.6** |

### Background

neon provides an HTTP and WebDAV client library.

### Description

Stefan Esser discovered a vulnerability in the code of the neon library :
if a malicious date string is passed to the ne\_rfc1036\_parse() function, it
can trigger a string overflow into static heap variables.

### Impact

Depending on the application linked against libneon and when connected to a
malicious WebDAV server, this vulnerability could allow execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running that application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are advised to upgrade
to the latest available version of neon.

### Resolution

All users of neon should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-misc/neon-0.24.6"
 # emerge ">=net-misc/neon-0.24.6"
```

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Stefan Esser discovered [[1]](#1) a vulnerability within a date parsing
  function in the Neon HTTP and WebDAV client library [[0]](#0). If a special
  crafted date string is passed to the ne_rfc1036_parse() function it
  may trigger a sscanf() string overflow into static heap variables.
  Exploitability heavily depends on the application linked against
  Neon, but is considered trivial in cases where an out-of-memory
  condition can be triggered, because the overflowing variable is placed
  in front of the Neon out-of-memory callback function pointer. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2004-0398 [[2]](#2) to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
  -q neon" (respectively for "subversion", "cadaver", "sitecopy" and
  "tla"). If you have one of the packages installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution) [3][[4]](#4).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6][7][8][[9]](#9), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [11][[12]](#12) or
  a mirror location, verify its integrity [[13]](#13), build a corresponding
  binary RPM from it [[3]](#3) and update your OpenPKG installation by
  applying the binary RPM [[4]](#4). For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.0,
  perform the following operations to permanently fix the security
  problem (for other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.0/UPD
  ftp> get neon-0.24.4-2.0.2.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig neon-0.24.4-2.0.2.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild neon-0.24.4-2.0.2.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/neon-0.24.4-2.0.2.*.rpm

  Additionally, perform similar steps for the "subversion", "cadaver",
  "sitecopy" and "tla" packages.
