- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of user-supplied input within the `[img]` tag when creating HTML output in Discuz! Board. Specifically, the forum software does not sanitize the input properly when generating the `<img>` tag, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to a lack of input sanitization when processing the `[img]` tag.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes when a user views a thread containing the specially crafted `[img]` tag. This allows the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim user, such as stealing cookies, redirecting them to malicious websites, or defacing the forum.
- **Attack vectors:**
    -  An attacker inserts a malicious `[img]` tag into a forum post or message.
    -  When a user views the post or message, the malicious JavaScript code embedded within the generated HTML `<img>` tag executes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to post or message content to the forum.
    - The attacker needs to be aware of the forum's rendering behavior for the `[img]` tag.
