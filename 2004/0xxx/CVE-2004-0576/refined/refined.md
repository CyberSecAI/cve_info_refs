The content is related to CVE-2004-0576.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way GNU Radius handles SNMP messages. Specifically, the code does not properly validate the Object Identifier (OID) within an SNMP packet.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation of the OID within SNMP packets.
- The vulnerability is triggered by supplying a malformed packet containing an invalid OID, such as -1.
- Lack of proper error handling when encountering invalid OIDs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- The radius daemon (radiusd) crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing systems reliant on the affected Radius server for authentication.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attackers can trigger the vulnerability.
- The attack vector is through sending a malformed SNMP packet to the Radius server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the Radius server on port 161 (the default SNMP port).
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The Radius server must have been compiled with the `-enable-snmp` option to be vulnerable.
