GNU Radius SNMP Invalid OID Denial of Service Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 06.21.04
[www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=110&type=vulnerabilities](http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=110&type=vulnerabilities)
June 21, 2004

I. BACKGROUND

Radius is a server for remote user authentication and accounting. More
information about Radius is available at
<http://www.gnu.org/software/radius/radius.html>

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a denial of service condition within GNU Radius
allows attackers to crash the service.

The problem specifically exists in the code for handling SNMP messages.
By supplying a malformed packet containing an invalid OID, such as -1,
it is possible to cause the server to shutdown, preventing further
requests from being handled. The Radius server must have been compiled
with the '-enable-snmp' option in order to be vulnerable.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated remote attackers to cause
the radius daemon (radiusd) to crash. This prevents legitimate users
from accessing systems reliant upon the affected radius server for
authentication.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in GNU Radius
version 1.1. It is suspected that earlier versions are also
affected. Version 1.2 is not vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUNDS

Ingress filtering of UDP port 161 on all interfaces that should not be
receiving SNMP packets may lessen exposure to this vulnerability in
affected environments.

VI. VENDOR FIX

This issue has been fixed in GNU Radius version 1.2.

VII. CVE INFORMATION

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0576 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (<http://cve.mitre.org>), which standardizes names for
security problems.
