Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2004-0979:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The "Drag and drop or copy and paste files" security setting in Internet Explorer was not being honored on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Specifically, even when this setting was configured to "Disable" or "Prompt" for a particular security zone, the browser would still permit drag and drop or copy and paste operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypassed Security Preference:** The primary weakness is the failure of Internet Explorer to enforce its own security setting, which is designed to prevent potentially dangerous file operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Copy:** An attacker could convince a user to perform a drag-and-drop operation, enabling the attacker to copy arbitrary files to a known location on the user's computer.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If the target location is the "shell:startup" folder, the copied file (which could be a malicious executable) would be automatically executed the next time the user logs in.
*   **Combined with Other Vulnerabilities:** When combined with other vulnerabilities like VU#413886 and VU#490708 (mentioned in the CERT advisory), the drag-and-drop operation can be triggered through actions like dragging the IE scrollbar, selecting text, or clicking an image, thus increasing the attack surface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Drag and Drop Operation:** The user must be tricked into initiating a drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste operation. This can be achieved through malicious websites or specially crafted emails.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious Website/Email:** The attacker needs to host a malicious website or send an email that will entice the user to perform a drag and drop action from the attacker's controlled content to a local folder.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction to perform the drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste operation.
*   **Knowledge of target locations:** The attacker should know the location of sensitive folders or startup folders.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Operating System Scope:** The vulnerability affects Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.
*   **Solution:** Microsoft released a patch under [MS04-038](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-038.mspx) to address the issue.
*   **Patch Behavior:** Post-patch, the "Prompt" setting behaves like "Disable" on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems. Drag and drop operations are blocked, and no prompt is presented to the user.
