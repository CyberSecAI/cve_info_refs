{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2004-0130",
    "Root cause": "The login.php script in phpGedView does not properly check if required username or password parameters are present before using them. This input validation error leads to the disclosure of sensitive information.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Input Validation error",
      "Path Disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact": "Attackers can gather the true path of the server-side script, potentially revealing sensitive information about the system's file structure.",
    "Attack vector": "Remote attackers can send an HTTP request to login.php without the required username or password parameters. Or send a request with a missing parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
  }
