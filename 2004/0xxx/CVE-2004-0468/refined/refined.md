- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory leak occurs in the Juniper JUNOS Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) when certain IPv6 packets are processed. Specifically, when an incoming IPv6 packet requires the router to generate an ICMPv6 response, the response might not be generated, and the buffer containing the original packet might not be released.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory leak vulnerability in JUNOS PFE's IPv6 processing, specifically in how it handles ICMPv6 responses. The buffer containing the original IPv6 packet is not released when an ICMPv6 response is not generated.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Repeatedly sending specific IPv6 packets to a vulnerable Juniper router leads to memory exhaustion, causing the router to reboot. This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The router may reboot repeatedly if under sustained attack.

- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted IPv6 packets to a vulnerable Juniper router.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send IPv6 packets to the targeted router and does not need any authentication.
