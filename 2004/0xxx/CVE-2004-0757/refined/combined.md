## Mozilla contains a buffer overflow in the SendUidl() function

#### Vulnerability Note VU#561022

Original Release Date: 2004-08-20 | Last Revised: 2004-08-20

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way Mozilla handles certain types of POP3 responses could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.

### Description

| Post Office Protocol Version 3 ([POP3](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1939.txt)) is a mail protocol that provides a means for retrieving email from a remote server. This protocol is supported by [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/), [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/), and [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/). These clients contain a vulnerability that allows malformed POP3 responses to trigger a buffer overflow condition in the SendUidl() function. Such responses can be sent by a remote POP3 server and could result in arbitrary code execution. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By sending a specially crafted POP3 response to an affected client, a remote attacker could cause the client to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code. Exploitation of this vulnerability would require a user to connect to a malicious POP3 server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  Upgrade as specified by your vendor. This issue has been resolved in Mozilla 1.7, Firefox 0.9, and Thunderbird 0.7.2. |

more to do for [bug #157644](/show_bug.cgi?id=157644 "VERIFIED FIXED - Malicious pop3 server can write to arbitrary memory")...
dan got email from zen-parse@gmx.net, pointing out that the fix for #157644
plugged one security hole, but not them all.
from the reporter:
the correct fix is to limit the number of messages to (MAXINT(sizeof(Pop3MsgInfo))
if an evil server sends a larger number of messages, we'll only allocate space
for 50k. but if part way through the list, if the server introduces a message
that is < than the max but > 50k, we'll allocate more space.
SendUidl() doesn't bounds check on the 50k message limit.
the patch in [bug #157644](/show_bug.cgi?id=157644 "VERIFIED FIXED - Malicious pop3 server can write to arbitrary memory") assumes that message numbers are sequential.
I've got the complete email from zen-parse.

As far as I can tell, this is our only open bug which would allow a remote
server to take control of a Mozilla session. 'twould be nice if we could fix it :-)

over to david who has the fix and is going to land on trunk (he already landed
on the branch).
I'll log a bug about backing out [bug #157644](/show_bug.cgi?id=157644 "VERIFIED FIXED - Malicious pop3 server can write to arbitrary memory").
note, if we need to test this we can use servterm

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
