How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# MoinMoin: Group ACL bypass — GLSA **200407-09**

MoinMoin contains a bug allowing a user to bypass group ACLs (Access
Control Lists).

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/moinmoin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.2.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.2** |

### Background

MoinMoin is a Python clone of WikiWiki, based on PikiPiki.

### Description

MoinMoin contains a bug in the code handling administrative group ACLs.
A user created with the same name as an administrative group gains the
privileges of the administrative group.

### Impact

If an administrative group called AdminGroup existed an attacker could
create a user called AdminGroup and gain the privileges of the group
AdminGroup. This could lead to unauthorized users gaining
administrative access.

### Workaround

For every administrative group with special privileges create a user
with the same name as the group.

### Resolution

All users should upgrade to the latest available version of MoinMoin,
as follows:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=www-apps/moinmoin-1.2.2"
 # emerge ">=www-apps/moinmoin-1.2.2"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Carsten Lohrke (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-06 04:02:19 UTC  ``` Some bugs were fixed, including some critical security problems. There were also some minor feature improvements. <http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=8482&release_id=243709> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-06 04:45:40 UTC  ``` I'm not seeing the "critical" security fixes.  Looks like there have been some tweaks to some ACLs but I didn't see any mention of being able to bypass security in the old version.  Are there other links that talk about exactly what was wrong in the old version? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Carsten Lohrke (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-06 05:29:44 UTC  ``` Sorry, I stupidly copied from freshmeat in this case. I don't know why it's announced as a critical fix. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-06 07:22:41 UTC  ``` ok -- I'm going to re-assing to web-apps then as this seems more like a regular bump bug than a security problem.  If further information emerges that indicates there are important security problems with the previous version, please feel free to kick this back over to security. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Lance Albertson (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-21 12:14:56 UTC  ``` I found more info on this particular problem:  <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=948103&group_id=8482&atid=108482>  Sounds like it should have a security fix bump possibly. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Carsten Lohrke (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-24 06:28:49 UTC  ``` Sorry Kurt, you're back in the game. Don't know, if I was too blind to find it or just missed the info by a few hours. Thanks Lance! :) ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-24 12:47:52 UTC  ``` Fix is in 1.2.2, please bump. Target keywords : "x86 sparc ~amd64" ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Joshua J. Berry (CondorDes) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-29 13:28:42 UTC  ``` It installs ok with a simple copy of the ebuild to bump it, but it gives a warning about needing to be converted to use webapp.eclass instead of webapp-apache.eclass.  I have not actually tested its functionality. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-02 11:27:30 UTC  ``` web-apps : please bump, otherwise we'll have to mask the package. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-08 11:05:40 UTC  ``` masking. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-08 15:29:02 UTC  ``` Tested 1.2.2, works on x86.  Leaving arch-masked on sparc and amd64. Unmasked. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-09 01:10:10 UTC  ``` Reopening so that a GLSA can be issued. sparc: please mark net-www/moinmoin-1.2.2 stable. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Jason Wever (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-09 21:21:21 UTC  ``` Stable on sparc :) ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-10 03:12:03 UTC  ``` GLSA-ready ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-11 05:21:45 UTC  ``` GLSA drafted : security please review ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-11 06:36:11 UTC  ``` glsa 200407-09 ``` |  |
