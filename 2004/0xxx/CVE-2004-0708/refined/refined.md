Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2004-0708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how MoinMoin handles administrative group Access Control Lists (ACLs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  A user can bypass group ACLs. Specifically, if a user is created with the same name as an existing administrative group, that user inherits the privileges of the administrative group.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain unauthorized administrative access by creating a user with the same name as an administrative group. This could lead to various malicious activities, potentially compromising the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, as a user can create an account via the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to create a user account on the MoinMoin wiki. They do not need any special permissions beforehand.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in MoinMoin versions 1.2.1 and earlier and was fixed in version 1.2.2.
- A workaround was to create a user with the same name as each administrative group to prevent exploitation until the system could be updated.
