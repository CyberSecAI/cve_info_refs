Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Symantec Gateway Security management server object does not properly sanitize URLs included in error pages. Specifically, it fails to parse and remove HTML tags from the requested URL before displaying it back to the client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the error pages displayed by the management server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Session Hijacking: An attacker could steal authentication cookies, including the `JSESSIONID` cookie used to authenticate management sessions. This allows them to take control of the device.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Malicious scripts can be executed within the context of the trusted device, potentially leading to various malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted URL: An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing HTML/JavaScript code and send it to the Symantec Gateway Security server.
- Specifically, the URL must be handled by the Symantec Gateway Security server object, such as those under the `/sgmi` directory.
- An example URL would be like `<https://FirewallHostname:2456/sgmi/><script>badscript</script>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send a crafted URL to the Symantec Gateway Security server.
- No access control policy restricts the access to the management service by default, meaning that a remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this.
- The attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely, as the management service is accessible via a network.
