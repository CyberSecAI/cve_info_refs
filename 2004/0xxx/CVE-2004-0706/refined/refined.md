Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from including the user's login ID and password directly in the query string of the URL when generating a chart image. This occurs when a user attempts to access a chart after logging out, requiring them to log in again. The login credentials are then embedded in the image URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Password Exposure:** Usernames and passwords are sent in clear text within the URL. This exposes them in various places:
    *   Browser history
    *   Web server logs
    *   Referer headers
*   **Insecure handling of credentials**:  The application was passing authentication details via URL parameters, which is not a secure practice.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Compromise:** An attacker gaining access to the exposed URLs or server logs could steal user credentials.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** With stolen credentials, an attacker can access the Bugzilla system as the compromised user.
*   **Privacy breach:** User passwords and usernames are logged in server access logs

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker could potentially intercept the URL containing credentials if the connection is not encrypted.
*   **Log File Access:** An attacker with access to web server logs could retrieve the credentials.
*   **Browser History Access:** An attacker with local access to a user's machine can retrieve credentials from their browser history.
*   **Referer Header:** The referer header might contain the URL with credentials and be logged or exposed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to have access to the user's browser history, network traffic (if not encrypted), or web server logs. They can also get access through referer headers in some circumstances.
*   No specific access level or pre-existing privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability; knowledge of where to look for these URLs is enough.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report mentions that the issue exists because Bugzilla was designed to work (albeit less conveniently) without cookies. This led to the transmission of login information via the URL.
*   The immediate fix was to filter out the `Bugzilla_login` and `Bugzilla_password` parameters from the URL before generating the image.
*   A longer-term solution involving the implementation of one-time tokens was also proposed and a follow-up bug was opened for it.
