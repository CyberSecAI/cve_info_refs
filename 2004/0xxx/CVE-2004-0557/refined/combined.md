| [Description](#c0)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-29 01:32:15 UTC  ``` From Fedora Core 1 advisory :  ---------------------------------- Updated sox packages that fix buffer overflows in the WAV file handling code are now available.  Buffer overflows existed in the parsing of WAV file header fields. It was possible that a malicious WAV file could have caused arbitrary code to be executed when the file was played or converted. ----------------------------------  This is CAN-2004-0557. Patch available at <http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=128158> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-29 01:34:55 UTC  ``` sound team : please apply fix and bump ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Chris White (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-29 02:19:15 UTC  ``` Bumped to -r2 with patch.  Kept stable keywords as the patch is trivial and would not cause stability to be hindered in any way. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-29 05:59:50 UTC  ``` GLSA drafted : security please review ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Jeremy Huddleston (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-29 11:03:11 UTC  ``` Thanks Chris.  I agree with him that  it is trivial and we don't need to ask the archs to rekeyword this version, but alpha has keyworded 12.17.3-r3 but was removed from 12.7.4-r1.  Alpha, pleasse test 12.7.4-r2 on your arch. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-30 08:02:17 UTC  ``` GLSA 200407-23 alpha : please remember to mark stable to benefit from the GLSA ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Bryan Østergaard (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-30 11:25:07 UTC  ``` Stable on alpha - sorry about the delay. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Luke Macken (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-13 16:09:51 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 67482](show_bug.cgi?id=67482 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - media-sound/sox: remote buffer overflow") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` |  |

# SoX: Multiple buffer overflows — GLSA **200407-23**

SoX contains two buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the WAV header parser
code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-sound/sox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **12.17.4-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **12.17.4-r2** |

### Background

SoX is a command line utility that can convert various formats of
computer audio files in to other formats.

### Description

Ulf Harnhammar discovered two buffer overflows in the sox and play
commands when handling WAV files with specially crafted header fields.

### Impact

By enticing a user to play or convert a specially crafted WAV file an
attacker could execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
running SoX.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version of SoX.

### Resolution

All SoX users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=media-sound/sox-12.17.4-r2"
 # emerge ">=media-sound/sox-12.17.4-r2"
```

Package        : sox
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0557
Debian Bug     : 262083

Ulf Harnhammar has reported two vulnerabilities in SoX, a universal
sound sample translator, which may be exploited by malicious people to
compromise a user's system with a specially crafted .wav file.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 12.17.3-4woody2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 12.17.4-9.

We recommend that you upgrade your sox package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# SoX buffer overflows when handling .WAV files

SoX buffer overflows when handling .WAV files

I have found two buffer overflows in SoX. They occur when the sox
or play commands handle malicious .WAV files. The overflows have
the identifier CAN-2004-0557.

Versions 12.17.4, 12.17.3 and 12.17.2 are vulnerable to these
overflows. Vulnerable versions of the program are included in many
Linux distributions and *BSD Port/Package Collections. Older versions
including 12.17.1, 12.17 and 12.16 are not vulnerable.

SoX may not be the most security critical program, but it is possible
to exploit this. Some attack vectors are social engineering (I have
used play to play .WAV files from untrusted sources several times
before I found this), programs that use SoX to play data from the net
(examples include JiveAudio and vmail), and people who put play in
their mailcap files (so it plays sound files in MIME messages as
soon as the messages are opened). It is also interesting to note
that xmms can play .WAV files with this type of data just fine.

Both overflows occur in wav.c in the function st_wavstartread().
In both cases, the program first reads 4 bytes from the .WAV file
into a variable. Then it reads as many bytes as that variable says
from the .WAV file into a 256 bytes long char array, without checking
if the data from the .WAV file fits in that array. This leads to a
stack-based buffer overflow with control over EIP, as you can see
in this session capture:

I have attached a .WAV file that causes a buffer overflow, as well
as a patch against 12.17.4 that stops both overflows.

I contacted upstream, the vendor-sec list and naddy (an
OpenBSD/FreeBSD guy) on the 18th of July. I received the CAN/CVE
identifier on the same day. The 28th was agreed upon as the release
date, so I am releasing this now.

Greetings to Sitic, Sanctum Inc, Secunia, OWASP, Gobbles, F-Secure,
Ladytron, Vic Twenty (the band), Naked Ape, Slagsmalsklubben and
everyone from the Debian Security Audit Project.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2004-235
2004-07-28
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Product     : Fedora Core 1
Name        : sox
Version     : 12.17.4
Release     : 4.fc1
Summary     : A general purpose sound file conversion tool.
Description :
SoX (Sound eXchange) is a sound file format converter SoX can convert
between many different digitized sound formats and perform simple
sound manipulation functions, including sound effects.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Updated sox packages that fix buffer overflows in the WAV file handling
code are now available.

Buffer overflows existed in the parsing of WAV file header fields. It
was possible that a malicious WAV file could have caused arbitrary code to
be executed when the file was played or converted.
