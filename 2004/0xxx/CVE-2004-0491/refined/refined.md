Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-0491:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in a patch for `mlock` (memory locking) included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 (RHEL3). The `mlock` patch intended to allow users to lock memory within their resource limits (`rlimits`). However, the accounting of locked memory was flawed when Inter-Process Communication (IPC) was involved.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Accounting:** The core issue was that if one process/user locked memory (using `mlock`), and another process/user unlocked it (using `munlock`), the unlocking process's locked memory counter was decremented, even though it wasn't the process that originally performed the lock.
- **Bypass of Resource Limits:** This incorrect accounting allowed an unprivileged user to potentially bypass their `mlock` resource limits by having a separate process unlock the memory they had locked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** By bypassing the `mlock` resource limit, an unprivileged user could gain the ability to lock more memory than they were supposed to. This could potentially be used to perform denial of service attacks or other forms of privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** The vulnerability specifically requires two or more processes that can communicate via IPC.
- **`mlock` and `munlock` system calls:**  The attack involves one process using `mlock` and a separate process using `munlock`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to run multiple processes:** The attacker needs to be able to create or control at least two processes that can communicate with each other.
- **User-level access:** The attacker does not need administrative privileges to exploit this vulnerability. Any user with the ability to execute programs can trigger it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered around June 2004 and fixed in Fedora Core 2.
- A non-kABI-breaking patch was developed for RHEL3 and included in kernel versions 2.4.21-32.3.EL and 2.4.21-32.0.1.EL.
- The bug report mentions that the issue was reported by Arjan around June 7 and fixed in FC2 (1.427 on Jun11).
- Red Hat issued security advisory RHSA-2005:472 to address the issue.
