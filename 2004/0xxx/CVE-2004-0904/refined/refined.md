  "CVE-2004-0904": {
    "description": "Multiple integer overflow errors exist in the way that some versions of Mozilla products handle bitmap images (.bmp). These errors result in various vulnerabilities when the affected application handles overly wide bitmap files.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflows in the BMP image processing code within Mozilla products.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer overflow when calculating the size of the buffer needed to store the bitmap data.",
        "Heap buffer overflow in RLE decoder when processing RLE encoded BMP images, allowing arbitrary data to be written to the heap."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected software. In other cases, an attacker may cause the affected program to crash (Denial of Service).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Viewing a specially crafted BMP image through a web page.",
      "Viewing a specially crafted BMP image within an email message."
