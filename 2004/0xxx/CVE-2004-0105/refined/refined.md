           "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker"

         "additional_details": "The first buffer overflow occurs when a message has encoded non-ASCII characters in the mail headers and the part that names a character set is overly long. The overflow is in the function PrintHeader() in metamail.c. The second buffer overflow occurs in the splitmail executable when a message has an overly long Subject header. The overflow is caused by a bad strcpy() in the function ShareThisHeader() in splitmail.c. Metamail programs are often automatically invoked by mail readers or other mail handling applications."
