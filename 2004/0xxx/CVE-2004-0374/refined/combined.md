------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's new in each version of Interchange
(since the version 5.0 branch)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interchange 5.0.2 released 2005-09-22.
Security
--------
\* Fix ITL injection hole in pages/forum/submit.html.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interchange 5.0.1 released 2004-03-29.
Security
--------
\* Plug a security hole which allows an attacker to expose arbitrary variable
contents by using an URL like
http://shop.example.com/cgi-bin/store/\_\_SQLUSER\_\_.
All Interchange applications using the standard "missing" special page
from the demo catalog or a similar one are vulnerable to this attack.
The attacker may learn the SQL access information for your Interchange
application and use this information to read and manipulate sensitive
data.
\* Disallow [ and < in page names when setting MV\_PAGE and MV\_PREV\_PAGE
variables.
\* Prevent login information from getting re-saved on a session cancel.
\* Define a set of CGI keys that we don't want to save to disk, as
@Global::HideCGI.
\* Don't show sensitive (i.e. @Global::HideCGI) CGI variables in a dump.
This allows saving a session to disk for diagnositic purposes in case
of order failure.
Core
----
\* Allow [dump no-cgi=1 no-session=1 no-env=1] to finetune dump.
\* Tolerate leading whitespace in query in Vend::Form.
Admin
-----
\* Fix bug where affiliate reports don't filter based on that.
\* Make reports with no specified end\_date work.
\* Fix missing relocation variables in Vend::Table::Editor found by Paul
Vinciguerra.
Usertags
--------
\* history-scan: Make pageonly=1 option work correctly when there's no
History saved in the user's session.
Foundation
----------
\* Remove unmatched  from cart\_display component.
Debian
------
\* Add libhtml-parser-perl to Build-Depends to keep HTML::Entities
module out of the package (Closes: #224435, thanks to Henrik Holmboe
 for the bug report)
\* Switch to gettext-based debconf templates (Closes: #235494, thanks to
Martin Quinson  for the patch)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# [Interchange-announce] Security Problem in Interchange

**Stefan Hornburg**
racke at linuxia.de

*Mon Mar 29 06:56:33 EST 2004*

* Next message: [[Interchange-announce] Security Problem in Interchange (Update for
  4.8.x)](000044.html)
* **Messages sorted by:**
  [[ date ]](date.html#43)
  [[ thread ]](thread.html#43)

```
Dear Interchange community !

All versions of Interchange (4.8.x, 5.0.x, 5.1.x) contain a security hole
which allows an attacker to expose arbitrary variable contents by using
an URL like <http://shop.example.com/cgi-bin/store/__SQLUSER__.>

All Interchange applications using the standard "missing" special page
from the demo catalog or a similar one are vulnerable to this attack.
The attacker may learn the SQL access information for your Interchange
application and use this information to read and manipulate sensitive
data.

Attached are patches for the following Interchange versions:

4.8.x:     Page-4.8.diff
5.0.x:     Page-5.0.diff
5.1.x/CVS: Page-5.1.diff

To apply the patch for your Interchange version, enter the
directory Vend resp. lib/Vend below your Interchange installation
directory and run the following command:

patch -p3 < /path/to/Page.diff

Please replace the file name of the patch file with the
appropriate location.

Tarballs and Debian packages for Interchange 4.8.8 and Interchange 5.0.1
will be released shortly.

	Racke
