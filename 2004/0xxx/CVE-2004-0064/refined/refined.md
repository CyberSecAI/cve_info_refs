{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The `SuSEconfig.gnome-filesystem` script creates temporary directories in `/tmp` using a predictable random number, making it vulnerable to symlink attacks. Specifically, the script uses `$RANDOM` which generates predictable numbers, and then uses this value to create a temporary directory which is then used to create a file that is later used to write output. If an attacker can create a directory with the same name and include a symlink with the target file path before the script runs, the script will write to the target instead of a file in `/tmp`. ",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Predictable temporary file/directory creation",
        "Symlink following",
        "Insufficient access control during file creation."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can create or overwrite arbitrary files on the system, leading to potential privilege escalation, data corruption, or denial of service. ",
      "attack_vectors": "A local user can exploit this vulnerability.",
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user on the vulnerable system and needs to create the symlink before the vulnerable script runs. The attacker needs to run a custom script that creates directories in `/tmp` and creates symlinks to a file on the filesystem."
