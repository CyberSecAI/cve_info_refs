## LibTIFF contains multiple integer overflows

#### Vulnerability Note VU#687568

Original Release Date: 2004-12-01 | Last Revised: 2005-01-25

---

### Overview

Multiple integer overflows in the LibTIFF library may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| LibTIFF is a library used to encode and decode images in [Tag Image File Format (TIFF)](http://www.libtiff.org/) format. A number of potential integer overflow errors exist in the LibTIFF library. A lack of input validation on user-controlled data may allow a remote attacker to manipulate calls to the malloc() routine.  One instance of these vulnerabilities is in the TIFFFetchStripThing()routine within the tif\_dirread.c file. A lack of validation on data specifying the size of an TIFF image may allow a remote attacker to manipulte malloc()to create a buffer with insufficient size. When data is copied to this under-sized buffer, a heap-based buffer overflow may occur. In order to exploit this specific attack vector, an attacker must craft a TIFF image with the STRIPOFFSETS flag set.Please note that other routines may be vulnerable. In addition, any application that uses the LibTIFF library may be affected by this issue. Users are encouraged to contact their vendors to determine if they are vulnerable. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Depending on the application being used and the attack vector being exploited, potential consequences range from a denial-of-service condition to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the LibTIFF process. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**  Patch or upgrade as specified by your vendor. Users who suspect they are vulnerable are encouraged to check with their vendor to determine the appropriate action to take. |

KDE Security Advisory: kfax libtiff vulnerabilities
Original Release Date: 2004-12-09
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20041209-2.txt
0. References
CAN-2004-0803
CAN-2004-0804
CAN-2004-0886
1. Systems affected:
All KDE releases earlier than KDE 3.3.2.
2. Overview:
Chris Evans and others discovered multiple vulnerabilities
in the libtiff library. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project assigned CAN-2004-0803 to this issue.
kfax, a small utility for displaying fax files, contains
for historic reasons a private copy of libtiff. Therefore
it is vulnerable to these issues as well.
kfax and the kfax KPart are invoked by KMail or Konqueror
for viewing .g3 files.
For the active KDE maintenance branches, which are
KDE 3.2.x and KDE 3.3.x, this problem has been solved by
removing the private copy of libtiff. In KDE 3.2.x, kfax
will use the tiff2ps and fax2tiff utilities at runtime as
backend. In KDE 3.3.x the code requiring libtiff or any other
runtime dependencies has been replaced by a native solution
that is unaffected by the mentioned vulnerabilities.
Due to the complexity of the change, no simple diff is
provided. The problems have been addressed in the KDE 3.3.2
release.
As a workaround, you can remove the kfax binary and the
kfaxpart.la KPart from your system to be on the safe
side.
3. Impact:
Specially crafted fax files can trigger buffer overflows
in libtiff and execute arbitrary code.
4. Solution:
Source code updates have been made available which fix these
vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.
5. Patch:
No patches are being made available due to complexity of the change.
6. Time line and credits:
13/10/2004 KDE Security Team alerted by Than Ngo
28/10/2004 private libtiff fork removed from CVS, updated
packages finished.
XX/11/2004 Regression fixing, several refinements.

Description:
  According to security advisory CESA-2004-006 from Chris Evans, the
  libtiff [[0]](#0) image en-/decoder suffers from several heap based buffer
  overflows. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project
  assigned the id CAN-2004-0803 [[1]](#1) to the problem.

  Other code reviewers found integer overflows which affect memory
  allocation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project
  assigned the id CAN-2004-0886 [[2]](#2) to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/openpkg
  rpm -q tiff". If you have the "tiff" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution) and its dependent packages (see above), if any, too
  [3][[4]](#4).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][[6]](#6), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][[8]](#8) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[9]](#9), build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [[3]](#3) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [[4]](#4). For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.1, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.1/UPD
  ftp> get tiff-3.6.1-2.1.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig tiff-3.6.1-2.1.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild tiff-3.6.1-2.1.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/tiff-3.6.1-2.1.1.*.rpm

  Additionally, we recommend that you rebuild and reinstall
  all dependent packages (see above), if any, too [3][[4]](#4).

<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
October 15th, 2004                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : tiff
Vulnerability  : heap overflows
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0803 CAN-2004-0804 CAN-2004-0886

Several problems have been discovered in libtiff, the Tag Image File
Format library for processing TIFF graphics files.  An attacker could
prepare a specially crafted TIFF graphic that would cause the client
to execute arbitrary code or crash.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures Project has identified the following problems:

CAN-2004-0803

    Chris Evans discovered several problems in the RLE (run length
    encoding) decoders that could lead to arbitrary code execution.

CAN-2004-0804

    Matthias Clasen discovered a division by zero through an integer
    overflow.

CAN-2004-0886

    Dmitry V. Levin discovered several integer overflows that caused
    malloc issues which can result to either plain crash or memory
    corruption.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.5-6woody1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.1-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libtiff package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
