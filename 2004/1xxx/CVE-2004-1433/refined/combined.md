## Multiple Cisco ONS control cards fail to properly handle malformed TCP packets

#### Vulnerability Note VU#800384

Original Release Date: 2004-07-27 | Last Revised: 2004-08-05

---

### Overview

A vulnerability exists in multiple control cards used by Cisco ONS devices. This vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| Cisco's [Optical Networking](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/optical/) product line consists of a series of devices designed to offer high-bandwidth data services. These optical devices are managed through a series of control cards, which vary depending on the model of the device. There is a vulnerability in the way the XTC, TCC/TCC+/TCC2, TCCi/TCC2, and TSC control cards handle malformed TCP packets. By sending specially crafted TCP packets to a vulnerable optical device, a remote attacker could cause the control cards to reset.  **Vulnerable**Cisco ONS 15327 Edge Optical Transport Platform releases:     + 4.6(0) and 4.6(1) + 4.1(0) to 4.1(3) + 4.0(0) to 4.0(2) + 3.x(x) and earlier  Cisco ONS 15454 Optical Transport Platform releases:    + 4.6(0) and 4.6(1) + 4.5(x) + 4.1(0) to 4.1(3) + 4.0(0) to 4.0(2) + 3.x(x) + earlier than 2.3(5)  Cisco ONS 15454 SDH Multiplexer Platform releases:    + 4.6(0) and 4.6(1) + 4.5(x) + 4.1(0) to 4.1(3) + 4.0(0) to 4.0(2) + 3.x(x) + earlier than 2.3(5)  Cisco ONS 15600 Multiservice Switching Platform    + 1.x(x) |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker could cause control cards to reset on an affected optical device. Repeated exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a denial of service.For more information on the impact of this vulnerability, please refer to the "[Impact](http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20040721-ons.shtml#impact)" section of the [Cisco Advisory](http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20040721-ons.shtml). |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**Please refer to the "[Software Versions and Fixes](http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20040721-ons.shtml#software)" section of the [Cisco Advisory](http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20040721-ons.shtml) for more information on upgrading. |
