How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

   VizibleSoft Security Advisory #2004/01                       25th Mar 2004

   <http://viziblesoft.com/insect/advisories/vz012004-esignal7.txt>
   insect@viziblesoft.com
 ===========-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-===========

   Product:     eSignal 7.6, 7.5 (maybe earlier)
                <http://www.esignal.com>

   Systems:     Windows (all versions)

   Problem:     Stack-based buffer overflow

   Severity:    Remote code execution

   Risk:        High
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Product description:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   "eSignal is the nation's leading provider of real-time financial and
   market information. eSignal is a popular platform for institutional
   and professional traders. eSignal is a market data solution bundled
   for best value for small to mid-size institutional investors that
   also includes additional optional services..."

   Vulnerability:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   eSignal main application "WinSig.exe" listens for incoming data
   requests on tcp port 80.

   While parsing requests, it suffers from classic stack-based buffer
   overflow, when parameter string is about 1040 characters long:

   C:\>telnet localhost 80
   <STREAMQUOTE>
   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA....... x 1040
   </STREAMQUOTE>

    ... bang!

   Overflow occurs in Specs.dll and EIP is fully controllable, as
   the function return address on the stack is completelly overwritten.

   Exploitation:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Pretty trivial, except that overflow string can not contain NULL-bytes
   and all lower-case characters are converted to upper-case.

   As we overwrite stack with return address and code, we use standard
   "JMP ESP" technique to direct execution back to us.

   "jmp esp" opcode was found in MFC71.dll, which is distributed in eSignal
   package and loads from program folder, thus making exploit to be eSignal
   version specific instead of OS (Windoze) specific.

   While I was working on advisory, eSignal released v7.6 which is
   vulnerable as well and even more "overflow-friendly", as previous
   was compiled with debug bits for ESP value checking at the end of each
   procedure. But in both cases it's almost similar.

   Proof of concept code:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Exploit written in Perl, which downloads and executes file from
   the specified URL available here:

   <http://viziblesoft.com/insect/sploits/vz-eSignal76.pl>

   Solution:
   ~~~~~~~~~
   Vendor's technical support ignored my request for company's security
   contacts. I wasn't surprised, as the most support staff these days is
   zombified and can't figure out doing something they were not programmed
   to. Plus, company falls into category of "those who does not care"
   moneymakers, so after two weeks time I realized there won't be
   any answer.

   Thus, solution is obvious:

   Close tcp 80 to outside world with your favorite firewall.

also includes additional optional services..."
Vulnerability:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
eSignal main application "WinSig.exe" listens for incoming data
requests on tcp port 80.
While parsing requests, it suffers from classic stack-based buffer
overflow, when parameter string is about 1040 characters long:
C:\>telnet localhost 80
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA....... x 1040

... bang!
Overflow occurs in Specs.dll and EIP is fully controllable, as
the function return address on the stack is completelly overwritten.
Exploitation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pretty trivial, except that overflow string can not contain NULL-bytes
and all lower-case characters are converted to upper-case.
As we overwrite stack with return address and code, we use standard
"JMP ESP" technique to direct execution back to us.
"jmp esp" opcode was found in MFC71.dll, which is distributed in eSignal
package and loads from program folder, thus making exploit to be eSignal
version specific instead of OS (Windoze) specific.
While I was working on advisory, eSignal released v7.6 which is
vulnerable as well and even more "overflow-friendly", as previous
was compiled with debug bits for ESP value checking at the end of each
procedure. But in both cases it's almost similar.
Proof of concept code:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Exploit written in Perl, which downloads and executes file from
the specified URL available here:

Solution:
~~~~~~~~~
Vendor's technical support ignored my request for company's security
contacts. I wasn't surprised, as the most support staff these days is
zombified and can't figure out doing something they were not programmed
to. Plus, company falls into category of "those who does not care"
moneymakers, so after two weeks time I realized there won't be
any answer.
Thus, solution is obvious:
Close tcp 80 to outside world with your favorite firewall.
