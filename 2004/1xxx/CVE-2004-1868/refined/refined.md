Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which matches the information for CVE-2004-1868:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the eSignal application "WinSig.exe" when parsing incoming data requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application listens on TCP port 80 for data requests and fails to properly validate the length of incoming data.
- Specifically, when a parameter string exceeds approximately 1040 characters, it overflows a buffer on the stack.
- Lower-case characters in the overflow string are converted to upper-case, and null bytes cannot be used.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the eSignal process.
- The attacker can fully control the EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer) register by overwriting the function return address on the stack.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted data request to TCP port 80.
- A simple telnet connection can be used to send the malicious string.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable eSignal application, specifically the ability to send data to TCP port 80.
- The attacker must construct a string of approximately 1040 characters that does not include null bytes and accounts for case conversion.
- The attacker uses the "JMP ESP" technique to redirect execution to their shellcode, which can be placed within the overflowed buffer. The address to jump to is version-specific due to the "jmp esp" instruction being found in MFC71.dll located within the eSignal program folder.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in eSignal versions 7.6 and 7.5 (and possibly earlier versions).
- The vulnerability is in the Specs.dll library.
- A proof-of-concept exploit is available as a Perl script which downloads and executes a file from a specified URL
- The vendor's technical support was unresponsive to vulnerability reports.
- Mitigation involves blocking access to TCP port 80 using a firewall.
