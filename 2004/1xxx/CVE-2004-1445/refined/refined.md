Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2004-1445:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A race condition exists in the `nessus-adduser` script. This occurs specifically when a user has not configured their `TMPDIR` environment variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability lies in a race condition within the `nessus-adduser` script, which is used to add users to the Nessus security scanner. This race condition can be triggered when the `TMPDIR` variable is not set.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious local user can exploit this race condition to elevate their privileges to those of the user running the `nessus-adduser` script. This means an attacker could gain root or administrator level control of the system on which nessus is running.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have an account on the system where the vulnerable Nessus installation is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a local account on the system running the affected version of Nessus.
- The attacker must be able to execute commands on the system, including triggering the `nessus-adduser` script.
- The attacker must be able to trigger the race condition, which occurs when the `TMPDIR` variable is not set in the user's environment.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Nessus versions 2.0.11 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Nessus version 2.0.12.
- Gentoo Linux released a security advisory (GLSA 200408-11) regarding this issue.
- The fix involved addressing the race condition in `nessus-adduser`.

This information is consistent with the CVE description which is a race condition vulnerability.
