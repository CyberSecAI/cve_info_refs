{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The WebAPP system has a directory traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input validation in the 'viewcat' parameter of the 'index.cgi' script.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Directory Traversal",
        "Insufficient Input Validation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive files like '/etc/passwd' and user database files containing DES-encrypted passwords. This can lead to full server compromise and unauthorized access to user accounts.",
      "attack_vectors": "By manipulating the 'viewcat' parameter in the URL, using directory traversal sequences (e.g., '../../../../../../etc/passwd%00'), an attacker can specify file paths outside of the intended directory.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerable script ('index.cgi') and the ability to modify URL parameters in a web browser. No special privileges or network access beyond HTTP access are required."
