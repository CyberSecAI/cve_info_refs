Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper initialization of the `$p` array in `rss.php` before it's used in `$bBlog->make_post_query()`.
- When `register_globals` is enabled on the web server, user-supplied input can directly populate the `$p` array without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is an SQL injection, allowing a malicious user to inject arbitrary SQL code through the unfiltered `$p` array.
- **Uninitialized Variable:** The lack of initialization of `$p` before usage is the root of the issue, making the script vulnerable when `register_globals` is enabled.
- **Reliance on `register_globals`:** The vulnerability is exacerbated by reliance on `register_globals` (a PHP setting), which is now considered a security risk, enabling user input to directly populate variables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Administrative Access:** A remote attacker can gain administrative privileges by manipulating the SQL query.
- **Credential Exposure:** The attacker can access the admin user's credentials.
- **Complete System Compromise**:  The details imply the attacker could gain full control over the application due to gaining administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL, POST data, or cookie to inject SQL into the `$p` array.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The attack can be performed remotely, without prior access to the system or special credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web server.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** Knowledge of HTTP request construction (URL parameters, POST data, cookies).
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker must know how to construct malicious SQL injection strings.
- **Vulnerable Configuration:** The target server must have `register_globals` enabled.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** bBlog versions 0.7.2 and 0.7.3 are affected.
- **Severity:** The issue is classified as severe due to the potential for complete system compromise.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.7.4, and a patch for `rss.php` in version 0.7.3 is available.
