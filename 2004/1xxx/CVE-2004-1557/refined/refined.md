Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in MyWebServer 1.0.3:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The server crashes when it receives more than 107 rapid connections to the HTTP service. This likely indicates a lack of proper resource management, such as a fixed-size buffer or insufficient handling of concurrent connections.
*   **Admin Panel Access without Authentication:** The `/admin` directory and its contents, particularly `/admin/ServerProperties.html`, are accessible without any authentication or password checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DoS:** Lack of proper connection handling and resource management leading to a crash.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  Admin panel is accessible without authentication.
*   **Privilege Escalation/Configuration Tampering:**  Unauthenticated access to `/admin/ServerProperties.html` allows modification of server properties and creation of FTP accounts with arbitrary paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **DoS:**  The server becomes unavailable, disrupting service for legitimate users.
*   **Admin Panel Access:** Attackers can modify server settings, create FTP accounts, and gain access to the file system by creating FTP accounts with arbitrary paths, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, or other malicious activities.
*   **Arbitrary File Access:** Through FTP account creation with arbitrary paths, remote attackers can view any file on the server's hard drive.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **DoS:** Sending more than 107 rapid connections to the HTTP service.
*   **Admin Panel Access:** Directly accessing the `/admin` or `/admin/ServerProperties.html` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **DoS:** The attacker needs to be able to establish network connections to the target web server.
*   **Admin Panel Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target web server.
