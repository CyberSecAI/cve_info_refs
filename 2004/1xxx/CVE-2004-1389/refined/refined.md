  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Input validation error in the Veritas NetBackup Administrative Assistant interface (bpjava-susvc) allows for the execution of arbitrary commands.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with elevated (possibly root) privileges on a vulnerable NetBackup server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted commands to the bpjava-susvc process",
      "Exploiting the Backup & Restore GUI if started as root"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs access to a vulnerable NetBackup server to send crafted commands. If the Backup & Restore GUI is started as root, it can also be exploited.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists when the NetBackup Administrative Java GUI connects to a NetBackup server, which starts the `bpjava-susvc` process on the server. A normal user can send crafted commands to this process. The vulnerability affects NetBackup BusinessServer, DataCenter, and Enterprise Server versions 3.4, 3.4.1, 4.5, 5.0, and 5.1. A workaround is to set the `NBJAVA_CONNECT_OPTION` to 1 in the NetBackup configuration file."
