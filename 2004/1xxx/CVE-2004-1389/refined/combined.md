## Veritas NetBackup "bpjava-susvc" process contains an input validation error

#### Vulnerability Note VU#685456

Original Release Date: 2005-01-18 | Last Revised: 2005-04-20

---

### Overview

Veritas NetBackup Administrative Assistant interface may allow users to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.

### Description

| The Veritas NetBackup Administrative Assistant interface (bpjava-susvc) contains an input validation vulnerability. According to [Veritas Alert 271727](http://seer.support.veritas.com/docs/271727.htm) :  *When the NetBackup Administrative Java GUI connects to a NetBackup server (either a master or media server) a process is started on the server called bpjava-susvc. A normal user with access to this server could send specially crafted commands to this process and have those commands executed with root authority.**It is also possible to exploit this issue if the Backup & Restore GUI is started as root.*The following NetBackup applications and versions are reported to be vulnerable:     + NetBackup BusinesServer 3.4, 3.4.1, and 4.5 + NetBackup DataCenter 3.4, 3.4.1, and 4.5 + NetBackup Enterprise Server 5.1 + NetBackup Server 5.0 and 5.1 |
| --- |

### Impact

| If an attacker supplies a vulnerable NetBackup server with specially crafted commands, those commands may be executed with elevated (possibly root) privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**According to [Veritas Alert 271727](http://seer.support.veritas.com/docs/271727.htm) the following patches will correct this problem:       - 4.5 Maintenance Pack 8 (MP8) - 4.5 Feature Pack 8 (FP8) - 5.0 Maintenance Pack 4 (MP4) - 5.1 Maintenance Pack 2 (MP2)  **Upgrade**This issue will be fixed in Veritas NetBackup version 6. |
| --- |

| **Workaround**  Enabling no call-back will correct this issue. To enable no call-back set the NBJAVA\_CONNECT\_OPTION to 1 in the NetBackup configuration file (nbj.conf on UNIX and .vrtsnbuj on Windows).Veritas released the following examples to demonstrate how to set NBJAVA\_CONNECT\_OPTION to 1 on Windows and UNIX platforms:Partial sample of a Windows <NB Installed location>\java\<host\_name>.vrtsnbuf file:   # Backslashes in the install path must be escaped.# An example: "C:\\Program Files\\VERITAS\\java"SET INSTALL\_PATH=C:\\Program Files\\VERITAS\\\\JavaSET SERVER\_HOST=master.min.veritas.comSET NBJAVA\_CONNECT\_OPTION=1 Partial sample of a UNIX /usr/openv/java/nbj.conf file:  # $Revision: 1.3 $#bcpyrght#\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*#\* $VRTScprght: Copyright 1993 - 2003 VERITAS Software Corporation, All Rights Reserved $ \*#\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*#ecpyrghtBPJAVA\_PORT=13722VNETD\_PORT=13724NBJAVA\_CONNECT\_OPTION=1 |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
