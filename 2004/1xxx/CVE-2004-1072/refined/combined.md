How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Synopsis: Linux kernel binfmt\_elf loader vulnerabilities
Product: Linux kernel
Version: 2.4 up to and including 2.4.27, 2.6 up to and including
2.6.8
Vendor: http://www.kernel.org/
URL: http://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0017-binfmt\_elf.txt
CVE: not assigned
Author: Paul Starzetz
Date: Nov 10, 2004
Issue:
======
Numerous bugs have been found in the Linux ELF binary loader while
handling setuid binaries.
Details:
========
On Unix like systems the execve(2) system call provides functionality to
replace the current process by a new one (usually found in binary form
on the disk) or in other words to execute a new program.
Internally the Linux kernel uses a binary format loader layer to
implement the low level format dependend functionality of the execve()
system call. The common execve code contains just few helper functions
used to load the new binary and leaves the format specific work to a
specialized binary format loader.
One of the Linux format loaders is the ELF (Executable and Linkable
Format) loader. Nowadays ELF is the standard format for Linux binaries
besides the a.out binary format, which is not used in practice anymore.
One of the functions of a binary format loader is to properly handle
setuid executables, that is executables with the setuid bit set on the
file system image of the executable. It allows execution of programs
under a different user ID than the user issuing the execve call but is
some lacy work from security point of view.
Every ELF binary contains an ELF header defining the type and the layout
of the program in memory as well as addition sections (like which
program interpreter to load, symbol table, etc). The ELF header normally
contains information about the entry point (start address) of the binary
and the position of the memory map header (phdr) in the binary image and
the program interpreter (that is normally the dynamic linker ld-
linux.so). The memory map header definies the memory mapping of the
executable file that can be seen later from /proc/self/maps.
We have indentified 5 different flaws in the Linux ELF binary loader
(linux/fs/binfmt\_elf.c all line numbers for 2.4.27):
1) wrong return value check while filling kernel buffers (loop to scan
the binary header for an interpreter section):
static int load\_elf\_binary(struct linux\_binprm \* bprm, struct pt\_regs \* regs)
{
size = elf\_ex.e\_phnum \* sizeof(struct elf\_phdr);
elf\_phdata = (struct elf\_phdr \*) kmalloc(size, GFP\_KERNEL);
if (!elf\_phdata)
goto out;
477: retval = kernel\_read(bprm->file, elf\_ex.e\_phoff, (char \*) elf\_phdata, size);
if (retval < 0)
goto out\_free\_ph;
The above code looks good on the first glance, however checking the
return value of kernel\_read (which calls file->f\_op->read) to be non-
negative is not sufficient since a read() can perfectly return less than
the requested buffer size bytes. This bug happens also on lines 301,
523, 545 respectively.
2) incorrect on error behaviour, if the mmap() call fails (loop to mmap
binary sections into memory):
645: for(i = 0, elf\_ppnt = elf\_phdata; i < elf\_ex.e\_phnum; i++, elf\_ppnt++) {
684: error = elf\_map(bprm->file, load\_bias + vaddr, elf\_ppnt, elf\_prot, elf\_flags);
if (BAD\_ADDR(error))
continue;
3) bad return value vulnerability while mapping the program interpreter
into memory:
301: retval = kernel\_read(interpreter,interp\_elf\_ex->e\_phoff,(char \*)elf\_phdata,size);
error = retval;
if (retval < 0)
goto out\_close;
eppnt = elf\_phdata;
for (i=0; ie\_phnum; i++, eppnt++) {
map\_addr = elf\_map(interpreter, load\_addr + vaddr, eppnt, elf\_prot, elf\_type);
322: if (BAD\_ADDR(map\_addr))
goto out\_close;
out\_close:
kfree(elf\_phdata);
out:
return error;
}
4) the loaded interpreter section can contain an interpreter name string
without the terminating NULL:
508: for (i = 0; i < elf\_ex.e\_phnum; i++) {
518: elf\_interpreter = (char \*) kmalloc(elf\_ppnt->p\_filesz,
GFP\_KERNEL);
if (!elf\_interpreter)
goto out\_free\_file;
retval = kernel\_read(bprm->file, elf\_ppnt->p\_offset,
elf\_interpreter,
elf\_ppnt->p\_filesz);
if (retval < 0)
goto out\_free\_interp;
5) bug in the common execve() code in exec.c: vulnerability in
open\_exec() permitting reading of non-readable ELF binaries, which can
be triggered by requesting the file in the ELF PT\_INTERP section:
541: interpreter = open\_exec(elf\_interpreter);
retval = PTR\_ERR(interpreter);
if (IS\_ERR(interpreter))
goto out\_free\_interp;
retval = kernel\_read(interpreter, 0, bprm->buf, BINPRM\_BUF\_SIZE);
Discussion:
=============
1) The Linux man pages state that a read(2) can return less than the
requested number of bytes, even zero. It is not clear how this can
happen while reading a disk file (in contrast to network sockets),
however here some thoughts:
- if we trick read to fill the elf\_phdata buffer with less than size
bytes, the remaining part of the buffer will contain some garbage data,
that is data from the previous kernel object, which occupied that memory
area.
Therefore we could arbitrarily modify the memory layout of the binary
supplying a suitable header information in the kernel buffer. This
should be sufficient to gain control over the flow of execution for
most of the setuid binaries around.
- on Linux a disk read goes through the page cache. That is, a disk read
can easily fail on a page boundary due to a low memory condition. In
this case read will return less than the requested number of bytes but
still indicate success (ret>0).
- most of the standard setuid binaries on a 'normal' i386 Linux
installation have ELF headers stored below the 4096th byte, therefore
they are probably not exploitable on i386 architecture.
2) This bug can lead to a incorrectly mmaped binary image in the memory.
There are various reasons why a mmap() call can fail:
- a temporary low memory condition, so that the allocation of a new VMA
descriptor fails
- memory limit (RLIMIT\_AS) exceeded, which can be easily manipulated
before calling execve()
- file locks held for the binary file in question
Security implications in the case of a setuid binary are quite obvious:
we may end up with a binary without the .text or .bss section or with
those sections shifted (in the case they are not 'fixed' sections). It
is not clear which standard binaries are exploitable however it is
sufficient that at some point we come over some instructions that jump
into the environment area due to malformed memory layout and gain full
control over the setuid application.
3) This bug is similar to 2) however the code incorrectly returns the
kernel\_read status to the calling function on mmap failure which will
assume that the program interpreter has been loaded. That means that the
kernel will start the execution of the binary file itself instead of
calling the program interpreter (linker) that have to finish the binary
loading from user space.
We have found that standard Linux (i386, GCC 2.95) setuid binaries
contain code that will jump to the EIP=0 address and crash (since there
is no virtual memory mapped there), however this may vary from binary to
binary as well from architecture to architecture and may be easily
exploitable.
4) This bug leads to internal kernel file system functions beeing called
with an argument string exceeding the maximum path size in length
(PATH\_MAX). It is not clear if this condition is exploitable.
An user may try to execute such a malicious binary with an unterminated
interpreter name string and trick the kernel memory manager to return a
memory chunk for the elf\_interpreter variable followed by a suitable
longish path name (like ./././....). Our experiments show that it can
lead to a preceivable system hang.
5) This bug is similar to the shared file table race [1]. We give a
proof-of-concept code at the end of this article that just core dumps
the non-readable but executable ELF file.
An user may create a manipulated ELF binary that requests a non-readable
but executable file as program interpreter and gain read access to the
privileged binary. This works only if the file is a valid ELF image
file, so it is not possible to read a data file that has the execute bit
set but the read bit cleared. A common usage would be to read exec-only
setuid binaries to gain offsets for further exploitation.
Impact:
=======
Unprivileged users may gain elevated (root) privileges.
