Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A format string vulnerability exists in the way the Unreal Engine handles class names sent by clients to the server during connection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability lies in the handling of client-provided class names by the server.
- Specifically, the server does not properly sanitize or validate the class names received from clients.
- This lack of validation allows an attacker to inject format string specifiers (e.g., `%n`, `%s`, etc.) into the class name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
  - Server crashes (denial of service)
  - Remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack occurs remotely when a client connects to a server.
- An attacker needs to have access to the server, requiring password knowledge if protected.
- The attacker manipulates the class names sent to the server during connection to include format string specifiers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the game server.
- If the server is password protected, the attacker must know the password or find a way to bypass it.
- The attacker needs the ability to modify the data sent to the server in order to inject the malicious format string.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects numerous games based on the Unreal engine.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit was created using a proxy server to modify Unreal packets in real-time, demonstrating the vulnerability by crashing the server.
- The issue was reported to EpicGames in September 2003, but a quick fix was not released, being included in a later patch.
