Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is that IBM Lotus Notes/Domino fails to properly encode HTML code enclosed in square brackets (`[` and `]`) within computed fields. Instead of encoding the brackets and the HTML within them, the server sends this code "as is" to the browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By inserting malicious HTML and JavaScript within square brackets into computed fields, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of a user's browser.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** Lotus Notes/Domino lacks proper input validation for square brackets in computed fields, allowing the injection of unescaped HTML code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code on a user's browser.
- **Data Theft and Manipulation:** The injected JavaScript can potentially steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information, or modify the content of the displayed page.
- **Defacement:** An attacker could deface the appearance of the web page being served by the Lotus Notes/Domino server.
- **Phishing:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious sites.
- **Full Compromise:** In the worst case, an attacker might gain full access to a user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Computed fields:** The attacker injects malicious HTML and JavaScript within square brackets into various computed fields:
    - computed
    - computed for display
    - computed when composed
    - computed text element
- **Editable fields (secondary):** While the initial report stated it wouldn't work in editable fields, a later test showed that if the exploit is entered in an editable field, saved, and then the document is viewed in read mode, the exploit can be triggered. This is a more severe attack vector than initially reported.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to Lotus Notes/Domino:** The attacker must have access to an IBM Lotus Notes/Domino environment.
- **Ability to modify fields:** The attacker needs the ability to modify computed fields or editable fields to include their malicious code, likely through a user with write access to database objects such as the form or view in question.
- **Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker requires basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript to craft the malicious payload.
- **User interaction:** To execute the XSS, a user must view a document with the malicious code in one of the vulnerable fields.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was tested in R6, but believed to be present in prior versions of Lotus Notes/Domino that support computed fields.
- The provided example demonstrates the vulnerability by inserting a script tag within square brackets in a URL query parameter, simulating a computed field scenario.
- The recommended solution is to validate user input for square bracket characters in computed fields and avoid rendering them directly.
