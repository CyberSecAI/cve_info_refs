How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Introduction
2) Bugs
3) The Code
4) Fix

#######################################################################

===============
1) Introduction
===============

Hired Team is a nice FPS game developed by New Media Generation
(<http://eng.nmg.ru>) and released at the end of the year 2000.
It seems to be the only game based on the Shine engine (created by the
same developers) so I cannot compare the bugs found in this game with
other games created with the same engine to know their "real nature"
and if the engine has been modified from the 2001 till now.

#######################################################################

=======
2) Bugs
=======

------------------------
A] in-game format string
------------------------

The game is affected by a format string bug located in the game
console. That lets an attacker to join a server (that doesn't have
password support, so anyone can enter in it) and crash it or execute
malicious code simply sending a message containing the formatted
arguments (like the classical %n%n%n).

----------------------------------------------
B] match interruption through malformed packet
----------------------------------------------

Each time a new player joins, the server assigns an UDP port to him
(usually the sequential ports after the server's one, by default
29199).
If the server receives a packet containing unexpected data to one of
these data ports, the match will be interrupted immediately.

---------------------------
C] status and kick problems
---------------------------

During the testing of this game/engine I found also that if a client
uses the status command, the server crash immediately.
The other strange thing is that any player can kick the others (admin
included) without limits.

#######################################################################

===========
3) The Code
===========

------------------------
A] in-game format string
------------------------

Launch a server and a client, join the server and use the console by
pressing the ~ key. Then type:

  say %n%n%n

the server will crash immediately. A more simple and fast test is the
following: launch the game, select Console from the main menu and type
%x. You will see a message like: Unknown command "1015c888"

----------------------------------------------
B] match interruption through malformed packet
----------------------------------------------

Send a packet to the UDP port 29200 of the server (or 29220 if you are
testing the demo, it is the data port usually assigned to the admin)
containing any data you want, like hello, asdf or any other type of
data.

---------------------------
C] status and kick problems
---------------------------

When you (client) are into the server, from the console type:

  status

to crash the server or

  kick NAME

where NAME is the name of the player you want to kick.

#######################################################################

======
4) Fix
======

No fix.
The vendor has not replied to my mails. Probably the Shine engine and
Hired Team: Trial are no longer supported.
