Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `btdownload.php` script in Blogtorrent not sanitizing user-supplied input, specifically the `file` parameter within the GET request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The script directly uses the user-provided `file` parameter in a `file_get_contents()` function without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to use path traversal sequences like `../` to access files outside of the intended `torrents` directory.
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Due to the lack of sanitization, an attacker can read arbitrary files on the server that the webserver user has permissions to access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, user data, or source code. The example given is to retrieve the `/etc/passwd` file.
*   **System Compromise:** If an attacker is able to retrieve config files containing sensitive information, it may lead to further exploitation of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `btdownload.php` script, including a `file` parameter with path traversal characters and the target file to be accessed.
*   **Network Based:** The attacker only needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable `btdownload.php` to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server running Blogtorrent.
*   **Understanding of the application:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the `btdownload.php` script and how it handles the `file` parameter.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix for the vulnerability was quickly committed to the CVS repository and involves a patch to the `btdownload.php` file.
*   The vulnerability was found in a "preview" release, but was disclosed due to the wide interest in the software, as reported by the author.

This vulnerability information aligns with the typical description of CVE-2004-1212.
