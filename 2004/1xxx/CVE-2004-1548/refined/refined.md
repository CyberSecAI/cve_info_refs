      "cve": "CVE-2004-1548",
      "details": "Multiple vulnerabilities in ActivePost Standard <= 3.1:\n\n*   **File-Server Crash**: The file server running on port 6004 crashes when provided with a filename longer than 4074 characters. This is due to a lack of proper bounds checking in the file server protocol, which processes data in 4104-byte blocks.\n*   **File-Server Directory Traversal and Path Disclosure**: A directory traversal vulnerability allows an attacker to upload files to arbitrary locations on the server's disk by using slash characters in the filename (e.g., /../../../windows/calc.exe). Additionally, the server discloses the full path where the file is written after each upload.\n*   **Conference Password Disclosure**: The server sends information about available conference rooms, including the plain text passwords of protected rooms, whenever a user enters the conference menu.",
      "vulnerability": "File-server crash, directory traversal, and conference password disclosure",
      "impact": "File server crash leading to denial of service, arbitrary file upload and overwrite on the server's disk, disclosure of conference passwords.",
      "attack_vector": "Remote, through the server's file upload functionality and conference system.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to send specially crafted data to the server to trigger the vulnerabilities. No authentication required to trigger file-server crash and directory traversal. The conference password disclosure vulnerability is triggered when client attempts to access conference information",
      "affected_versions": "<= 3.1",
        "root_cause": "Lack of proper input validation on filename length, insufficient path sanitization, and insecure conference information transmission"
