===========================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-4-1             October 27, 2004
Standard C library script vulnerabilities
CAN-2004-0968
===========================================================

A security issue affects the following Ubuntu releases:

Ubuntu 4.10 (Warty Warthog)

The following packages are affected:

libc6

The problem can be corrected by upgrading the affected package to
version 2.3.2.ds1-13ubuntu2.2. In general, a standard system upgrade
is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.

Details follow:

Recently, Trustix Secure Linux discovered some vulnerabilities in the
libc6 package. The utilities "catchsegv" and "glibcbug" created
temporary files in an insecure way, which allowed a symlink attack to
create or overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user
invoking the program.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : glibc
Vulnerability  : insecure temporary files
Problem-Type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0968
BugTraq ID     : 11286
Debian Bug     : 279680 278278 205600

Several insecure uses of temporary files have been discovered in
support scripts in the libc6 package which provices the c library for
a GNU/Linux system.  Trustix developers found that the catchsegv
script uses temporary files insecurely.  Openwall developers
discovered insecure temporary files in the glibcbug script.  These
scripts are vulnerable to a symlink attack.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.5-11.8.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.3.2.ds1-20.

We recommend that you upgrade your libc6 package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
