Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described, which are related to CVE-2004-1547:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **File Server Crash (A):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The file server crashes due to a buffer overflow vulnerability when handling filenames longer than 4074 characters.
    *   **Weakness:**  Lack of proper input validation and boundary checks on the filename length.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, making the file server unavailable.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted file upload request with an overly long filename to the file server on port 6004.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker, no special privileges needed.

*   **File Server Directory Traversal and Path Disclosure (B):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Directory traversal vulnerability in the file upload functionality, combined with the server disclosing the full path where files are stored.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper sanitization of the filename, allowing characters like "/" to be used for traversing directories.  Server also reveals full file path after upload
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary file upload/overwrite anywhere on the server's disk.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted file upload request that contains directory traversal sequences in the filename, e.g., `/../../../windows/calc.exe`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker, no special privileges needed.

*   **Conference Password Disclosure (C):**
    *  **Root Cause:** The server sends plain text conference room passwords to clients.
    *   **Weakness:**  Lack of encryption or proper handling of sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to conference rooms.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Passive eavesdropping on the network traffic between the client and server when the user enters the conference menu.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Attacker needs to be able to sniff the network traffic between the client and server.
