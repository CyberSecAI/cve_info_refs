The provided content describes an information disclosure vulnerability in the 3COM Wireless router (3CRADSL72).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The router's web interface exposes sensitive information via the `/app_sta.stm` page without requiring any authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Lack of Authentication:** The primary weakness is the absence of authentication requirements to access the `/app_sta.stm` page.
-   **Information Disclosure:** The page reveals sensitive information like username, password (used to connect to the internet, not the router itself), primary and secondary DNS server addresses, and default gateway.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Exposure of Credentials:** Attackers can obtain the user's internet connection password, allowing them to potentially impersonate the user or disrupt their internet service.
-   **Network Information Leakage:** Exposure of DNS servers and default gateway can aid further attacks, like DNS spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
-   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router or have the ability to access the router's web interface, e.g., through the internet if remote administration is enabled and not properly protected.
-   **HTTP Request:** The attacker simply sends an HTTP GET request to the `/app_sta.stm` page of the router's IP address.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker needs network connectivity to the router. No prior authentication or special privileges are needed.
