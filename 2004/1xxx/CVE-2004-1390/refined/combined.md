QNX is used in many different devices and industries, including, but not limited to     + routers + manufacturing and processing + medical equipment + automotive and transportation + military and aerospace + consumer electronics + industry automation and control  The pppoed command is used to start the PPPoEd daemon which provides Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) connections on QNX systems. The syntax of the PPPoEd command is pppoed [options] [suboptions] where [options] are user-supplied command-line parameters. A lack of bounds checking on the user-supplied options may allow a buffer overflow to occur.
