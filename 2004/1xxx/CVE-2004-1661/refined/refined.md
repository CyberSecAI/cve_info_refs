Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The MailWorks Professional application has a weak session check mechanism that relies solely on the presence and values of cookies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The application improperly validates user sessions based on cookie values. Specifically, the `auth` and `uId` cookies.
*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application trusts the `auth` cookie's value (`auth=1`) to indicate a logged-in state and the `uId` cookie to define the user ID, without proper server-side validation or authentication checks.
*   **Lack of Session Management:**  The application lacks proper session management practices, making it vulnerable to session hijacking via cookie manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Administrative Access:** An attacker can gain full administrative control over the application by simply setting the `auth` cookie to 1 and `uId` to the ID of the admin user (typically `uId=1`).
*   **Admin User Spoofing:** The attacker can spoof the admin user functions, allowing them to perform actions as if they were the administrator.
*   **Unauthorized User Creation:** The attacker can create new admin accounts.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Once authenticated as admin, an attacker can manipulate user data, mailing lists, and other critical aspects of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is through crafting HTTP requests with manipulated `Cookie` headers. Specifically, setting the `auth` and `uId` cookies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable MailWorks Professional application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP and the ability to manipulate cookie values within HTTP requests.
*   **No Prior Authentication Required:**  The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the login process completely and directly access the admin interface.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was easily exploited by setting the `auth` cookie to 1 and the `uId` cookie to the admin's ID (usually 1).
*   The vendor was notified and released a patch for all customers.
*   The exploit allows for more advanced attacks such as creating admin users or spoofing the admin account.
