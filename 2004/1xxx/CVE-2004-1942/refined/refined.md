Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security issue introduced by Solaris 9 patch 113579-03:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The patch 113579-03 for Solaris 9 incorrectly handles secure NIS maps, causing them to be treated as non-secure. This means the intended access restrictions on these maps are bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to enforce the security settings on NIS maps. Secure maps, which are intended to restrict access to sensitive data, are made accessible to unauthorized users due to the faulty patch.
-   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Specifically, the vulnerability allows any user on a NIS client to read the contents of secure maps, such as `passwd.adjunct.byname`, which may contain encrypted passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Confidentiality Breach:**  The most significant impact is the exposure of sensitive data stored in secure NIS maps. The extraction of encrypted passwords can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts.
-   **Compromise of Security Measures:** The vulnerability defeats the purpose of using secure NIS maps, which are a component of security configurations like "c2secure".

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network Access:**  The attack vector is through the NIS network protocol. A user on a NIS client machine can exploit this vulnerability to read the contents of secure maps on the NIS server.
-   **Utility Exploitation:** The attacker can leverage standard utilities such as `ypcat(1)` and `ypmatch(1)` to retrieve the contents of secure maps.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **NIS Client Access:** The attacker needs to be a user on a machine that is configured as a NIS client to a vulnerable Solaris 9 server.
-   **Basic User Privileges:** No elevated privileges (e.g., root or super-user access) are required on the client machine to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The patch 113579-03 replaces `/var/yp/Makefile`. Removing the patch will revert this file to the previous version.
-   The issue has been confirmed by Sun.
-   Patch 113579-04, which was pre-applied in Solaris 9 4/04, is suspected to have the same issue but was not tested.
