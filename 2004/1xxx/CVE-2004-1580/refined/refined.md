Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation of the `cat_id` parameter in the `index.php` file of CubeCart 2.0.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `cat_id` parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** By providing a single quote (') as the value of the `cat_id` parameter, the application reveals the full server-side installation path through MySQL error messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to bypass authentication, access sensitive database information (including usernames and passwords as demonstrated in the exploit), modify data, or potentially gain control over the database server.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The full path disclosure can aid attackers in planning further attacks by providing information about the server's directory structure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to `index.php` by manipulating the `cat_id` parameter
   (e.g. `http://www.exemple.com/cart/index.php?cat_id=19'`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application (i.e., a remote attacker).
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in CubeCart version 2.0.1.
*   The exploit details provide specific examples of how to trigger the vulnerability, including a demonstration of extracting admin usernames and passwords by using `UNION SELECT` in the query.
*   The issue was reported to the vendor, and a fix was said to be available soon.
* The exploit-db entry lists the vulnerable string as `'`, further clarifying the injection point.
