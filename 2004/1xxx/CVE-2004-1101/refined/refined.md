Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in MailPost. Specifically, when a trailing slash (`/`) is appended to an executable filename in a request, the application fails to handle this gracefully.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly filter or sanitize user-supplied input (the file path) before using it in the application's logic. This allows for the injection of potentially malicious characters. The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which occurs because the application reflects user input back to the client without proper encoding or escaping.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting:** By injecting malicious script via a URL with trailing `/`, an attacker can inject malicious code into the context of the vulnerable site.
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** This malicious code can be used to steal sensitive information, including passwords, credit card numbers, and cookies, or any arbitrary data the user inputs. The application reveals the webroot path of the server in the error information.
    *   **Malicious Content Presentation:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to present malicious content to site visitors.
*  **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL sent to the vulnerable application. Appending a trailing slash (`/`) to the executable filename causes the application to return an error message that includes the attacker's input and potentially revealing the web root path. The vulnerability is triggered when a user requests a specially crafted URL.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to get the target user to make a request to the server with a crafted URL that includes the trailing slash on the executable name. This could be via a link in an email, a malicious website, or a compromised page.
*   **Software Affected**: MailPost version 5.1.1sv and potentially earlier versions

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by ProCheckUp.
*   The CERT/CC is not aware of a practical solution at the time of the report, but it suggests configuring error pages to mitigate the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is identified as VU#596046, and does not have a CVE assigned.
*   The vendor of MailPost was notified but had not provided a statement at the time of the report.
*   The severity is rated at 13.50.
