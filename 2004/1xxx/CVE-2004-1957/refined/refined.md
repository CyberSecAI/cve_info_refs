The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in PostNuke 0.726 Phoenix. Here's a breakdown:

**A. Full Path Disclosure:**

*   **Root Cause:**  Various scripts and modules within the PostNuke installation are directly accessible via HTTP requests without proper access control. When these files are accessed directly, they generate PHP errors that reveal the server's full file system paths.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of access control and improper error handling.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of the full server paths, which can aid attackers in further exploitation attempts.
*   **Attack Vector:** Direct HTTP requests to vulnerable files.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable PostNuke installation.

    *   **Specific examples include:**
        *   `includes/blocks/` directory (A1)
        *   `pnadodb` directory (A2)
        *   `NS-NewUser` module (A3)
        *   `NS-Your_Account` module (A4)
        *   `NS-LostPassword` module (A5)
        *   `NS-Multisites` module (A6)
        *   `NS-User` module (A7)

**B. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   **Root Cause:** Unsanitized user inputs are reflected in the application's output, allowing injection of malicious scripts. Note that this requires that 'special anti-filtering measures' are not in place, which suggests that some protection against XSS may have been implemented.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of input sanitization and output encoding.
*   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, leading to potential session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** Crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript payloads.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Ability to send crafted links to PostNuke users.

    *   **Specific Examples include:**
        *   `Downloads` module (B1)
        *   `Web_Links` module (B2)
        *   `openwindow.php` script (B3)
