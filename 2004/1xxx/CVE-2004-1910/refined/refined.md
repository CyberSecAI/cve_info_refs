Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `GetPrivateProfileString` function of the `Symantec.SymVAFileQuery.1` COM object, which is part of the Symantec Virus Detection ActiveX control.

**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `GetPrivateProfileString` function doesn't properly validate the length of the input `bstrKey` parameter, allowing an attacker to provide an overly long string which overwrites memory on the stack leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By providing a specially crafted long string as the `bstrKey` parameter, an attacker can overwrite the stack and execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- **Process Crash:** Even if arbitrary code execution is not achieved, supplying a large amount of data can cause the browser process to crash, particularly if the Symantec Security Check has recently been run.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via a web browser.
- **ActiveX Control:**  The vulnerable code is within an ActiveX control (`rufsi.dll`), which can be instantiated and interacted with from a web page using scripting languages like VBScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page or control a web page visited by a user with the vulnerable Symantec Virus Detection ActiveX installed.
- The attacker needs to be able to create and call the vulnerable ActiveX object from the web page.
- The attacker must be able to pass a very large string to the `GetPrivateProfileString` function.

**Additional Notes:**
- The proof-of-concept code provided demonstrates how to trigger the buffer overflow using a long string of "a" characters.
- Symantec initially claimed that there was no buffer overflow and no remote code execution issue, but later acknowledged a process crash issue.

This vulnerability has the potential for high-impact exploitation, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's system remotely.
