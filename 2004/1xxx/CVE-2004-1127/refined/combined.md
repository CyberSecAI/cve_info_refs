| [Description](#c0)  Michael Best    2002-08-29 17:10:07 UTC  ``` Tested on   GCC 3.1.1, GCC 3.2 Pentium, Pentium MMX, K6  The kernel will compile correctly with GCC 2.95.4  The test program was compiled with: gcc -g -O2 -pipe odirect.c -o odirect  And requires a partition with 512M+ of free space.  This apparently does not affect all kernels, but does affect the Vanilla kernel, and the XFS CVS Kernel.  The gentoo-2.4.19-r7 kernel did not seems to be affected on my machine, which may be due to some patching of O_DIRECT in the -aa or other kernel trees. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Michael Best    2002-08-29 17:11:02 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 3544](attachment.cgi?id=3544 "odirect.c") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=3544&action=edit "odirect.c")] odirect.c ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Michael Best    2002-08-29 20:31:51 UTC  ``` This affects XFS, ext3 and all other kernel systems using O_DIRECT.  XFS is hit particularly bad because of the it's xfs_fsr defragmentation utility. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Brandon Low (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-09-06 18:26:25 UTC  ``` hrm... can you check this out with xfs-sources-2.4.19-r1 and gentoo-sources-2.4.19-r9 please? ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Michael Best    2002-09-09 00:02:40 UTC  ``` O_DIRECT definiately doesn't work with the 3.2 GCC compiled xfs-sources-2.4.19-r1 kernel.  The gentoo-sources-2.4.19-r9 doesn't contain XFS support which is required for my i586 Box.  ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Brandon Low (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-10-21 18:21:38 UTC  ``` IIRC the fixes for O_DIRECT have been merged into mainstream from -ac now...  next kernel should fixor this. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Andrew Baudouin    2003-02-15 23:13:11 UTC  ``` Works fine here on   root@azeroth andrew # cat /proc/version Linux version 2.4.20-pre10-mjc2 (root@cdimage) (gcc version 3.2.1) #1 Sat Jan 18 15:24:34 CST 2003  P5/166Mhz MMX machine running ReiserFS.     ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Jay Pfeifer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2003-04-15 18:15:08 UTC  ``` this appears to be fixed in the 2.4.20 based xfs-sources/gentoo-sources.    closing.

Vendor's Description:

"An Open Source Linux/Unix version of the hub software for Direct
Connect."

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

------------
2. The bug:
------------

The program doesn't correctly manage the $RedirectAll command.
In fact it will have a buffer overflow, letting an attacker to execute
arbitrary code on the victim system.

NOTE: To exploit the bug the attacker needs to have admin privilege on
the victim hub.

4. The fix:
------------

No fix.
The vendor has not not replied to my mails.

In the meantime give admin access only to trusted people.
If you want you can use my following little patch that should fix this
bug:

# Open DC Hub: Remote code execution — GLSA **200411-37**
