Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Software:** Password Protect by Web Animations
*   **Vulnerability Types:**
    *   SQL Injection
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `admin`, `Pass`, `LoginId`, and `OPass` variables are vulnerable.
*  **XSS:** The application does not filter HTML code from user-supplied input in the `ShowMsg` variable, allowing for XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Vulnerable scripts: `index_next.asp`, `ChangePassword.asp`, `users_edit.asp`, and `users_add.asp`
    *   Vulnerable parameters: `admin`, `Pass`, `LoginId`, and `OPass`
*   **XSS:**
    *   Vulnerable scripts: `index.asp`, `ChangePassword.asp`, `users_list.asp`, and `users_add.asp`, `users_edit.asp`
    *   Vulnerable parameter: `ShowMsg`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   A remote attacker can log in as an administrator without proper credentials.
    *   An attacker could manipulate or extract data from the database.
*   **XSS:**
    *   An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browsers of other users accessing the vulnerable pages. This can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** By crafting malicious SQL queries through URL parameters such as `admin`, `Pass`, `LoginId`, and `OPass`.
*   **XSS:** By injecting malicious HTML/JavaScript code via the `ShowMsg` URL parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application (remote attacker).
*   For SQL injection, no prior authentication may be required if the injection point allows authentication bypass.
*   For XSS, the attacker must be able to craft and submit malicious URLs.
