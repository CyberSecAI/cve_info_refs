- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient filtering of user-supplied input when submitting a blog name. Specifically, the blog name is not sanitized before being used in the blog's title.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially hijack a user's session by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the blog title.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker submits a crafted blog name containing malicious JavaScript code (e.g., `<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>`) via the administration panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have superuser privileges to access the administration panel where the blog name can be modified.
