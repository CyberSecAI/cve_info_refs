{
  "CVE-2004-1384": {
    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpGroupWare that could lead to information disclosure or remote compromise.",
    "Root cause": "The phpGroupWare application contains vulnerabilities related to path disclosure, cross-site scripting (XSS), and SQL injection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Path Disclosure: Full path disclosure is possible by appending junk characters to session IDs or by providing invalid parameters in the URL, revealing the web directory's physical path.",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Multiple instances of XSS vulnerabilities exist in various phpGroupWare components, allowing injection of arbitrary client-side code.",
      "SQL Injection: Several SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in multiple parts of the application, with some being more severe, allowing for direct influence on SQL queries."
    ],
    "Impact": "These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks, execute SQL queries, and disclose the full path of the web directory.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Path disclosure can be triggered by manipulating URL parameters.",
      "XSS can be triggered by injecting malicious scripts through crafted URL parameters.",
      "SQL injection can be performed by crafting malicious SQL queries through manipulated URL parameters."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker can exploit the described vulnerabilities by sending malicious HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is required in order to trigger these issues."
