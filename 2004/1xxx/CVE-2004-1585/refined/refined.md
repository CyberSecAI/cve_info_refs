- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The server crashes due to its inability to properly handle certain wide characters (16-bit) in network data exchanged with clients.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Server crash vulnerability due to improper handling of wide characters.
    - Inability to effectively terminate client connections through server-issued shutdown commands. Clients can ignore the command and remain connected.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Remote attackers can crash the server by sending crafted messages containing specific wide characters.
    - Attackers can maintain client connections even after being issued shutdown commands, potentially allowing them to persist in chat sessions.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, sending specially crafted messages to the server
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be able to send network data to the server.
    - No authentication or authorization is mentioned, suggesting any client might be able to trigger it.
