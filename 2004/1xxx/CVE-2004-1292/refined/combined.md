# Ringtone Tools: Buffer overflow vulnerability — GLSA **200503-18**

The Ringtone Tools utilities contain a buffer overflow vulnerability,
potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-mobilephone/ringtonetools** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.23** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.23** |

### Background

Ringtone Tools is a program for creating ringtones and logos for
mobile phones.

### Description

Qiao Zhang has discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
'parse\_emelody' function in 'parse\_emelody.c'.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a Ringtone Tools user to open a
specially crafted eMelody file, which would potentially lead to the
execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the
application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Ringtone Tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-mobilephone/ringtonetools-2.23"
```
