The provided content describes vulnerabilities in Member Management System 2.1, which includes SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Lack of proper input sanitization in multiple scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** Improper handling of user-supplied input in `resend.asp` and `news_view.asp` allows for SQL injection. The issue is also present in administration site scripts.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Lack of sanitization in the `register.asp` form allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that will be executed on the admin site. Additionally, `error.asp` is vulnerable to XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:**
    - Disclosure of authentication information.
    - Disclosure of user information.
    - Modification of user and admin information.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    - Execution of arbitrary code via network in the admin site.
    - Modification or deletion of data in the admin site, including user deletion.
    - User access via network.

**Attack vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:**  By injecting SQL code through the `ID` parameter of URLs such as `http://[host]/resend.asp?ID=[SQL query]` and `http://[host]/news_view.asp?ID=[SQL query]`.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting XSS code through the `register.asp` form or through the `err` parameter of the URL, such as `http://[host]/error.asp?err=">[XSS]`.  The XSS vulnerability in register.asp can be leveraged with an iframe to perform actions such as user deletion through `http://[host]/admin/user_del.asp?ID=[ID to delete]`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameters.
- For XSS, they need a way to trigger the malicious script on the admin's browser.
