- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Sending a large, specially crafted buffer to the MSSQL server causes a denial-of-service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The server fails to properly handle a large input buffer with specific data, leading to an unhandled exception.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The MSSQL server becomes unresponsive, causing a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a large TCP packet to the MSSQL server with the specific crafted data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the MSSQL server and the ability to send TCP packets.
