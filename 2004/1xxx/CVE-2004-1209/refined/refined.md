Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure default configuration of Payflow Link, where the "AMOUNT" hidden field is not validated against any accepted value. Additionally, there is no verification of the source of the POST request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Hidden Field Manipulation:** The "AMOUNT" hidden field can be modified by an attacker before being submitted to the secure PayFlow Link webpage.
2.  **Lack of Source Verification:**  There is no check to ensure the POST request originates from an authorized source (e.g., the legitimate merchant's website).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can manipulate the "AMOUNT" field to an arbitrary value, causing misrepresentation of purchase amounts. This can result in the merchant receiving less payment than expected for their products/services.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker can craft a malicious HTML form that submits a modified "AMOUNT" value to the Payflow Link page. This form can be hosted anywhere since there is no source verification.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to create and host a webpage that can submit form data to the Payflow Link endpoint. No special access to the merchant's system is needed.

**Additional Details**
The advisory mentions a feature called "Accepted URL" which, when configured, can mitigate the vulnerability. This feature validates the origin of the request. However, it's not enabled by default and not included in the default HTML setup, leaving the vulnerability open in default configurations. The provided solution is to configure the Accepted URLs feature in the Verisign manager.
