Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2004-1316 (although the isec.pl content states it was not assigned, the Mozilla advisory does reference this CVE).

**Root Cause:** A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `MSG_UnEscapeSearchUrl` function within the Mozilla browser's NNTP handling code. This function is responsible for processing escaped characters in NNTP URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Heap Overflow:** The core issue is that the `MSG_UnEscapeSearchUrl` function does not properly handle a backslash character (`\`) at the end of the input string. Specifically, the code reads two subsequent hex characters following the backslash without checking if they exist, leading to a buffer overflow.
* **Lack of Input Validation:** The function does not validate the input `commandSpecificData`, allowing it to process an arbitrary number of characters, including the backslash at the end.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker could exploit the heap overflow vulnerability to overwrite memory with malicious code. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the client machine, giving the attacker control of the affected system.
* **Crash:** The proof of concept code crashes the browser, demonstrating the potential for denial of service.
* **Heap Corruption:** The overflow leads to heap corruption that will most likely cause a crash or unexpected behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **NNTP URLs:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing specifically crafted `news://` URLs.
* **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a malicious URL to a vulnerable client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Remote Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted `news://` URLs to a target user using a vulnerable version of the Mozilla Suite or Thunderbird. This can be done through a website, email, or any other means of delivering a URL.
* **Vulnerable Software:** The user must be using a vulnerable version of Mozilla Suite (<= 1.7.3) or Thunderbird (<= 0.8). Firefox is not vulnerable as it doesn't handle the `news://` scheme.

**Additional Technical Details**

The problematic code snippet from `nsNNTPProtocol.cpp` is:
```cpp
char *MSG_UnEscapeSearchUrl (const char *commandSpecificData)
{
  char *result = (char*) PR_Malloc (PL_strlen(commandSpecificData) + 1);
  if (result)
  {
    char *resultPtr = result;
    while (1)
    {
      char ch = *commandSpecificData++;
      if (!ch)
        break;
      if (ch == '\\')
      {
        char scratchBuf[3];
        scratchBuf[0] = (char) *commandSpecificData++;
        scratchBuf[1] = (char) *commandSpecificData++;
        scratchBuf[2] = '\0';
        int accum = 0;
        PR_sscanf(scratchBuf, "%X", &accum);
        *resultPtr++ = (char) accum;
      }
      else
        *resultPtr++ = ch;
    }
    *resultPtr = '\0';
  }
  return result;
}
```
The vulnerability lies in the loop between lines 334 and 351. When the last character of the commandSpecificData is a backslash '\\', `commandSpecificData++` will increment the pointer beyond the end of the string in line 341 and 343, causing a read beyond the buffer in these lines. As a result, the function can overwrite the heap buffer allocated for the result.

The vulnerability report from isec.pl clarifies that despite the initial claim from a Mozilla developer that it was not exploitable, the reporter demonstrated that the vulnerability is indeed exploitable with attacker-controlled data, thus warranting a public disclosure.
