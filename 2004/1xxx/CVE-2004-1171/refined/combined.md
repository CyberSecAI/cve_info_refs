KDE Security Advisory: plain text password exposure
Original Release Date: 2004-12-09
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20041209-1.txt
0. References
http://www.sec-consult.com/index.php?id=118
1. Systems affected:
All KDE 3.2.x releases, KDE 3.3.0, KDE 3.3.1 and KDE 3.3.2.
2. Overview:
Daniel Fabian notified the KDE security team about a possible
privacy issue in KDE. When creating a link to a remote file
from various applications including Konqueror, the resulting
URL may contain the authentication credentials used to access
that remote resource. This includes, but is not limited to
browsing SMB ("Samba") shares. Further investigation revealed
unnecessary exposure of authentication credentials by the
SMB ("Samba") protocol handler.
The link reference file, which is a file with the extension
".desktop", is a plain text configuration file that is created
with default access permissions, depending on the users' umask
this could include world read permission. Usually the URL saved
in this .desktop file only contains the password if the user
manually entered it this way. The SMB protocol handler however
unnecessarily exposes authentication credentials by always
including this information in the URL that it generates.
The KDE team provides patches which will unconditionally
remove the password from the authentication credentials
before creating the link reference file and that fix the SMB
protocol handler to not unnecessarily include passwords
in URLs Authentication credentials can then be stored in
KWallet instead.
3. Impact:
A user may inadvertly expose passwords provided for SMB shares
or other passwords that were entered as part of an URL.
4. Solution:
Users should verify that links to remote files do not contain
password information by right-clicking the link and selecting
the "Properties" option and then selecting the "URL" tab.
The KDE 3.3.2 release contains most fixes already, therefore
the patch set to apply to KDE 3.3.2 is less than for other
KDE versions.
Source code patches have been made available which fix these
vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.
5. Patch:

# kdelibs, kdebase: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200412-16**

kdelibs and kdebase contain a flaw allowing password disclosure when
creating a link to a remote file. Furthermore Konqueror is vulnerable to
window injection.

### Affected packages

| Package | **kde-base/kdelibs** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.3.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **3.2.3-r4**revision >= **3.3.1-r2**>= **3.3.2-r1** |

| Package | **kde-base/kdebase** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.3.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **3.2.3-r3**revision >= **3.3.1-r2** |

### Background

KDE is a feature-rich graphical desktop environment for Linux and
Unix-like Operating Systems. The KDE core libraries (kdebase and
kdelibs) provide native support for many protocols. Konqueror is the
KDE web browser and filemanager.

### Description

Daniel Fabian discovered that the KDE core libraries contain a
flaw allowing password disclosure by making a link to a remote file.
When creating this link, the resulting URL contains authentication
credentials used to access the remote file (CAN 2004-1171).

The Konqueror webbrowser allows websites to load webpages into a window
or tab currently used by another website (CAN-2004-1158).

### Impact

A malicious user could have access to the authentication
credentials of other users depending on the file permissions.

A malicious website could use the window injection vulnerability to
load content in a window apparently belonging to another website.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All kdelibs users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kdelibs-3.2.3-r4"
```

All kdebase users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kdebase-3.2.3-r3"
```

Date: Nov. 29, 2004
Author: Daniel Fabian
Product: KDE, Konquerer
Vendor: KDE e. V. (<http://www.kde.org>)
Vendor-Status: vendor contacted
Vendor-Patches: none available so far
Attack Vector: Local

~~~~~~~~
Synopsis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The KDE program Konquerer allows for browsing SMB shares comfortably
through the GUI. By placing a shortcut to an SMB share on KDE's
desktop, an attacker can disclose his victim's password in
plaintext.

~~~~~~~~
Affected Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The problem has been successfully reproduced with KDE 3.2.1 on a
standard SuSE 9.1 distribution. I have not been able to reproduce
the issue on a KDE 3.3.0, however the developers of KDE claimed
that there might be a related issue in both KDE 3.3 as well as the
upcoming KDE 3.4.

~~~~~~~~
Vendor Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The vendor has been notified and was very cooperative. We set a
coordinated disclosure date to Nov. 10th. However Nov. 10th passed,
without a patch available. My mail for a new date has gone
unanswered for more than two weeks now, so I suppose it is ok to
release this advisory, very much so since this is not an issue that
can be widely exploited anyway.

~~~~~~~~
Vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Opening the URL "smb:/" in Konquerer allows KDE users to browse the
local network for SMB shares. Upon selecting a computer, the user
has to enter a password, if access to that computer is resticted.
While the URL of the SMB share correctly does not show the password
in Konqueror's address bar, this can be easily bypassed by copying
a shortcut to a certain share to the desktop.

The created desktop icon will be given a name (and address) following
this scheme:

smb://domain\username:password@server\sharename

The password can be read in plaintext by an attacker. So while a
colleague is getting some coffee or having a short nap at
his desk, it is most easy to get the password of his open
SMB shares.

~~~~~~~~
Timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oct. 06: Discovery of the vulnerability
Oct. 10: Initial vendor reply
Nov. 10: Planed coordinated disclosure
Nov. 29: Final disclosure

~~~~~~~~
Counter Measures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Until a patch is available, just lock your computer every time
you leave it (should be done regardless of this issue).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

KDE Security Advisory: plain text password exposure
Original Release Date: 2004-12-09
URL: <http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20041209-1.txt>

0. References

        <http://www.sec-consult.com/index.php?id=118>

1. Systems affected:

        All KDE 3.2.x releases, KDE 3.3.0, KDE 3.3.1 and KDE 3.3.2.

2. Overview:

        Daniel Fabian notified the KDE security team about a possible
        privacy issue in KDE. When creating a link to a remote file
        from various applications including Konqueror, the resulting
        URL may contain the authentication credentials used to access
        that remote resource. This includes, but is not limited to
        browsing SMB ("Samba") shares. Further investigation revealed
        unnecessary exposure of authentication credentials by the
        SMB ("Samba") protocol handler.

        The link reference file, which is a file with the extension
        ".desktop", is a plain text configuration file that is created
        with default access permissions, depending on the users' umask
        this could include world read permission. Usually the URL saved
        in this .desktop file only contains the password if the user
        manually entered it this way. The SMB protocol handler however
        unnecessarily exposes authentication credentials by always
        including this information in the URL that it generates.

        The KDE team provides patches which will unconditionally
        remove the password from the authentication credentials
        before creating the link reference file and that fix the SMB
        protocol handler to not unnecessarily include passwords
        in URLs Authentication credentials can then be stored in
        KWallet instead.

3. Impact:

        A user may inadvertly expose passwords provided for SMB shares
        or other passwords that were entered as part of an URL.

4. Solution:

        Users should verify that links to remote files do not contain
        password information by right-clicking the link and selecting
        the "Properties" option and then selecting the "URL" tab.

        The KDE 3.3.2 release contains most fixes already, therefore
        the patch set to apply to KDE 3.3.2 is less than for other
        KDE versions.

        Source code patches have been made available which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.

5. Patch:

        Patches for KDE 3.3.1 are available from
        ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security_patches :

## Shortcuts may insecurely store SMB authentication information

#### Vulnerability Note VU#305294

Original Release Date: 2004-12-13 | Last Revised: 2005-03-17

---

### Overview

SMB authentication information may be stored as plain text within URI shortcuts. As a result, a local attacker may be able read the authentication information and gain access to the share.

### Description

| SMB is a protocol for sharing data and resources between computers. Many operating systems support accessing SMB shares via URIs of the form:   smb://domain\&#xsername:password@server\sharename  If a shortcut to a protected SMB share is created, the URI (including the password section) will be stored as plain text within the shortcut. If an attacker can access the properties of the shortcut, they will be able to read the password and may be able to gain access to the protected share. According to reports, this vulnerability affects the [KDE Desktop Environment](http://www.kde.org/). However, other applications or operating systems may be affected as well. |
| --- |

### Impact

| If a local attacker can create (or persuade a user to create) a shortcut to a protected SMB share and then gain access to that shortcut's properties, they will be able to read the SMB share's authentication information and consequently, gain access to the protected SMB share. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Lock Computer**  Users are encouraged to lock their computers when they step away from them. |
