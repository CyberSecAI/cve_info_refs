Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-1171:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way KDE's SMB protocol handler creates shortcuts (desktop files with the `.desktop` extension) to remote SMB shares. The handler was unnecessarily including the authentication credentials (username and password) in plain text within the URL stored in the `.desktop` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage of Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of SMB login credentials in clear text within the `.desktop` file.
- **Unnecessary Inclusion of Credentials:** The SMB protocol handler was designed to include credentials in the generated URL, even when not explicitly required.
- **Inadequate File Permissions:** The `.desktop` files were created with default access permissions, which, depending on the user's `umask`, could potentially grant world-readable permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Password Disclosure:** An attacker with access to the `.desktop` file could easily read the SMB password in plain text.
- **Unauthorized Access:** By obtaining the password, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the protected SMB share.
- **Local Privilege Escalation (Potential):** Although not a direct privilege escalation, a local attacker could use this vulnerability to access shares they might not otherwise have access to, effectively gaining elevated access to shared resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local access to a user's machine.
- **Shortcut Manipulation:** An attacker could either create a malicious shortcut themselves or trick a user into creating one, then access the shortcut's properties.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a user account on the target machine.
- **File System Access:** The attacker requires the ability to read the contents of the affected user's `.desktop` files. This could be achieved through direct file system access or via other means.
- **Social Engineering (Optional):** If the attacker cannot directly create shortcuts, they might need to trick the victim into doing so (however, this is not necessarily required).

**Additional Details:**
- The issue affected multiple KDE versions (3.2.x, 3.3.0, 3.3.1 and 3.3.2).
- Patches were made available to remove the password from the URL before creating the link and also to fix the SMB handler not to include the password.
- The vulnerability was reported by Daniel Fabian of SEC Consult.
- The issue was not limited to SMB shares, but other URLs with passwords could also be exposed.
- KDE team recommended verifying that links to remote files do not contain password information through the "Properties" option on the link.
