- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow occurs within Fluxbox when handling a long value provided to the `-title` parameter of `xman`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The Fluxbox window manager crashes completely.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by executing `xman` with a long `-title` parameter from the command line.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to execute commands on a system where Fluxbox is running, but does not need any special privileges.
