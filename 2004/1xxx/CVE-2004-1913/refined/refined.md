The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in NukeCalendar v1.1.a, a PHP-Nuke calendar module.  Here's a breakdown of each vulnerability as described in the text:

**1. Full Path Disclosure:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The application generates standard error messages when invalid input is provided. These messages reveal the full server path to the application's script files. Also, directly accessing block files without proper safeguards results in error messages and full path disclosure.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper error handling and failure to sanitize user-provided input which leads to the exposure of internal path information. Furthermore, incorrect filename checks in the block protection mechanism.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure, which can be used to assist in further attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted requests with invalid input (`eid=foobar`) to `modules.php` or directly accessing block files like `block-Calendar.php`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Basic knowledge of HTTP requests and the application structure.

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user input when displaying calendar entries.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization before displaying user input on the web page.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, potentially allowing them to hijack user sessions, steal cookies, or redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting XSS payloads into the `eid` parameter via HTTP requests, preferably a POST request to bypass a filter on GET requests.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  Knowledge of XSS attacks and how to craft malicious JavaScript payloads.

**3. SQL Injection:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not sanitize user input passed to SQL queries.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization in SQL queries, making the database susceptible to SQL injection.
*    **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially gaining access to sensitive information, modifying data, or taking control of the application. The example provided shows how to extract the username and password hash of the super admin.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Injecting SQL code into the `eid` parameter, specifically the example provided `eid=-1 UNION select null,aid,null,pwd,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null FROM nuke_authors WHERE radminsuper=1 LIMIT 1/*`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Knowledge of SQL injection techniques and the application's database structure.
