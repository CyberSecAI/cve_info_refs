Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2004-1377:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure temporary file creation within the `fixps` and `psmandup` scripts, which are part of the `a2ps` package. These scripts create temporary files in a predictable location.
*   Additionally, a separate vulnerability exists in `a2ps` filename handling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The `fixps` and `psmandup` scripts create temporary files in a way that allows an attacker to predict the file names and locations. This predictable nature leads to a symlink attack vulnerability.
*  **Filename Handling Vulnerability:**  `a2ps` improperly handles filenames, which allows for arbitrary command execution by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A local attacker can exploit the insecure temporary file creation by creating symbolic links in the temporary directory, pointing to a valid file on the system. When `fixps` or `psmandup` are executed, the target file will be overwritten with the rights of the user running the scripts.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By manipulating the filename provided to `a2ps`, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user or script running the `a2ps` command.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The primary attack vector is local. An attacker must have access to the system to create symbolic links in the temporary directory and/or manipulate filenames passed to `a2ps`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker must have user access to the target system.
*   **File System Manipulation:** Ability to create symbolic links in the temporary directory or control filenames used by `a2ps`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The Gentoo advisory mentions that a vulnerability in a2ps filename handling had been previously fixed (CAN-2004-1170) in an earlier revision.
*   The advisory also notes that the file overwrite vulnerability is due to predictable temporary file locations being exploitable via symlink attacks.
*  The vulnerability was discovered by Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pena.
