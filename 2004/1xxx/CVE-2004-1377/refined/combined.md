How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# a2ps: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200501-02**

The fixps and psmandup scripts in the a2ps package are vulnerable to
symlink attacks, potentially allowing a local user to overwrite arbitrary
files. A vulnerability in a2ps filename handling could also result in
arbitrary command execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/a2ps** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.13c-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.13c-r2** |

### Background

a2ps is an Any to Postscript filter that can convert to Postscript from
many filetypes. fixps is a script that fixes errors in Postscript
files. psmandup produces a Postscript file for printing in manual
duplex mode.

### Description

Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pena discovered that the a2ps package
contains two scripts that create insecure temporary files (fixps and
psmandup). Furthermore, we fixed in a previous revision a vulnerability
in a2ps filename handling (CAN-2004-1170).

### Impact

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary files
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
fixps or psmandup is executed, this would result in the file being
overwritten with the rights of the user running the utility. By
enticing a user or script to run a2ps on a malicious filename, an
attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system with the rights
of that user or script.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All a2ps users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/a2ps-4.13c-r2"
```
