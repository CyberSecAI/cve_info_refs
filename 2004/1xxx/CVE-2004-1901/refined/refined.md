{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insecure temporary file handling in the Portage sandbox wrapper.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The sandbox creates lockfiles in the /tmp directory that are vulnerable to hard-link attacks.",
        "The sandbox does not check for the existence of hard links before manipulating lockfiles.",
        "The sandbox does not validate the UID/GID of the lockfiles."
      ],
      "impact": "A local user can overwrite files by creating a hard link to a temporary lockfile. When the sandbox process attempts to write to the lockfile, it overwrites the target of the hardlink with an empty file, potentially leading to a denial-of-service or other security risks. Critical system files or configuration data could be overwritten, causing system instability or opening up new avenues of attack.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local users with write access to the /tmp directory can exploit the vulnerability.",
        "Hard-link attacks are performed using the /tmp directory."
      ],
        "required_attacker_capabilities": [
          "Attacker needs write access to the /tmp directory."
