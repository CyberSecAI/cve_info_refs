- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The GIMPS, SETI@home, and ChessBrain ebuilds install user-owned binaries and init scripts. These scripts are executed with root privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper file ownership. User-owned files can be executed with root privileges due to insecure init scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local privilege escalation or root compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** A local user can modify the user-owned binaries and scripts. When the init scripts are executed, these modified scripts/binaries will be run with root privileges, thus gaining elevated privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local user access to the system to modify the user-owned files.
