```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The QNX 6.1 ftp client is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability in the 'quote' command.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Format string vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation leads to memory corruption and allows attackers to potentially gain 'bin' group privileges, which can be used for malicious purposes like backdooring.
- Attack vectors: The attacker sends a crafted 'quote' command containing format string specifiers to the vulnerable FTP client.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable QNX system running the FTP client and the ability to send commands to the FTP server. The attacker needs to authenticate with a valid username and password.
