Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in OpenBB (Open Bulletin Board) as described in the marc.info content:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Input is not properly sanitized before being displayed on the page.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation/sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application that execute in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to cookie theft or other malicious actions.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   `member.php?action=login&redirect=[XSS]`
        *   `myhome.php?action=newmsg&to=blah[XSS]`
        *   `post.php?action=mail&TID=1[XSS]`
        *   `index.php?redirect=[XSS]`
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts by crafting malicious links and tricking users into visiting them.

2.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** User-supplied input is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation/sanitization before being used in SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion of sensitive data, such as password hashes.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   `/board.php?FID=1[SQL]`
        *   `/member.php?action=list&page=1&sortorder=[SQL]`
        *   `/member.php?action=list&page=1&sortorder=username&perpage=[SQL]`
        *   `/member.php?action=passwdsend&resetid=blah&id=2[SQL]`
        *   `/search.php?&sortby=dateline&sort=DESC&q=open&forums%5B[SQL]%5D`
        *   `/post.php?action=edit&page=1&PID=1[SQL]`
        *   `/post.php?action=post&FID=1[SQL]`
    *  **Required Capabilities:** An attacker can manipulate URL parameters to inject malicious SQL code.

3.  **Arbitrary Command Execution via Unsafe GET Requests:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application uses GET requests for sensitive administrative actions without proper authentication or authorization checks.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Using GET requests for state-changing operations, lack of authentication/authorization on admin actions, flawed filtering using regex.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can cause the application to perform administrative actions by tricking an admin into visiting a malicious link or including the command in a post. This can be used to remove forums, user groups, and IP bans.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   `/cp_forums.php?do=remove&id=1`
        *   `/cp_usergroup.php?do=remove&UGID=1`
        *   `/cp_ipbans.php?action=do_delip&ipid=1`
        *   `/myhome.php?action=delmsg&box=inbox&id=all`
        *   `/post.php?action=edit&PID=1&send=1&delete=yes`
        *   `/moderator.php?action=announce&TID=1`
        *   Using a crafted image tag with a command ending with an image extension.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to trick an admin or user into visiting a specially crafted link, or include malicious code in a post, and exploit the application's use of GET requests for sensitive actions. The filtering mechanism implemented with regex is circumventable.

4.  **Arbitrary PM Reading**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of authorization checks on PM IDs.
    *  **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper access control.
    *   **Impact:** A user can read arbitrary private messages by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.
    *   **Attack Vector:** `http://forum/myhome.php?action=readmsg&id=INT&box=inbox`
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to know the message ID.

5.  **Arbitrary File Upload as Avatar:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper validation on avatar file uploads
    *   **Weaknesses:** Inadequate file type validation.
    *   **Impact:** While this doesn't allow for server-side code execution, it does allow an attacker to upload and execute client-side code (JS, VBS, etc)
    *   **Attack Vector:** Uploading arbitrary files as avatars.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** A user account with the ability to upload an avatar.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by JeiAr of GulfTech Security Research Team and Manuel Lopez.
*   The vendor was contacted, and a fix was planned.
