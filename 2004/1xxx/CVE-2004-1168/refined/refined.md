Name: MaxDB WebTools <= 7.5.00.18 buffer overflow and Denial of Service
Date: 7 Dec 2004
Platforms: Any
Author: Evgeny Demidov

Description:
Two vulnerabilities in MaxDB WebTools have been found:

1.  **WebDav handler long 'Overwrite' header stack overflow:**
    - **Vulnerability:** A stack buffer overflow exists in the WebDav handler when processing a long 'Overwrite' header.
    - **Impact:** Remote root/SYSTEM access.
    - **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted request with a long 'Overwrite' header to the vulnerable WebDav handler.
    - **Required attacker capabilities:** Remote network access.
    - **Ease of exploitation:** Easy to exploit.

2.  **Funny 'wahttp' NULL pointer dereference:**
    - **Vulnerability:** A NULL pointer dereference occurs in the 'wahttp' component when handling a request for a non-existent file.
    - **Attack vector:** Sending a `GET` request for a non-existent file to the server. For example:
        ```
        $ telnet localhost 9999
        GET /file/not/found HTTP/1.0
        [ENTER]
        [ENTER]
        ```
    - **Impact:** Denial of service.
    - **Required attacker capabilities:** Remote network access.
    - **Ease of exploitation:** Easy to exploit.

Fix:
MaxDB 7.0.19 supposedly should fix these problems.
