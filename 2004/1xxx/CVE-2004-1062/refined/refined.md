Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-1062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that some error messages in ViewCVS do not properly sanitize user-provided input. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious script code into the error messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, stemming from the improper handling of user-provided data within error messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Malicious Script Execution: A remote attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within a user's browser session.
- User Compromise: By executing malicious scripts, an attacker can potentially compromise another user's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, data theft, or redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Malicious HTTP Request: An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request that includes the malicious script code. This code will then be included in an error message generated by ViewCVS.
- User Interaction: The malicious script will be executed when a user views the error message containing the injected code in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Remote Attacker: The attacker does not require local access to the server; the vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- Ability to Craft HTTP Requests: The attacker must be able to craft specific HTTP requests with malicious script code.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200412-26) explicitly mentions CVE-2004-1062 as a vulnerability, and provides additional context:
   - ViewCVS is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
   - The vulnerability is found in error messages.
   - The impact is described as an attacker injecting and executing malicious script code, potentially compromising a user's browser
   - A fix was provided with the release of a newer version of the package (`>=www-apps/viewcvs-0.9.2_p20041207-r1`)
