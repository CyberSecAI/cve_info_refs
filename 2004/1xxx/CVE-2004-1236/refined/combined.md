## Multiple implementations of LDAP Directory Server vulnerable to buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#258905

Original Release Date: 2005-01-11 | Last Revised: 2005-01-14

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow in some implementations of the LDAP protocol may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a protocol for accessing network based directories. A lack of bounds checking in some implementations of the LDAP protocol may allow a buffer used to generate error messages to overflow. If a remote unauthenticated attacker supplies a LDAP server with a specially crafted request, they may be able to trigger the buffer overflow to compromise the vulnerable server. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable LDAP server with the privileges of the compromised LDAP process, or crash the LDAP process resulting in a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Users who suspect they are vulnerable are encouraged to check with their vendor to determine the appropriate action to take. |
| --- |

| **Limit Access**  Block or restrict access to the LDAP service (389/tcp or 636/tcp) on affected systems from untrusted networks such as the Internet. Sites, particularly those who are not able to apply the appropriate patches, are encouraged to consider implementing this workaround. Note that this change may break some desired functionality depending on particular site configuration details. As a general rule and a matter of good security practice, the CERT/CC recommends blocking access to all services that are not explicitly required. |

### [OpenLDAP](#SSTT-67PTCJ) Not Affected

Notified:  December 09, 2004  Updated: January 11, 2005

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

The OpenLDAP Project has evaluated

+ OpenLDAP Software 2.2.17 (current "stable" version) and
+ OpenLDAP Software 2.2.19 (current "release" version)

as well as development and release engineering sources, as distributed by the OpenLDAP Project. We found that long attribute names in LDAP request PDUs do not cause a buffer overflow, nor even lead to unexpected behavior (regardless of whether the long attribute name is defined or not in the subschema).

The OpenLDAP Project did not evaluate older versions of OpenLDAP Software. As these versions are no longer maintained by the OpenLDAP Project, the OpenLDAP Project recommends (irregardless of this issue) that users of these versions consider upgrading to a current version.

The OpenLDAP Project also did not evaluate any 3rd party software, including software based upon (in any fashion) OpenLDAP Software.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

US-CERT has no additional comments at this time.

  docId=hpuxSecurityMatrix
Or via anonymous ftp:
  ftp://ftp.itrc.hp.com/export/patches/hp-ux_patch_matrix/

The HP-UX Security Patch Matrix, updated daily, categorizes
security patches by platform/OS release, and by Bulletin topic.
The Security Patch Check tool completely automates the process of
reviewing the Security Patch Matrix for HP-UX 11.XX Versions.

NOTE: Installing patches listed in the Security Patch Matrix will
completely implement the RESOLUTION in the Security Bulletin
_only_ if there are no MANUAL ACTIONS included.

The Security Patch Check tool can also verify that a Security
Bulletin RESOLUTION has been implemented on HP-UX 11.XX Versions
provided that no MANUAL ACTIONS were included. The Security Patch
Check tool cannot verify patches implemented via product upgrade.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
