The provided content details two vulnerabilities affecting PHPKIT: SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**SQL Injection:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `include.php` script uses unsanitized input from the `id` parameter in a SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses:** The code directly incorporates the user-supplied `id` parameter into the SQL query without any sanitization or parameterized queries.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted request to `include.php` with a malicious value in the `id` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   **Root Cause:** The `popup.php` script does not sanitize the `img` parameter, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript.
*   **Weaknesses:**  The `popup.php` script is vulnerable to reflected XSS through the `img` parameter.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing other client-side attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted URL to `popup.php` with malicious JavaScript in the `img` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to get a victim to click a crafted URL.
