Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2004-1184:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `enscript` program, which converts ASCII text to PostScript and other formats, had insufficient input sanitization for filenames and command pipes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unsanitized Input**: Arbitrary commands could be executed through the EPSF pipe support due to unsanitized input.
*   **Missing Sanitization of Filenames**: Specially crafted filenames could cause arbitrary commands to be executed.
*   **Buffer Overflows**: Multiple buffer overflows could cause the program to crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Attackers could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `enscript`.
*   **Denial of Service**: The program could crash due to buffer overflows.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Files/Input Data**: Attackers could design malicious files or input data that, when processed by `enscript`, would trigger the vulnerabilities.
*   **Remote Exploitation**: Through systems like viewcvs, local vulnerabilities could be turned into remote vulnerabilities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious filename or use a command pipe with unsanitized input that is processed by `enscript` either locally or via remote access to the system.

**Summary of relevant content from the provided documents:**

*   **Red Hat:** The Red Hat content does not mention the CVE directly, but provides general information about Red Hat products and services.
*   **Mandriva:** The Mandriva content is unrelated and describes their products.
*   **Apple:** The Apple document lists `enscript` as having multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2004-1184, CVE-2004-1185, CVE-2004-1186, and CVE-2008-3863) and updates `enscript` to version 1.6.4 to address these issues, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Debian:** The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 654-1) specifically addresses CVE-2004-1184, CVE-2004-1185, and CVE-2004-1186 in `enscript`. It states that unsanitized input can cause arbitrary command execution via EPSF pipe support (CAN-2004-1184).  It also mentions missing filename sanitization (CAN-2004-1185) and multiple buffer overflows (CAN-2004-1186). It highlights that these local vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely through applications like viewcvs. The advisory provides upgrade instructions for Debian users.
*   **Gentoo:** The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200502-03) addresses CVE-2004-1184, CVE-2004-1185, and CVE-2004-1186 in `enscript`. It mentions buffer overflows, insufficient sanitization of quotes and shell escape characters in filenames, and arbitrary command execution via command pipes. It also notes that exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with the rights of the user running `enscript`.
*   **Vupen:** The Vupen content is a placeholder.
*   **US-CERT:** US-CERT mentions that Apple's Security Update 2009-002 addresses a vulnerability in enscript, and references the Apple advisory describing the specific vulnerabilities.

The Debian and Gentoo advisories provide the most detailed information about the root cause, weaknesses, impact, and attack vectors specific to CVE-2004-1184. The Apple advisory confirms that `enscript` had multiple vulnerabilities, including the ones associated with CVE-2004-1184.
