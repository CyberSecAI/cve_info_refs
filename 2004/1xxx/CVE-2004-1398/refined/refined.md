Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The `kextload` program contains a format string vulnerability in its `fprintf(stderr, kext_path)` call. The `kext_path` is not properly sanitized before being passed to `fprintf`, which can allow an attacker to control format specifiers.
*   **Buffer Overflow Vulnerability:** The `kextload` program is also vulnerable to a buffer overflow. When given a long input string as a kext path, it overflows a buffer in memory, overwriting critical memory segments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Bug:** Unsanitized input passed to `fprintf` in kextload. This allows an attacker to read and potentially write to arbitrary memory locations.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** Input passed as kext path is not properly validated, leading to overwriting of memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Root Compromise:** By exploiting either the format string vulnerability or the buffer overflow in `kextload`, a local user can gain root privileges on the system if a vulnerable application (such as Roxio Toast) uses kextload with root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker crafts malicious input to `kextload` via a helper application that runs kextload with root privileges.
*   **Abuse of SUID Binary:** The `TDIXSupport` binary, installed by Roxio Toast, is installed setuid root. This makes it a helper application that calls kextload with elevated privileges and thus exploitable by a local user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** An attacker must have a user account on the target system.
*   **Exploitable Application:** An attacker must identify and use a setuid root application that calls `kextload` with a user-controlled path, or directly call kextload as root (via sudo) in order to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand format string and buffer overflow vulnerabilities and be able to craft the malicious input to exploit the vulnerable program.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `kextload` program itself.
*   The `TDIXSupport` binary in Roxio Toast is vulnerable because it invokes `kextload` with root privileges and passes user-controlled input to it.
*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of OSX.
*   The advisory mentions that a format string exploit and buffer overflow exploit are under development.
