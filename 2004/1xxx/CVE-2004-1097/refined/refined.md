{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `cherokee_logger_ncsa_write_string` function uses `fprintf` with a user-controlled string as the format string argument, leading to a format string vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Format string vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious user can crash the server (denial of service) or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Cherokee web server.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a specific URL with format string specifiers when authenticating via `auth_pam`.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The vulnerability is triggered during the authentication process, specifically when using `auth_pam`."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided information includes a demonstration of the vulnerability using `wget` to send a crafted request to a local instance of the vulnerable server. It shows how the server crashes and includes server logs illustrating the format string vulnerability in action. A debugger backtrace is also included pinpointing the crash location within `strlen` during the processing of the crafted input."
