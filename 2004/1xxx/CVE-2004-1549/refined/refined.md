Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**1. File-Server Crash (Bug A)**
   * **Root Cause:**  The file server crashes when it receives a filename longer than 4074 characters.
   * **Weakness:** Lack of proper input validation for filename length.
   * **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) - crashing the file server.
   * **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted upload request with an oversized filename to the file server (port 6004).
   * **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker capable of sending network packets to the server.

**2. File-Server Directory Traversal and Path Disclosure (Bug B)**
   * **Root Cause:** The file server allows directory traversal using the `/` character in filenames, enabling writing to arbitrary paths on the server's disk. The server also discloses the full path of the written file.
   * **Weakness:**  Improper sanitization of file path inputs. Lack of checks against directory traversal characters. Information disclosure of the full file path.
   * **Impact:** Arbitrary file upload and overwrite leading to potential system compromise and/or data corruption.
   * **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted upload request with a malicious filename containing path traversal characters (e.g., `/../../../windows/calc.exe`).
   * **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker capable of sending network packets to the server.

**3. Conference Password Disclosure (Bug C)**
   * **Root Cause:**  The server sends plain-text passwords for conference rooms to clients whenever the user enters the conference menu.
   * **Weakness:** Storing and transmitting conference passwords in plaintext.
   * **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to password-protected conference rooms.
   * **Attack Vector:**  Monitoring network traffic when a client enters the conference menu.
   * **Attacker Capabilities:** Attacker needs to be in a position to sniff network traffic. May require some form of access to the network used by the client.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities are present in ActivePost Standard versions 3.1 and earlier.
*   The file server operates on port 6004.
*   The author of the vulnerability analysis is Luigi Auriemma.
*   There is no official fix for the vulnerabilities.
