| [Description](#c0)  Santiago Tabares    2002-08-13 12:44:42 UTC  ``` Actually the package list is in alphabetical oreder, and it orders the categories from left to right and from top to bottom. Like this: 1  2  3 4  5  6 7  8  It would be easier to read if it would be ordered from top to bottom and then from left to right. Just like this: 1  4  7 2  5  8 3  6  I hope I'm clear. English is not my first language :) ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2002-08-13 15:21:28 UTC  ``` i find up down then left right more readable (i agree with you ;]) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  John Davis (zhen) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-11-21 12:20:46 UTC  ``` Colin, Any ideas on how to make this happen?  //ZhEN ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Rajiv Aaron Manglani (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-12-03 14:20:27 UTC  ``` this could be done with css and a major change to the xsl used for that page. though it would be much easier to change the code which generates the xml (gentoo-xml/scripts/pkgs.py). ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  John Davis (zhen) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-12-10 14:30:02 UTC  ``` Its all your colin! //ZhEN ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Colin Morey (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2003-04-26 19:34:00 UTC  ``` script has been written and is ready to go live, expect it to appear shortly. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Colin Morey (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2003-06-27 02:55:03 UTC  ``` script is done, needs a minor tweak, then i need to get it tested :) ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Colin Morey (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2003-10-01 15:58:34 UTC  ``` after over a year, this is now up and on the site, the code got lost in the ether, but it's up and done, resolving this bug  ``` |  |

# SnipSnap: HTTP response splitting — GLSA **200409-23**

SnipSnap is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks such as web cache
poisoning, cross-user defacement, and cross-site scripting.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/snipsnap-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0\_beta1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0\_beta1** |

### Background

SnipSnap is a user friendly content management system with features
such as wiki and weblog.

### Description

SnipSnap contains various HTTP response splitting vulnerabilities that
could potentially compromise the sites data. Some of these attacks
include web cache poisoning, cross-user defacement, hijacking pages
with sensitive user information, and cross-site scripting. This
vulnerability is due to the lack of illegal input checking in the
software.

### Impact

A malicious user could inject and execute arbitrary script code,
potentially compromising the victim's data or browser.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All SnipSnap users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=dev-java/snipsnap-bin-1.0_beta1"
 # emerge ">=dev-java/snipsnap-bin-1.0beta1"
```
