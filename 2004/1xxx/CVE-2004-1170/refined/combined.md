Other distributions appear to have released security patches for a
similar (perhaps even the same) issue.  See

  <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/11025>

for details.  The patches most of them use look quite reasonable.

tags 283134 security
severity 283134 grave
thanks

Hi,
IMHO this vulnerability is more than a normal bug and Sarge should not
ship with it. a2ps is a tool perfectly suited for automatic use in
scripts (think of print spoolers) and so the exploit set seems not
too small.

There does not seem to be a CVE assignment for this vulnerability.

I've rediffed the FreeBSD fix from Rudolf Polzer for the Debian package
(applicable for Woody and sid), it's attached. It has been tested on
both on Woody and sid.

Cheers,
        Moritz

Agreed.  I'll take care of this.  CVE id is requested, can't do it on
my own unfortunately.

Please let me know which package in sid fixes/will fix this problem.

Thanks a lot,

The sid version has already been NMU fixed by Joey Hess (1:4.13b-4.2)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Solutions for Known and Unknown Vulnerabilities

[FUZZ TESTING](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/products/bestorm)
[VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/products/besecure)

## Simplified network and application security testing

[### BeSTORM

A black box fuzzer, a method of dynamic application security testing, that uncovers unknown security weaknesses during the product development stage, so fixes can be made before a product is launched. This chaos testing style requires no source code to run and offers more than 250 pre-built protocols and modules or the option for custom protocols.](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/products/bestorm)

[### BeSECURE

A vulnerability assessment and management solution.  It enables your security team to accurately identify known vulnerabilities, using threat intelligence to prioritize them by risk. This allows the team to focus on the vulnerabilities that pose the highest risk to your infrastructure and cut through the false positives and low-priority weaknesses.](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/products/besecure)

Together, these solutions strengthen a product’s cybersecurity by adding SecOps into DevOps and through continual, automated vulnerability management and security posture reporting.

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

Package:             a2ps
Vulnerability:       arbitrary code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= a2ps-4.13b-20040818      >= a2ps-4.13b-20050117
OpenPKG 2.2          <= a2ps-4.13b-2.2.0         >= a2ps-4.13b-2.2.1
OpenPKG 2.1          <= a2ps-4.13b-2.1.0         >= a2ps-4.13b-2.1.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Rudolf Polzer discovered [[0]](#0) a vulnerability in GNU a2ps [[1]](#1), a
  converter and pretty-printer for many formats to PostScript. The
  program does not escape shell meta characters properly which could
  lead to the execution of arbitrary commands as a privileged user if
  a2ps is installed as a printer filter. a2ps allows remote attackers to
  execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the filename.
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the
  identifier CAN-2004-1170 [[2]](#2) to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/openpkg
  rpm -q a2ps". If you have the "a2ps" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution) [3][[4]](#4).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][[6]](#6), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][[8]](#8) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[9]](#9), build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [[3]](#3) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [[4]](#4). For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.2, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.2/UPD
  ftp> get a2ps-4.13b-2.2.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig a2ps-4.13b-2.2.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild a2ps-4.13b-2.2.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/a2ps-4.13b-2.2.1.*.rpm
