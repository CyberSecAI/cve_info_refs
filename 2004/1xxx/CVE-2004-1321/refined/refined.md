- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Asante FM2008 Ethernet switch firmware has undocumented "superuser" and "asante" credentials for accessing a CLI via Telnet or serial port. This backdoor is not mentioned in the user manual.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Hardcoded backdoor credentials ("superuser"/"asante")
    - Lack of documentation for the CLI interface
    - Unencrypted configuration backups via TFTP
    - Vulnerability to password override via the web interface
    - Lack of input sanitization leading to username length limitations in the terminal UI.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the switch's CLI using the backdoor credentials, which allows them to manage the device with elevated privileges.
    - Attackers could potentially manipulate network traffic or cause a denial of service by reconfiguring the device.
    - Attackers can access configuration information if they can perform a TFTP dump of the device's config, and potentially modify it, if a checksum can be generated.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - Telnet access
    - Serial port access

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Network access to the switch via Telnet or physical access to the serial port.
    - Knowledge of the backdoor credentials.
    - Ability to craft/capture/edit TFTP backups.
