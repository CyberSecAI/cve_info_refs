- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow occurs when CuteFTP Professional processes overly long replies from a malicious FTP server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability in the processing of FTP server replies. The vulnerability occurs when the reply code is greater than 500 (4xx sometimes also works) and the length of the text following the reply code exceeds 65530 bytes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The described vulnerability causes the CuteFTP Professional application to crash. The author is unsure if arbitrary code execution can be achieved.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious FTP server sends a crafted reply to a CuteFTP client where the reply code is greater than 500 and the length of the text after the code exceeds 65530 bytes. This can occur during normal command processing or when the client connects and receives the server's welcome message.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to control an FTP server that the victim connects to.
