#####################################################################

Advisory Name : phpBB 2.0.8a and lower - IP spoofing vulnerability
Release Date : Apr 18, 2004
Application : phpBB
Version : phpBB 2.0.8a and previous versions
Platform : PHP
Vendor URL : <http://www.phpbb.com/>
Author : Wang / SRR Project Group of Ready Response (srr@readyresponse.org)

#####################################################################

Overview

A vulnerability has been reported to exist in the software that may allow a remote \
user to spoof/forge their IP address, therefore making the phpBB/Administrator \
believe that users/posts are coming from a false IP. The problem reportedly exists in \
the code to obtain the users IP address in the common.php script. This issue is \
caused by blind trust of the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header. A remote attacker may \
exploit this issue to hide their IP address, or appear under the IP address of \
another user. It can also be used to bypass any ban restrictions that an \
administrator has placed on an IP via the PHPBB system.

------------------------------------------------

Discussion

There is code in common.php that starts:

//
// Obtain and encode users IP
//
if( getenv('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR') != '' )
{
 $client_ip = ( !empty($HTTP_SERVER_VARS['REMOTE_ADDR']) ) ? \
$HTTP_SERVER_VARS['REMOTE_ADDR'] : ( ( !empty($HTTP_ENV_VARS['REMOTE_ADDR']) ) ? \
$HTTP_ENV_VARS['REMOTE_ADDR'] : $REMOTE_ADDR );

This code is used to obtain the users/posters IP address. However, if the \
X-Forwarded-For HTTP header is present, it will take the IP address from the header \
and blindly trust it to be the users/posters IP address. The problem is of course \
that the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header is easily forgable via a number of methods.
To take a trivial example...if a user were to spoof their X-Forwarded-For header to \
contain the information:

X-Forwarded-For: 1.3.3.7

When they post on a phpBB board - it blindly trusts that "1.3.3.7" is the users real \
IP address, and will present this IP address to the phpBB administrator if they \
choose to check the posters IP via the phpBB. Not only does this make it a pain for \
the phpBB administrator to then have to track down the users real IP via httpd server \
logs (if this is possible, which is not always the case) - it also makes it possible \
for a user to forge/spoof their IP to that of another user in a possible attempt to \
masquerade as them.

In addition, this makes phpBB's IP ban feature close to useless because anyone can \
change their IP and evade the ban within seconds by changing their X-Forwarded-For \
header to an IP that is not banned (no need for a proxy).
In my opinion, since phpBB handles getting a users IP address in this way...it is a \
security glitch, as it means that IP's can't be trusted by a phpBB administrator, and \
bans can be evaded with ease.

------------------------------------------------

Solution

No official response/solution has been recieved from the phpBB group. A possible \
solution would be to not trust the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header when wishing to obtain \
a valid IP address by which to reference a user/poster.

In common.php find the following code around line 126:

//
// Obtain and encode users IP
//
if( getenv('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR') != '' )
{
        $client_ip = ( !empty($HTTP_SERVER_VARS['REMOTE_ADDR']) ) ? \
$HTTP_SERVER_VARS['REMOTE_ADDR'] : ( ( !empty($HTTP_ENV_VARS['REMOTE_ADDR']) ) ? \
$HTTP_ENV_VARS['REMOTE_ADDR'] : $REMOTE_ADDR );

        $entries = explode(',', getenv('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'));
        reset($entries);
        while (list(, $entry) = each($entries))
        {
                $entry = trim($entry);
                if ( preg_match("/^([0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)/", $entry, \
$ip_list) )  {
                        $private_ip = array('/^0\./', '/^127\.0\.0\.1/', \
'/^192\.168\..*/', '/^172\.((1[6-9])|(2[0-9])|(3[0-1]))\..*/', '/^10\..*/', \
                '/^224\..*/', '/^240\..*/');
                        $found_ip = preg_replace($private_ip, $client_ip, \
$ip_list[1]);

                        if ($client_ip != $found_ip)
                        {
                                $client_ip = $found_ip;
                                break;
                        }
                }
        }
}
else
{
        $client_ip = ( !empty($HTTP_SERVER_VARS['REMOTE_ADDR']) ) ? \
$HTTP_SERVER_VARS['REMOTE_ADDR'] : ( ( !empty($HTTP_ENV_VARS['REMOTE_ADDR']) ) ? \
$HTTP_ENV_VARS['REMOTE_ADDR'] : $REMOTE_ADDR ); }
$user_ip = encode_ip($client_ip);

Replace the above code with:

//
// Obtain and encode users IP
//
$client_ip = ( !empty($HTTP_SERVER_VARS['REMOTE_ADDR']) ) ? \
$HTTP_SERVER_VARS['REMOTE_ADDR'] : ( ( !empty($HTTP_ENV_VARS['REMOTE_ADDR']) ) ? \
$HTTP_ENV_VARS['REMOTE_ADDR'] : $REMOTE_ADDR ); $user_ip = encode_ip($client_ip);

This will remove the code that tries to obtain the posters IP via X-Forwarded-For.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Good work guys ;)

I have put together a patch using the quick-fix Wang &
SRR Project Group suggested, which I hope will make
your job easier when fixing this issue in your board.

Here's the patch file:

If my mail client obfuscates the patch, the patch is
available here:
<<http://www.nettwerked.co.uk/code/phpbb-ipspoof.patch>>.

The patch applies cleanly to phpBB2 2.0.8, 2.0.8a and
perhaps earlier versions.

Hope this helps is some way.

Thank you for your time.
Shaun.
