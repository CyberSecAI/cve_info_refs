The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in PostNuke 0.726 Phoenix, as identified by Janek Vind "waraxe."

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **A. Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of access control for various PHP files within the application's directory structure.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Direct access to PHP files reveals the full server path where the application is hosted, due to the lack of proper security measures that would prevent access to these files directly via HTTP requests.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure; allows an attacker to gather sensitive information about the server's file system layout and potentially use this information for further attacks.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Direct HTTP requests to vulnerable files.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the application.

    *   **Specific vulnerable locations:**
        *   `includes/blocks/` directory
        *   `pnadodb/` directory
        *   `modules/NS-NewUser/user.php`
        *   `modules/NS-Your_Account/user/links/links.changehome.php`
        *    `modules/NS-Your_Account/user/case/case.changehome.php`
        *   `modules/NS-LostPassword/user.php`
        *    `modules/NS-Multisites/chgtheme.inc.php`
        *    `modules/NS-Multisites/head.inc.php`
        *   `modules/NS-Multisites/print.inc.php`
        *   `modules/NS-User/tools.php`
        *   `modules/NS-User/user.php`

*   **B. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper input sanitization when processing user-supplied data in the `Downloads`, `Web_Links` modules, and the `openwindow.php` script.
    *   **Weaknesses:** User-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being included in web page output.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, and phishing attacks.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted HTTP requests with malicious JavaScript code within the parameters of the vulnerable scripts, e.g., query strings for "search" or "ratedownload."
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft and send HTTP requests to the application.
    *   **Note:** The exploit only works if special anti-filtering measures are not in place.

    *   **Specific vulnerable locations:**
        *   `Downloads` module (`req=ratedownload` and `req=search`)
        *   `Web_Links` module (`req=search`)
         *   `javascript/openwindow.php` script

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory notes that the XSS attacks require circumventing special anti-filtering measures (which are not specified) to be successful.
*   The report provides specific examples of URLs demonstrating the vulnerabilities.
