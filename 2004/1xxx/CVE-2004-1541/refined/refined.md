== Vulnerability Report for SecureCRT - Remote Command Execution ==

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- SecureCRT registers a URL protocol handler that allows it to be launched when a telnet:// link is clicked in a web browser.
- The application accepts a command line option (/F) to specify a configuration folder.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Insecure URL Protocol Handler:** The use of a URL protocol handler in combination with command-line options allows for the manipulation of SecureCRT's behavior through crafted URLs.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the path provided through the /F command line argument, specifically when used in combination with the URL protocol handler, allowing an attacker to specify an SMB share for configuration files.
- **Configuration File Vulnerability:** SecureCRT's configuration file allows specification of login scripts which enables attackers to execute arbitrary code through a crafted configuration file and associated script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page containing a telnet:// URL that specifies a network share controlled by the attacker as a configuration location. By doing so, they can force SecureCRT to load a malicious configuration file. This file can be crafted to include a login script that executes arbitrary commands on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** An attacker could host an HTML page containing a crafted telnet:// link.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker could trick the user into clicking a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attacker needs to host the malicious configuration file on a network share accessible by the victim.
- **Knowledge of SecureCRT:** The attacker needs to understand how SecureCRT processes command line arguments and configuration files.
- **User Interaction (Click):** The victim must click on the crafted telnet:// link for the exploit to be triggered.
