My address bar displays the complete address, however the status bar does not.
Is this the desired behavior?

The same is for me. But the bug is I belive being unable to determine where does
the link refere to! So, with <http://www.microsoft.com> being seen in the status
bar, I gas that if I click that I will go to <http://www.microsoft.com>, but not
to another site!

The Internet Explorer bug is about the addressbar (= location bar), which is the
one at the top. Not at the bottom (= status bar), which is easy enough to fake
with JavaScript. Mozilla and Firebird even have a special preference to prevent
that.
We have somewhere a bug about the display of control characters in the
statusbar. It's the %00 that cuts of the rest of the URL.

See also [bug 122445](/show_bug.cgi?id=122445 "RESOLVED FIXED - URL: Spoof - userpass looks like a hostname") for another way to present fake information in the location
bar. That will also fix this bug. The %01%00 itself doesn't present a problem
for Mozilla, because we still show the entire URL.

But why there is not the same with status bar. I've got JavaScript switched off
for changing the status bar and used to trust what it shows.

I think this bug should stay open to cover the fact that %00 in a URL causes the
statusbar display when hovering over a link to be incorrect. (That is somewhat
serious when Javascript is turned off or when the ability of sites to change the
status bar is disabled, since in those cases the status bar ought to be able to
be trusted.)Status: RESOLVED → UNCONFIRMEDResolution: DUPLICATE → ---

The method in question seems to be nsIXULBrowserWindow::setOverLink.
The unescaping happens at the C++ caller's caller:

yes, this should be a MUST. actually, it should not unescape any control
characters.

IMHO the easiest way to fix this bug is to a) call UnEscapeNonAsciiURI instead
and b) fix NS\_UnescapeURL to accept the flag that UnEscapeNonAsciiURI uses.
A more comprehensive fix would unescape all characters except when the result is
[\x00-\x20#$%&+,./:;=?@\x7F]

This fixes the link in question. It does mean that some ascii characters will
no longer be unescaped, though I'm not sure if that's a big a problem.

i think some checks for the displayable ascii range would be better.

plus, what about all the other places where UnEscapeURIForUI is called? don't
we need to fix the behavior of that function instead of trying to circumvent it
only for nsWebShell?

Ideally, we want to show the URI that would (a) appear in the URI bar and, more
importantly, (b) be the URI sent to the server. I've often noticed that when I
hover over a data: URI, the status bar shows all kinds of junk, when it should
just be showing the URI as escaped.

That might work, except what encoding do you assume for the high-bit characters?QA Contact: pawyskoczka → ian

That's about the hostname; should we just unescape that part's high-bit
characters? I think we can safely always assume it's UTF-8 if we do just the
host part (is that right?).

That can be trivially shown to not work, especially for, e.g., data: URIs.

Ian: for numerous non-ASCII "speaking" users, having the browser automatically
decode escaped-URLs is very helpful. of course, unescaping must be done very
cautiously because there are many times when an unescaped byte might be
misinterpreted in the wrong charset. clearly, it seems like data: URLs should
be excluded from those that we try to unescape. i think the code in intl needs
to be beefed up to make limited choices about what it unescapes.

It's not.
It's not clear to me why we have both UnEscapeURIForUI and UnEscapeNonASCIIURI,
and I won't really have time for the relevant CVS archeology in the near future,
but any changes to the way those functions are used should really look up why
they were added. In the end, I suspect, we don't need both of those functions;
we just need UnEscapeURIForUI to be sane.
It's not clear to me why no one bothered to cc some intl people, who would
perhaps even know the answers to some of the questions raised...

Oh, and Ian, in the intl cases the URI sent to the server is URI-escaped

If you say so. Personally, as a non-ASCII "speaking" user I find I prefer to
know what the URI actually is before it is sent over the wire, but I admit I'm
not a typical user.
> [...]
Fair enough. I retract my objections; I think bz is right that we should try to
factor out our various attempts at this into a single "unescape for UI" function
that we use for when a URI is to be displayed in the UI (except for the location
bar, where I \_really\_ think we should show the real URI).

Careful here: we also want to avoid spoofing by the use of similar-looking
characters. Being able to see the URI as it will be transmitted over the wire as
well as in decoded form is a security requirement IMO.

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win95; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031208 MultiZilla/1.6.0.0b)
I'm a fairly knowledgeable, long time (and very faithful) user of Mozilla, and
even though I have disabled changing status bar text, I could easily get fooled
by this. I'd probably rely more on the status bar pre-click than the address
bar post-click for checking whether the site URL displayed in the link is bogus,
and in my implementation of Mozilla, the staus bar does only display the bogus
site address when using the Secunia test page.
My choice would be, for these tricky URLs that aren't easily parsed by eye
(especially for the newbies we are trying to lure to Mozilla), is one of the
notifications suggested in [Bug 122445](/show_bug.cgi?id=122445 "RESOLVED FIXED - URL: Spoof - userpass looks like a hostname"). At a minimum, I'd like to see the one in
[Comment #93](/show_bug.cgi?id=228176#c93 "VERIFIED FIXED - %00 in a URL causes incorrect display of hovered link in status bar"), which displays '<http://www.server.com/path> [login=user,
password=pass]' -- thus making it clear there's more than meets the eye of the
casual observer. I like even better the suggestion in 122445's [Comment #84](/show_bug.cgi?id=228176#c84 "VERIFIED FIXED - %00 in a URL causes incorrect display of hovered link in status bar"),
which, when a tricky link is clicked on, cautions the user about what is really
going on, and offers a chance to bail out. I'd suggest making this kind of
detailed warning a security preferance, enabled by default (since we want
canverts from IE to not feel like they're still in a minefield). Mozilla
doesn't break under malware like Internet Explorer, and I think we should strive
to make Mozilla the safest tool a user can find.

Another problem with Mozilla is, that you can´t see any difference between g and
q in the status bar. For example <http://www.google.de> and <http://www.qooqle.de>
look exactly the same in the status bar.
Using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031208

I don´t know if this is already a known bug, but it certainly can fool people

Just a quick hint: you can use the userContent.css to notice these SpoofUrls.
Just add the following to the userContent.css in your Chrome dir:
:link[href\*="%00@"], :visited[href\*="%00@"],:link[href\*="%01@"],
:visited[href\*="%01@"] {
cursor: help;
}
This changes the cursor to a questionmark over a link with %00@ in it.
You can also use this to recolor the link or even not to display it.

I'd vote for not unescaping the control characters 0x00-0x20, but at least 0x00
for 1.6final.
Digging deep in the source history, unifying unescape functions and thinking
about doing the right thing is good. But making Mozilla the next release version
not spoofable through the known "exploits" is IMO a first necessary step.

I added 'esc\_ExcludeControl' (that is only meaningful for unescaping) and
modified nsISubTextURI::UnEscapeURIForUI call NS\_UnescapeURL with that flag
set.
With the flag set, C0 characters and DEL (0x7F) are excluded from unescaping.
I also changed the meaning of esc\_OnlyNonAscii. When escaping, it skips only
graphic ASCII characters (that is, 0x20 - 0x7E). In the other direction, it
skips (excludes from unescaping) all ASCII characters (as it used to).

+cc andreas:
The "status bar should display URL's unescaped" design is possibly attributable
to him. I think in the past, I have liked the user-friendliness, but had
concerns about the larger impact, since I never had time to do a full set of
character set testing.

can you call this esc\_SkipControl instead? "skip" is shorter and
just as clear i think.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
