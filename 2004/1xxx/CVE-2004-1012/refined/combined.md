# USN-31-1: cyrus21-imapd vulnerabilities

24 November 2004

cyrus21-imapd vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

Stefan Esser discovered several buffer overflows in the Cyrus IMAP

server. Due to insufficient checking within the argument parser of

the "partial" and "fetch" commands, an argument like "body[p" was

detected as "body.peek". This could cause a buffer overflow which

could be exploited to execute arbitrary attacker-supplied code.

This update also fixes an exploitable buffer overflow that could be

triggered in situations when memory allocation fails (i. e. when no

free memory is available any more).

Both vulnerabilities can lead to privilege escalation to root.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

     Advisory: Cyrus IMAP Server multiple remote vulnerabilities
 Release Date: 2004/11/22
Last Modified: 2004/11/22
       Author: Stefan Esser [s.esser@e-matters.de]

  Application: Cyrus IMAP Server <= 2.2.8
     Severity: Several vulnerabilities within Cyrus IMAP Server
               allow remote execution of arbitrary code
         Risk: Critical
Vendor Status: Vendor has released a bugfixed version.
    Reference: <http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/152004.html>

Overview:

   IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is an Internet standards-
   track protocol for accessing messages (mail, bboards, news, etc).
   The Cyrus IMAP server differs from other IMAP server implementations
   in that it is generally intended to be run on sealed servers, where
   normal users are not permitted to log in. The mailbox database is
   stored in parts of the filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP
   system. All user access to mail is through the IMAP, POP3, or KPOP
   protocols.

   During an audit of imapd several vulnerabilities were discovered
   ranging from a standard stack overflow, over out of bounds heap
   corruptions, to a bug caused by the use of programming constructs
   that are undefined according to the C standard.

   All these bugs can lead to remote execution of arbitrary code
   depending on the skills of the attacker.

Details:

   [01 - IMAPMAGICPLUS preauthentification overflow]

   Affected Versions: 2.2.4 - 2.2.8

   When the option imapmagicplus is activated on a server the PROXY
   and LOGIN commands suffer a standard stack overflow, because the
   username is not checked against a maximum length when it is copied
   into a temporary stack buffer. This bug is especially dangerous
   because it can be triggered before any kind of authentification
   took place.

   [02 - PARTIAL command out of bounds memory corruption]

   Affected Versions: <= 2.2.6 (because unexploitable in 2.2.7, 2.2.8)

   Due to a bug within the argument parser of the partial command an
   argument like "body[p" will be wrongly detected as "body.peek".
   Because of this the bufferposition gets increased by 10 instead of 5
   and could therefore point outside the allocated memory buffer for
   the rest of the parsing process.
   In imapd versions prior to 2.2.7 the handling of "body" or "bodypeek"
   arguments was broken so that the terminating ']' got overwritten by
   a '\0'. Combined the two problems allow a potential attacker to
   overwrite a single byte of malloc() control structures, which leads
   to remote code execution if the attacker successfully controls the
   heap layout.

   [03 - FETCH command out of bounds memory corruption]

   Affected Versions: <= 2.2.8

   The argument parser of the fetch command suffers a bug very similiar
   to the partial command problem. Arguments like "body[p", "binary[p"
   or "binary[p" will be wrongly detected and the bufferposition can
   point outside of the allocated buffer for the rest of the parsing
   process.
   When the parser triggers the PARSE_PARTIAL macro after such a
   malformed argument was received this can lead to a similiar one byte
   memory corruption and allows remote code execution, when the heap
   layout was successfully controlled by the attacker.

   [04 - APPEND command uses undefined programming construct ]

   Affected Version: 2.2.7, 2.2.8

   To support MULTIAPPENDS the cmd_append handler uses the global
   stage array. This array is one of the things that gets destructed
   when the fatal() function is triggered.
   When the Cyrus IMAP code adds new entries to this array this is
   done with the help of the postfix increment operator in combination
   with memory allocation functions. The increment is performed on a
   global variable counting the number of allocated stages. Because
   the memory allocation function can fail and therefore internally
   call fatal() this construct is undefined arcording to ANSI C.
   This means that it is not clearly defined if the numstage counter
   is already increased when fatal() is called or not. While older
   gcc versions increase the counter after the memory allocation
   function has returned, on newer gcc versions (3.x) the counter
   gets actually increased before.
   In such a case the stage destructing process will try to free an
   uninitialised and maybe attacker supplied pointer. Which again
   could lead to remote code execution. (Because it is hard for an
   attacker to let the memory allocation functions fail in the right
   moment no PoC code for this problem was designed)

Proof of Concept:

   e-matters is not going to release exploits for any of these
   vulnerabilities to the public.

Disclosure Timeline:

   06. November 2004 - Sent an email to the Cyrus IMAP team
   11. November 2004 - Got reply from the Cyrus developers and
                       shared the information with vendor-sec
   17. November 2004 - Cyurs IMAP team contacted vendor-sec with
                       the official patch
   22. November 2004 - Cyrus IMAP Server 2.2.9 released
   22. November 2004 - Public Disclosure

CVE Information:

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
   assigned the name CAN-2004-1011 to issue 01, the name CAN-2004-1012
   to issue 02 and the name CAN-2004-1013 to issue 03.

Recommendation:

   It is strongly recommended to upgrade to the updated version of
   Cyrus IMAP Server as soon as possible because there is no
   workaround.

# Cyrus IMAP Server: Multiple remote vulnerabilities — GLSA **200411-34**

The Cyrus IMAP Server contains multiple vulnerabilities which could lead to
remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-mail/cyrus-imapd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.2.10** |

### Background

The Cyrus IMAP Server is an efficient, highly-scalable IMAP e-mail
server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the argument
parsers of the 'partial' and 'fetch' commands of the Cyrus IMAP Server
(CAN-2004-1012, CAN-2004-1013). There are also buffer overflows in the
'imap magic plus' code that are vulnerable to exploitation as well
(CAN-2004-1011, CAN-2004-1015).

### Impact

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary
code with the rights of the user running the Cyrus IMAP Server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Cyrus-IMAP Server users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/cyrus-imapd-2.2.10"
```

CVE ID         : CAN-2004-1012 CAN-2004-1013
Debian Bug     : 282681

Stefan Esser discovered several security related problems in the Cyrus
IMAP daemon.  Due to a bug in the command parser it is possible to
access memory beyond the allocated buffer in two places which could
lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.19-9.2

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.17-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd package immediately.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
