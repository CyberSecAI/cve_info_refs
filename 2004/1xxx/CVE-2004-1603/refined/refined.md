- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The cPanel backup system follows hard links when creating backups. This allows a user to create a hard link in their web accessible directory to a file outside of their allowed scope and then include this file in a backup archive by initiating a backup through the cPanel interface.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure handling of hard links during backups, allowing unauthorized access to files outside user's permissions.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive system files, such as /etc/shadow, by creating a hard link and including it in a backup archive.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack can be executed using any method that allows the creation of hard links (e.g., php, cgi, crontab or shell access) and initiation of a backup through cPanel's web interface.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have a valid cPanel user account and the ability to create hard links within their web accessible directory, such as the `public_html` folder, and must have access to the cPanel interface.
