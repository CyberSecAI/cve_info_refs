NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: Oracle 10g character conversion bug
Systems Affected: Oracle 10g/AS on all operating systems
Severity: High risk
Vendor URL: <http://www.oracle.com/>
Author: David Litchfield [ davidl at ngssoftware.com ]
Relates to: <http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/oracle-01.txt>
Date of Public Advisory: 23rd December 2004
Advisory number: #NISR2122004G
Advisory URL: <http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/oracle23122004G.txt>

Description
***********
Due to character conversion problems in Oracle 10g with Oracle's Application
server it is possible to bypass pl/sql exclusions and gain access to the
database server as SYS.

Details
*******
There is a character conversion bug in 10g that can lead to a compromised
backend database server. Both Windows and Linux are affected. Consider the
following set up. There's a Oracle HTTP Server (running apache 1.3.22 on
Windows) using the PL/SQL module feeding into a 10g box running on Windows
and a 10g box running on Linux. The character set for both instances is
WE8ISO8859P1. When the app server receives a request of

[http://server/pls/windad/%FF%FF%FF%FF%FF](http://server/pls/windad/%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD)

the %FFs are converted to the byte 0xFF (as expected) but sniffing the
database response to the app server we get

"ORA-06550: line 8, column 2: PLS-00201: identifier 'YYYYY' must be
declared....."

10g, when using the WE8ISO8859P1 character set, converts 0xFF to 0x59 - that
is uppercase Y. Due to this conversion an attacker can request

[http://server/pls/windad/S%FFS.OWA_UTIL.CELLSPRINT?P_THEQUERY=select+usernam](http://server/pls/windad/S%EF%BF%BDS.OWA_UTIL.CELLSPRINT?P_THEQUERY=select+usernam)
e+from+all_users

and gain access to "banned" and dangerous procedures. The character set for
the HTTP server is set to AMERICAN_AMERICA.WE8ISO8859P1.

If, however, we set the character set on the HTTP Server to
ENGLISH_UNITEDKINGDOM.WE8MSWIN1252 not only is the 0xFF still converted to
0x59 but if

[http://server/pls/windad/%9F%9F%9F%9F%9F%9F](http://server/pls/windad/%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD)

is requested

the _app_server_ (note - not 10g) converts the %9F to a Y and again this
allows us to do the following

[http://server/pls/windad/S%9FS.OWA_UTIL.CELLSPRINT?P_THEQUERY=select+usernam](http://server/pls/windad/S%EF%BF%BDS.OWA_UTIL.CELLSPRINT?P_THEQUERY=select+usernam)
e+from+all_users

again giving access to the "banned" and dangerous procedures.

Other character sets and scenarios may cause similar problems.

Fix Information
***************
A patch (#68) was released for this problem by Oracle. See
<http://metalink.oracle.com/> for more details. NGSSQuirreL for Oracle
(<http://www.nextgenss.com/squirrelora.htm>), can be used to assess whether
your Oracle servers are vulnerable to this.
