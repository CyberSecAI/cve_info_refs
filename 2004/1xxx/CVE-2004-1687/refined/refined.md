{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing HTTP responses.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "HTTP Response Splitting. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and content into the server's response by inserting CRLF sequences (%0d%0a) into the 'location' parameter of the /down.asp endpoint.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can poison web caches, conduct XSS attacks, and potentially perform other malicious actions due to the ability to control the HTTP response.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the /down.asp endpoint with a malicious 'location' parameter containing CRLF characters and HTTP headers.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No specific privilege is needed. The attacker can also manipulate HTTP requests through proxies or malicious web pages."
