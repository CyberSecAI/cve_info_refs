| [Description](#c0)  Jason Stubbs (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-27 08:05:51 UTC  ``` The first vulnerability is due to a hard-coded of /tmp/dispatch-conf.changes. On startup this file is safely moved to dispatch-conf.changes.old if it exists, but a user can create a symlink between that time and when the log is first written to. Fixed it by making it a config option and disabling it by default.  The second vulnerability is created by dispatch-conf's use of "dispatch-conf.$(pidof dispath-conf)" for it's temporary files. Fixed this by safely creating a directory in and doing all work in there instead.  Changes are in CVS and will go out in portage-2.0.51-r3. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-01 14:07:37 UTC  ``` portage team please provide a patched ebuild. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-05 02:53:22 UTC  ``` Using this bug for stable marking.

# Portage, Gentoolkit: Temporary file vulnerabilities — GLSA **200411-13**

dispatch-conf (included in Portage) and qpkg (included in Gentoolkit) are
vulnerable to symlink attacks, potentially allowing a local user to
overwrite arbitrary files with the rights of the user running the script.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-apps/portage** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.0.51-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.51-r3** |

| Package | **app-portage/gentoolkit** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.2.0\_pre10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.2.0\_pre10-r1**revision >= **0.2.0\_pre8-r1** |

### Background

Portage is Gentoo's package management tool. The dispatch-conf utility
allows for easy rollback of configuration file changes and automatic
updates of configurations files never modified by users. Gentoolkit is
a collection of Gentoo specific administration scripts, one of which is
the portage querying tool qpkg.

### Description

dispatch-conf and qpkg use predictable filenames for temporary files.

### Impact

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary files
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
an affected script is called, this would result in the file to be
overwritten with the rights of the user running the dispatch-conf or
qpkg, which could be the root user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Portage users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/portage-2.0.51-r3"
```

All Gentoolkit users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-portage/gentoolkit-0.2.0_pre8-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
