# Buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities in LCDproc — GLSA **200404-19**

Multiple remote vulnerabilities have been found in the LCDd server,
allowing execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the LCDd user.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-misc/lcdproc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.4.4-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.4.5** |

### Background

LCDproc is a program that displays various bits of real-time system
information on an LCD. It makes use of a local server (LCDd) to collect
information to display on the LCD.

### Description

Due to insufficient checking of client-supplied data, the LCDd server is
susceptible to two buffer overflows and one string buffer vulnerability. If
the server is configured to listen on all network interfaces (see the Bind
parameter in LCDproc configuration), these vulnerabilities can be triggered
remotely.

### Impact

These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to execute code with the rights of
the user running the LCDproc server. By default, this is the "nobody" user.

### Workaround

A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are advised
to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.

### Resolution

LCDproc users should upgrade to version 0.4.5 or later:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=app-misc/lcdproc-0.4.5"
 # emerge ">=app-misc/lcdproc-0.4.5"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

 <http://www.priv8security.com>			  Adriano Lima

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package Name: LCDproc
Vendor URL:  <http://lcdproc.omnipotent.net>
Date:  2004-02-22
ID:  PSR-#2004-001
Affected Version: All Versions
Risk: HIGH

***************************************************************************

Package Description:

LCDproc is a software that displays real-time system information from your Linux/*BSD \
box on a LCD. The server supports several serial devices: Matrix Orbital, Crystal \
Fontz, Bayrad, LB216, LCDM001 (kernelconcepts.de), Wirz-SLI, Cwlinux(.com) and \
PIC-an-LCD; and some devices connected to the LPT port: HD44780, STV5730, T6963, \
SED1520 and SED1330. Various clients  that display things such as CPU load, system \
load, memory usage, uptime, and a lot more, are available.

Problem Description:

A remote exploitable buffer overflow that allows remote users to execute an arbitrary \
code was found on LCDd server. The problem appears on function \
parse_all_client_messages() of parse.c file, a loop does not check if MAXARGUMENTS \
were reached, causing the program to crash when lots of arguments are passed to the \
function.

Testing:

See proof of concept code on
<http://www.priv8security.com/releases/priv8lcd44.pl>

Solutions:

	It is recommended that all users upgrade to version 0.4.4 and install the follow \
patch coded by Rodrigo Rubira Branco.  \
<http://www.priv8security.com/releases/lcdproc.patch>
