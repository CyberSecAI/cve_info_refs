# Tomcat: Insecure installation — GLSA **200408-15**

Improper file ownership may allow a member of the tomcat group to execute
scripts as root.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/tomcat** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.0.27-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.0.27-r3**revision >= **4.1.30-r4**revision >= **3.3.2-r2** |

### Background

Tomcat is the Apache Jakarta Project's official implementation of Java
Servlets and Java Server Pages.

### Description

The Gentoo ebuild for Tomcat sets the ownership of the Tomcat init
scripts as tomcat:tomcat, but those scripts are executed with root
privileges when the system is started. This may allow a member of the
tomcat group to run arbitrary code with root privileges when the Tomcat
init scripts are run.

### Impact

This could lead to a local privilege escalation or root compromise by
authenticated users.

### Workaround

Users may change the ownership of /etc/init.d/tomcat\* and
/etc/conf.d/tomcat\* to be root:root:

`# chown -R root:root /etc/init.d/tomcat*
# chown -R root:root /etc/conf.d/tomcat*`
### Resolution

All Tomcat users can upgrade to the latest stable version, or simply
apply the workaround:

```
 # emerge sync
 # emerge -pv ">=www-servers/tomcat-5.0.27-r3"
 # emerge ">=www-servers/tomcat-5.0.27-r3"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Tero Pelander    2004-08-02 23:35:54 UTC  ``` If non-root user has access to tomcat group and tomcat is started by default configuration then the user has root rights.  Due to following code in ebuild pkg_preinst() { ... chown -R tomcat:tomcat ${D} ... } the files /etc/init.d/tomcat5 and /etc/conf.d/tomcat5 are owned by tomcat:tomcat. When the service is started at server startup the actions are done as root.   Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-03 08:03:55 UTC  ``` This effectively allow privilege escalation from tomcat group users to root.  ebuild should be corrected so that init and conf files are owned by root.  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Thomas Matthijs (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-06 07:36:28 UTC  ``` i believe this is fixed in tomcat-3.3.2-r2 tomcat-4.1.30-r4 tomcat-5.0.27-r3  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-07 03:12:59 UTC  ``` Thanks axxo. Ready for a GLSA -- if we decide one is needed ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-08 12:22:17 UTC  ``` we need a GLSA on this one.  local root exploit == bad. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-15 08:37:37 UTC  ``` GLSA 200408-15 ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Stuart Herbert (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-15 09:23:39 UTC  ``` FYI,  Tomcat was moved from net-www to www-servers a week ago.  Best regards, Stu ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-15 11:18:53 UTC  ``` Fixed.  Thx Stu ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
