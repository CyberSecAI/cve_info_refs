Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the marc.info content, which appears to be related to CVE-2004-1658:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in how Kerio Personal Firewall (KPF) implements its Application Security feature. KPF hooks several native Windows APIs in kernel-space by modifying entries within the System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT). This mechanism is used to intercept and control the execution of programs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Direct Kernel Memory Modification:** The vulnerability is that a malicious program running with sufficient privileges can directly modify the kernel's SSDT through direct writes to `\device\physicalmemory`. By doing so, it can restore the original (unhooked) entries in the SSDT, effectively disabling KPF's Application Security feature. This allows the malicious program to bypass the firewall's execution protection.
*   **Lack of Protection for Kernel Structures:** The core issue is the lack of protection mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modifications to the SSDT, which is a critical kernel data structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of Execution Protection:** Successful exploitation allows malicious software to bypass the Application Security feature of KPF. This means that malware can execute without being detected or blocked by KPF's execution protection mechanism.
*   **System Compromise:** By bypassing KPF's execution control, the attacker can potentially execute malicious programs and potentially gain control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Program Execution:** The attack vector is through the execution of a malicious program on the user's system. This program needs to have sufficient privileges to directly write to kernel memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute a program locally on the target machine.
*   **Sufficient Privileges:** The malicious program must run with system-level privileges or higher to have the ability to directly write to physical memory and modify kernel data structures.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability specifically affects KPF's execution protection, not its firewall feature.
*   The advisory mentions that KPF versions 4.0.16 on Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP SP1, and SP2 are vulnerable.
