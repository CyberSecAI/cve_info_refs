Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an **array overflow** vulnerability in how Icecast server handles HTTP headers. Specifically, the server has a limit of 32 headers in a client's HTTP request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** Sending more than 31 headers in an HTTP request causes the server to overwrite the return address of a function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By carefully crafting the 32nd header to contain shellcode, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This allows them to gain complete control over the vulnerable machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed through a specially crafted HTTP request sent to the Icecast server. This makes the vulnerability exploitable remotely, requiring only network access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Icecast server, implying they need to have network connectivity to the server (no need to be on the same local network as the server).
*   **Knowledge of HTTP:** The attacker needs to understand how to structure HTTP requests to include a large number of headers.
*   **Shellcode Creation:** The attacker needs to be capable of creating or obtaining appropriate shellcode for the target operating system (Win32 in the provided details).

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when the Icecast server processes an HTTP request with more than 31 headers.
*   The 32nd header's content overwrites the return address on the stack, allowing for control flow hijacking.
*   The exploit leverages this by placing shellcode in the 32nd header, causing the shellcode to be executed when the function returns.
*   The vulnerability is reportedly most easily exploited on Win32 systems, but other platforms might be affected under certain conditions.

**Additional Details**

* A proof-of-concept exploit (iceexec.zip) is publicly available.
* A modified exploit has been created that uses the shellcode to download Netcat and run it to create a reverse shell on port 9999

**Affected Versions:**

*   Icecast versions 2.0.1 and earlier are vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.0.2.
