# eGroupWare: Multiple XSS vulnerabilities — GLSA **200409-06**

The eGroupWare software contains multiple cross site scripting
vulnerabilities.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/egroupware** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.0.00.003** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.00.004** |

### Background

eGroupWare is a suite of web-based group applications including
calendar, address book, messenger and email.

### Description

Joxean Koret recently discovered multiple cross site scripting
vulnerabilities in various modules for the eGroupWare suite. This
includes the calendar, address book, messenger and ticket modules.

### Impact

These vulnerabilities give an attacker the ability to inject and
execute malicious script code, potentially compromising the victim's
browser.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version of eGroupWare.

### Resolution

All eGroupWare users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=www-apps/egroupware-1.0.00.004"
 # emerge ">=www-apps/egroupware-1.0.00.004"
```
