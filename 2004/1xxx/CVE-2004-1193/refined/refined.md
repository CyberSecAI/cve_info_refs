The provided content is related to CVE-2004-1193.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Prevx Home v1.0 implements its registry and buffer overflow protection by hooking native APIs in kernel-space via modification of the System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT). This hooking mechanism is vulnerable to direct service table restoration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The software's intrusion prevention relies on modifying the SSDT in kernel-space.
- The SSDT modifications can be reverted by a malicious process with administrator privileges using direct writes to physical memory.
- This allows the protection mechanism of Prevx Home to be completely disabled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disables registry and buffer overflow protection offered by Prevx Home
- Allows malicious programs to modify protected registry keys (e.g. Run-key, Internet Explorer settings) and execute buffer overflow exploits undetected.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct writes to the physical memory device (\device\physicalmemory) to restore the System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrator privileges to write directly to physical memory.
- Ability to execute malicious code on the target machine.
