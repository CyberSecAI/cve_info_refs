SIG^2 Vulnerability Research Advisory

Prevx Home v1.0 Instrusion Prevention Features Can Be Disabled by Direct Service \
Table Restoration

by Tan Chew Keong
Release Date: 22 Nov 2004

ADVISORY URL

<http://www.security.org.sg/vuln/prevxhome.html>

SUMMARY

Prevx Home (<https://www.prevx.com>) is a state-of-the-art Host Intrusion Prevention \
Software that is designed to protect the user against the next Zero Day Hacker \
attacks, Internet Worms and Spyware Installation without expecting the user to \
perform constant updates to their system.

Prevx Home's registry and buffer overflow protection features are implemented by \
hooking several native APIs in kernel-space by modifying entries within the SDT \
ServiceTable. This means that a malicious program with Administrator privilege can \
disable these features by restoring the running kernel's SDT ServiceTable with direct \
writes to \device\physicalmemory.

TESTED SYSTEM

Prevx Home Version 1.0 Build 2.1.0.0 on WinXP SP0, SP2.

DETAILS

Prevx Home prevents malicious code from modifying critical Windows registry keys by \
prompting the user for action whenever such an attempt is detected. Examples of \
protected registry keys include the Run-key and Internet Explorer's registry \
settings. Prevx Home can also protect the system against buffer overflow exploits.

Prevx Home's registry and buffer overflow protection feature is implemented by \
hooking several native APIs in kernel-space by modifying entries within the SDT \
ServiceTable. Hooking is performed by Prevx Home's kernel driver that replaces \
several entries within the SDT ServiceTable.

It is possible to disable Prevx Home's registry and buffer overflow protection by \
restoring the running kernel's SDT ServiceTable to its original state with direct \
writes to \device\physicalmemory. Restoring the  running kernel's SDT ServiceTable \
will effectively disable the protection offered by Prevx Home.  In other words, the \
registry keys that were protected by Prevx Home can now be modified

PATCH

Upgrade to Version 2.0, which can protect against such exploits.

WORKAROUNDS

Do not run untrusted programs as Administrator.

In-Reply-To: <20041122121935.25185.qmail@www.securityfocus.com>

Hi All,

Thanks to all at SIG^2 for the feedback regarding Prevx Home v1.0.  The version of \
software described in the advisory is no longer available for download, and as the \
advisory points out, the vulnerabilty is now resolved in v2.0. Most existing users \
will have had their software automatically upgraded, so this particularly issue is \
not likely to be a prevalent risk.

Prevx are commited in the fight against Cybercrime and to make the internet as safe \
for users as possible.  We appreciate any feedback on product improvement and greatly \
value the expertise and ideas contained in this forum.

Thanks again.

Kind regards,

Ralph Harvey
