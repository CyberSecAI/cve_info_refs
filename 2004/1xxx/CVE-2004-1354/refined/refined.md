Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Sun Management Console (SMC) webserver, running on Solaris 9, uses different 404 error messages depending on the reason the requested resource is not available. This occurs because the `sendError()` method is called differently depending on whether the file exists or not.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The webserver reveals whether a file exists or not on the target system based on the format of the 404 error message. If a file does not exist, the error message includes the filename. If a file exists, but access is denied, a generic 404 error is returned without the filename in the error response.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The webserver does not properly check for directory traversal using `..` sequences in the requested URL, allowing access to files outside the intended web root directory. The `serveDir()` and `serveFile()` functions access files based on the provided URL with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can probe the file system of the server and determine the existence of arbitrary files or directories. This information leakage can reveal valuable information about the system configuration and installed software.
*   By determining the existence of specific configuration files, the attacker can potentially gather sensitive information such as what services are running and user information.
*  The attacker can determine if services like X-Windows, r-services, ssh and NIS/yp are being utilized.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   HTTP requests to the SMC webserver on port 898.
*   Crafting URLs with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `http://yourhost:898/../../../../../tmp/.X11-unix`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target SMC server.
*   No authentication or special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable SMC webserver runs with root privileges.
*   The attacker can probe for the existence of a wide range of files on the server, limited only by the attacker's imagination, rather than being restricted to the web root.
