Security Bulletin

MPSB 04-05 Potential Risk in Dreamweaver Remote Database
Connectivity

Originally posted: April 1, 2004
Last updated: April 1, 2004
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Summary:

Dreamweaver's remote database connectivity for testing
dynamic database-driven websites installs scripts that
may reveal DSNs to outside attackers. A sophisticated
attacker may also be able to use these scripts to send
SQL commands to the server and gain control of the
database server.

~~~~~~~

Solution:

Customers should not define a database connection using
the driver on a testing server accessible to the public.
To prevent unauthorized access to the database, password-
protect the database. If a database connection has been
defined, use Dreamweaver's Remove Connection Scripts
menu command to remove the files that expose the database.
This issue is described in greater detail in Security
implications of remote database connectivity (TechNote
19214).

<http://www.macromedia.com/go/DMJL_AACE>

~~~~~~~

Severity Rating:

Macromedia categorizes this issue as a critical update
and recommends affected users immediately remove the
connection scripts from publicly accessible servers.

<http://www.macromedia.com/go/DMJL_AACF>

~~~~~~~

Affected Software Versions:

Dreamweaver MX 2004 (all versions)
Dreamweaver MX (all versions)
Dreamweaver UltraDev 4 (all versions)

~~~~~~~

Details:

When you specify "Using Driver On Testing Server" or
"Using DSN on Testing Server" in the database connections
dialog box, Dreamweaver automatically uploads a script
file to the testing server that allows Dreamweaver to
manipulate the remote database driver via the HTTP
protocol. This allows Dreamweaver to get the database
information it needs in order to help the user create
their site. However, this file does make it possible to
see the data source names (DSNs) defined on the system.
If the DSNs and databases are not password protected,
the script also enables an attacker to issue SQL commands
to the database.

~~~~~~~

Acknowledgements:

Macromedia would like to thank David Litchfield of Next
Generation Security Software Limited for reporting this
vulnerability and for working with us to help protect
our customers' security.

~~~~~~~

Revisions:

April 1, 2004, bulletin first created.

~~~~~~~

Reporting Security Issues:

Macromedia is committed to addressing security issues
and providing customers with the information on how they

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
