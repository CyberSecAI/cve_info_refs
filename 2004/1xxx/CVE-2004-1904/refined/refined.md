The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in Panda ActiveScan 5.0: a buffer overflow and a denial-of-service (DoS) crash.

**Vulnerability 1: Buffer Overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the "Internacional" property of the `ASControl.ReportHebrew.1` COM object.
*   **Weakness:** The `Internacional` property does not properly validate the length of the input string, allowing for a buffer overflow when a string longer than 255 characters is provided.
*   **Impact:** This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM level privileges.
*  **Attack Vector:** Exploitation can be performed remotely through a web browser using a specially crafted VBScript.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to create and interact with COM objects. Specifically, they need to be able to instantiate the vulnerable `ASControl.ReportHebrew.1` object and set its `Internacional` property using a script (VBScript in this case) executed through a web browser.

**Vulnerability 2: Denial of Service (DoS)**

*   **Root Cause:** A crash occurs when the `SetSitesFile` function of the `ASControls.InstallEngineCtl.1` COM object is called.
*   **Weakness:** The `SetSitesFile` function within the `ASControls.InstallEngineCtl.1` COM object is prone to crashing.
*   **Impact:** This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to crash the software, causing a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation can be performed remotely via a web browser by invoking the vulnerable function, `SetSitesFile`, with specific parameters.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to create and interact with COM objects, specifically, they need to instantiate `ASControls.InstallEngineCtl.1` and call `SetSitesFile`. This can be achieved using a script (VBScript in this case) executed through a web browser.
