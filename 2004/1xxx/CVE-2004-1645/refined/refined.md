Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2004-1645:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The Xedus webserver is unable to handle multiple connections from the same host.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The test scripts provided with Xedus do not properly sanitize user-supplied input.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The web server does not properly sanitize requests, allowing access to arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DoS:**  Inability to manage multiple connections from a single host, leading to service unavailability.
*   **XSS:** Lack of input sanitization in test scripts, enabling injection of malicious code.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Insufficient input validation allowing access to files outside the webroot.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **DoS:** An attacker can render a website inaccessible by overwhelming the server with connections.
*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious code into a victim's browser via the vulnerable scripts, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
*  **Directory Traversal:** An attacker can retrieve arbitrary files from the server, potentially including sensitive data like configuration files (boot.ini), log files, or password databases (sam).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **DoS:** Sending multiple requests from the same host.
*   **XSS:** Injecting malicious code into the vulnerable parameters within the test scripts URLs, like username or param.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Using "../" sequences within URLs to navigate the file system and access restricted files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **DoS:** The attacker needs to be able to send multiple HTTP requests to the server.
*   **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URL with malicious code to a user of the vulnerable website.
*  **Directory Traversal:** The attacker needs network access to the web server and the ability to send HTTP requests.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerable software is Xedus 1.0
*   The default port used by the webserver is 4274, but this can be changed by the administrator.
* The advisory suggests a solution of removing the sample .x files located in the ./sampledocs directory to prevent XSS attacks.
* The vendor was contacted but did not respond.
