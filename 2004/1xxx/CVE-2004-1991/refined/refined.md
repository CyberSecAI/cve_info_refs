The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in Aldo's Web Server version 1.5 on Windows:

**1) Physical Path Disclosure:**

*   **Root cause:** The server discloses the physical path of the web server's directory when any character is sent via Telnet/Netcat.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Information disclosure.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can learn the full path to the web server's directory on the file system.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending any character to the web server via Telnet/Netcat.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the server.

**2) Directory Traversal:**

*   **Root cause:** The web server does not properly validate user-supplied paths, allowing access to files outside of the webroot folder using relative paths.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Directory traversal.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can access arbitrary files on the server's file system, potentially including sensitive files such as configuration files, user data, etc.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the requested path via Telnet/Netcat.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the server.

The content provides more detailed technical information than the placeholder CVE description, such as the specific attack vector using Telnet/Netcat and example requests showing the directory traversal.
