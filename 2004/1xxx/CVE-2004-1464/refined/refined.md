{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Cisco IOS contains a vulnerability that allows specially crafted TCP packets sent to the telnet or reverse telnet service to cause the device to refuse subsequent connections to these management services.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of specially crafted TCP packets in the telnet and reverse telnet services."
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause a denial of service by preventing new connections to remote management services such as SSH, SCP, RSH, telnet, reverse telnet, and HTTP, effectively denying remote access to the device. Existing connections are not affected.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted TCP packets to the telnet (23/tcp) or reverse telnet (2001-2999/tcp, 3001-3099/tcp, 6001-6999/tcp, 7001-7099/tcp) ports."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send TCP packets to the vulnerable device's telnet or reverse telnet ports."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability affects Cisco IOS devices. The HTTP management interface using version 1.0 of the Cisco HTTP server (included in IOS versions prior to 12.2(15)) is also vulnerable. Version 1.1 of the Cisco HTTP server, included in IOS versions after and including 12.2(15), is not affected."
