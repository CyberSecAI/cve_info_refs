- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `texutil` script does not check if a file named `texutil.log` exists, nor if it is a symlink before opening and overwriting it. This occurs when the `--silent` option is used and output is redirected to `texutil.log`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Symlink vulnerability. The script blindly opens `texutil.log` for writing, without checking if it's a regular file or a symlink.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running the `texutil` script. This can lead to data corruption or complete system compromise, depending on which files are targeted.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must create a symlink named `texutil.log` in the working directory of the user running `texutil`, that points to a target file they wish to overwrite. Then, the attacker must persuade the user to run `texutil --silent`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must have write permissions in the working directory of the user who will execute `texutil`.
    - The attacker needs to convince or trick the user into running `texutil` with the `--silent` option.
