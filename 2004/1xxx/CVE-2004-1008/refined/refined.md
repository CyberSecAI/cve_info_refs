  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2004-1008",
      "root_cause": "PuTTY fails to do proper bounds checking on SSH2_MSG_DEBUG packets. The \"stringlen\" parameter value is incorrectly checked due to signedness issues.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Improper bounds checking",
        "Signedness issue"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can send specially crafted packets to the client, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running PuTTY. This is possible during the authentication process but before host key verification.",
      "attack_vector": "Sending specially crafted SSH2_MSG_DEBUG packets to the PuTTY client during the authentication process.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker controlling a malicious SSH server or performing a man-in-the-middle attack can send crafted packets.",
       "additional_details": "This vulnerability is similar to the one described in GLSA 200408-04 but is not the same."
