- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple buffer overflows in the Atari800 emulator.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflows in the Atari800 emulator program.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker could exploit the buffer overflows to gain root privileges because one of the affected programs is installed setuid root to access graphics hardware directly.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to a vulnerable system running Atari800.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to a system with the vulnerable Atari800 emulator installed.
