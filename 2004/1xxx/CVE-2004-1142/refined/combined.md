# Ethereal: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200412-15**

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Ethereal, which may allow an attacker to
run arbitrary code, crash the program or perform DoS by CPU and disk
utilization.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/ethereal** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.10.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.10.8** |

### Background

Ethereal is a feature rich network protocol analyzer.

### Description

There are multiple vulnerabilities in versions of Ethereal earlier
than 0.10.8, including:

* Bug in DICOM dissection
  discovered by Bing could make Ethereal crash (CAN 2004-1139).
* An invalid RTP timestamp could make Ethereal hang and create a
  large temporary file (CAN 2004-1140).
* The HTTP dissector could
  access previously-freed memory (CAN 2004-1141).
* Brian Caswell
  discovered that an improperly formatted SMB could make Ethereal hang
  (CAN 2004-1142).

### Impact

An attacker might be able to use these vulnerabilities to crash
Ethereal, perform DoS by CPU and disk space utilization or even execute
arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running Ethereal, which
could be the root user.

### Workaround

For a temporary workaround you can disable all affected protocol
dissectors by selecting Analyze->Enabled Protocols... and deselecting
them from the list. However, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to
the latest stable version.

### Resolution

All ethereal users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.10.8"
```
