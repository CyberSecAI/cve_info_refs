There is some kind of major bug in prozilla that allows one to get control over a linux box.  There is this guy on IRC that tell people to download a file from a server, to "test" something - the next thing that happens, he has control over the box. If one has installed grsec - prozilla segfaults.  I'm looking at the code of prozilla, but see nothing. Pleas help.

I've already found a few array bounds checking bugs, though not as yet exploitable by anyone but the user (by passing an over-long URL at the command line, he can execute code as himself--woohoo!).   I'm looking over it a bit now.  ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Dan Margolis (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-04 21:57:18 UTC  ``` Looks like similar vulnerable code to that rootshell found already in http-retr.c, lines 360 and 192. Also in ftpsearch.c and probably other places (ftp-retr.c, probably).   Basically, if one can set the urlinfo u->file variable that gets passed around, one can take advantage of an assumed maximum file length in a very large number of functions, including those in logfile.c, main.c's ftp_allocate_connections, http_allocate_connections, query_resume_old_download, and pretty much any other place that prints u->file into a buffer of length MAXPATHLEN.   Florian, am I right in understanding that the permanent-move directive allows a malicious server to set this variable to a length larger than MAXPATHLEN? If so, patching will hardly be trivial, though fortunately the code is consistent enough that tracking down most vulns should be easy enough.   If any of this is incoherent, it's lack of sleep. I'll try to do something about this tomorrow (the bug, not my lack of sleep).  ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Florian Schilhabel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-05 02:42:29 UTC  ``` hi, yes, you are right the function to build the actual request is called from the commandline (commandline overflow) and if the server gives a permanently moved, the new GET / HEAD request is constructed using the same function. thats basically, why this thing is remote exploitable... one personal note: i looked at the code yesterday for only about 20 minutes; it was ~23:00 hrs... this application is _not_ coded with security in mind... it lacks bounds checking all over the place... krispy: i will look over the code a little; will you please post offending code you found here in bugzilla? i will do the same...  best regards florian [rootshell]   ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Florian Schilhabel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-05 03:50:29 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 43329](attachment.cgi?id=43329 "...the first diff....") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=43329&action=edit "...the first diff...."), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=43329&action=diff "...the first diff....")] ...the first diff....  this is the first diff. just what i found yesterday. at least, prozilla doesn't segfault any more with the evil_server.pl...  more to come... best regards florian [rootshell] ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Dan Margolis (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-05 09:46:03 UTC  ``` Following some discussion on IRC, Florian and I agree that providing a comprehensive set of fixes for a problem that is spread throughout this code, or, really, being able to provide any assurance of having fixed this, would be pretty time-consuming. Given that prozilla doesn't, as far as I can tell, provide anything that any other downloader doesn't, and given that according to the website development's been dead for 2 years, I say we issue a GLSA and hard-mask it in portage. If the upstream or package maintainer want to fix it, that'd be great, but it doesn't seem worth the effort for us to go about this ourselves.  ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Robert Muchacki (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-05 09:54:56 UTC  ``` I sure do agree. There is to much of patching and stuff. It'll be better just to write it from the beggining :)  Hardmask it and get rid of it :/  I suggest to check if it isn't in /etc/make.conf.example as one of the examples for a downloader instead of wget... ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Dan Margolis (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-05 10:08:57 UTC  ``` Re: [Comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=70090#c10), it doesn't seem to be in mine.  ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-05 11:44:40 UTC  ``` If it's a mess, masking may be the only solution.  I don't like publishing masking GLSAs too much, it shows we don't know how/want to patch things like other distribution do. However, masking without issuing a GLSA does not warn existing users... maybe publishing only to gentoo-announce ? ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Dan Margolis (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-05 12:24:09 UTC  ``` I've emailed the upstream maintainer to see if he wants to fix it. Depending on his response, we can either mask it or update it. Metadata is missing, so I don't knoww who the Gentoo package maintainer is...  Koon, Re: [Comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=70090#c12), I don't think it's fair to not make the GLSA as public as possible. PR should not stand in the way of security, and it's beneficial not just to our users but to other users of prozilla to see this. If some other distro is willing to patch prozilla, we can use their patch, but if not, they're going to be masking it just as we are.   Alternatively, tell the other distros in advance, see if one of them will patch it, and get their patch :P ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Chris White (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-05 22:01:39 UTC  ``` Looking at this bug in greater detail.  I'll be taking care of getting it allllllllllll patched :P. ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Robert Muchacki (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-21 10:52:36 UTC  ``` Any progress with this bug? It is still vulnerable - and there is no GLSA out about this... Maybe make a move? ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-21 11:05:38 UTC  ``` Re [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=70090#c15)  We don't issue GLSA's for things that have not been fixed. ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Robert Muchacki (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-21 11:34:43 UTC  ``` That's what I'm talking about - is there any progress with this?  If it will last long, I suggest to hard-mask it until it is fixed (atleast). ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-21 13:55:15 UTC  ``` There is an exploitable and maybe exploited vuln in there, so switching to Vulnerability component.  Chris said he would look into providing a complete set of fixes, but it's taking time. So I would say we should mask the package and issue a GLSA about it.  Re: [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=70090#c12), Krispy, any answer from upstream ? ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Dan Margolis (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-21 18:00:50 UTC  ``` Koon: I was [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=70090#c13) :P. I said mask from the beginning. No comment from upstream, and if ChrisWhite wants to fix, great, but it'll probably take him some time (track him down and ask, if you want, though).  ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-22 09:43:51 UTC  ``` # <solar@gentoo.org> (22 Nov 2004) # www-client/prozilla: multiple vulnerabilities [bug #70090](show_bug.cgi?id=70090 "RESOLVED FIXED - www-client/prozilla: multiple vulnerabilities -> Remove from tree") # Security masked and will probably be removed. www-client/prozilla  ```  [Comment 21](#c21)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-22 14:40:03 UTC  ``` Email sent to vendor-sec.

The exploit got released with a note to another bug in the code.   Well the 31337 Gent00 Security Team claimed to have audited the code   and put Prozilla back to portage as fixed.    The buffer overflow has been fixed (wow what an effort) but the other   bug is still there!    Well this either means they dont know what format string bugs are and   how to spot them (maybe you should better use automated t00lz,if you cant   do it yourself, as they would have spotted it for sure :P), or they   simply are lazy and dont give a fuck about your security.    We support Anti-Disclosure, but this bug isnt of much use anymore and we   feel like people should know that they better audit code themselfes before   trusting a Gentoo security fix. Even a automated audit application   would have done a better job.    Hey Gentoo, maybe you should try and enlighten yourself about   format bugs, instead of pretending :P    But then again, if everyone would audit as g00d as you guys, we'd   have a lot more fun ;) - - -  <http://www.securiteam.com/exploits/5WP082KEUW.html> ```  [Comment 39](#c39)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-09 13:12:05 UTC  ``` Masked again...

# ProZilla: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200411-31**

ProZilla contains several buffer overflow vulnerabilities that can be
exploited by a malicious server to execute arbitrary code with the rights
of the user running ProZilla.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/prozilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.3.7.3** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

ProZilla is a download accelerator for Linux.

### Description

ProZilla contains several exploitable buffer overflows in the code
handling the network protocols.

### Impact

A remote attacker could setup a malicious server and entice a user to
retrieve files from that server using ProZilla. This could lead to the
execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the user running
ProZilla.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Currently, there is no released version of ProZilla that contains a fix
for these issues. The original author did not respond to our queries,
the code contains several other problems and more secure alternatives
exist. Therefore, the ProZilla package has been hard-masked prior to
complete removal from Portage, and current users are advised to unmerge
the package.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 663-1                     security@debian.org

Package        : prozilla
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-1120
BugTraq ID     : 11734

Several buffer overflows have been discovered in prozilla, a
multi-threaded download accelerator which could be exploited by a
remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.  An
exploit for prozilla is already in the wild.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.6-3woody1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.7.3-1

We recommend that you upgrade your prozilla package.
