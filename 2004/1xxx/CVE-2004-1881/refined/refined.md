Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described in the S-Quadra advisory:

**Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The `strItems` parameter in `mailorder.asp` and `payonline.asp` is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization. Specifically, the application fails to prevent SQL injection via the `strItems` parameter.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server. Specifically, the advisory mentions that an attacker can use `xp_cmdshell` to execute system commands on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to either `mailorder.asp` or `payonline.asp` with a malicious `strItems` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application. They do not need to be authenticated.

**Vulnerability 2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `strImageTag` parameter in `largeimage.asp` is not properly sanitized, allowing arbitrary Javascript code injection.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization of the `strImageTag` parameter.
*  **Impact**: Attackers can steal user session IDs and gain access to user personal data.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting a malicious URL with injected JavaScript code in the `strImageTag` parameter and tricking a user into visiting this URL.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into visiting a crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor attempted to fix these vulnerabilities by escaping single quotes and removing HTML tags, but these fixes were ineffective as demonstrated by new Proof-of-Concept code.
*   The advisory provides detailed PoC code for both SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
*   The advisory highlights the vendor's failure to address the vulnerabilities effectively after initial reports.
