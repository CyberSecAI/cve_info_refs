- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability due to improper input sanitization in the Advanced Guestbook 2.2 web application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the username field is vulnerable, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can gain administrator access by injecting SQL code into the password field during login, bypassing authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed via a crafted password string entered during login, leaving the username field blank.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the Advanced Guestbook 2.2 web application.
