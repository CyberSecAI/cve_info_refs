- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the code handling digest authentication within Pavuk.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Pavuk.
- **Attack vectors**: Not explicitly stated, but implied to be triggered via the digest authentication mechanism, likely a remote vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to trigger the digest authentication process with carefully crafted input that causes a buffer overflow, likely by interacting with the vulnerable Pavuk service remotely.
