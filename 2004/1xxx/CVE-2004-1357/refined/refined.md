        "source": "secunia.com_7a4c17d1_20250125_213642.html",
        "analysis": "This document is about Secunia Research and its vulnerability intelligence, but it does not contain information related to the vulnerability described in CVE-2004-1357. Therefore it is UNRELATED."

        "analysis": {
          "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the way the SSH daemon interprets the `ListenAddress` configuration in the `sshd_config` file.",
          "weaknesses": [
            "Incorrect logging of client IP addresses.",
            "Specific configuration of the `ListenAddress` keyword ('0.0.0.0') triggers the issue."
          ],
          "impact": "The SSH daemon logs all-zeroes instead of the correct client IP address. This makes it difficult to identify and track clients connecting to the service based on log files.",
          "attack_vectors": "The attack vector isn't through exploitation, but rather through the misconfiguration of the `ListenAddress` setting. This could affect log analysis.",
          "required_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are required. The vulnerability is a result of a specific server configuration."
