How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Sun Solaris SSH Daemon fails to properly log client IP addresses

#### Vulnerability Note VU#737548

Original Release Date: 2004-04-14 | Last Revised: 2004-04-14

---

### Overview

The Sun Solaris Secure Shell Daemon (sshd) may incorrectly log client IP addresses.

### Description

| SSH is a program used to provide secure connection and communications between client and servers. Upon connecting to the service, the client's IP address is logged. There is a vulnerability in the Sun Solaris SSH Daemon that may cause it to inaccurately log the IP addresses of clients. When the SSH Daemon initializes, it reads configuration information from the sshd\_config file. If this file contains the "ListenAddress" keyword configured in a specific way, SSH will fail to properly log client IP addresses.  According to the [Sun Security Advisory](http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fsalert/57538):*A system is only affected by this issue if the sshd configuration file (sshd\_config(4)) has the "ListenAddress" keyword configured as "0.0.0.0" which means to listen on only IPv4 (see inet(3SOCKET)) configured interfaces.**To determine which interfaces on a system are configured to use IPv4 the following command can be run:*$ ifconfig -a4lo0: flags=1000849<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST,IPv4> mtu 8232 index 1   inet 127.0.0.1 netmask ff000000 eri0: flags=1000843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST,IPv4> mtu 1400 index 2  inet 192.168.254.202 netmask ffffff00 broadcast 192.168.254.255 |
| --- |

### Impact

| The IP address logged by the SSH Daemon will contain all zeroes rather than the correct IP address of the client. Therefore, when reviewing the log files, system administrators may not be able to accurately identify clients who have connected to the service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply patch**Sun has released an advisory which addresses this issue. For more information on patches available for your system, please refer to [Sun Security Alert: 57538](http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fsalert/57538). |
| --- |

| **Edit configuration file**According to the [Sun Security Advisory](http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fsalert/57538), the following workaround could be used to mitigate against this vulnerability:*For sites which are utilizing both IPv4 and IPv6 (see inet(3SOCKET)) network interfaces, to prevent this issue from occurring the sshd\_config(4) file can be edited to listen on both IPv4 and IPv6 configured interfaces by setting the "ListenAddress" keyword to contain two colons (::). For example:*   $ grep ^ListenAddress /etc/ssh/sshd\_configListenAddress ::                   *If the sshd\_config(4) file is modified, the sshd daemon needs to be sent a SIGHUP signal to re-read the file. For example, as the root user:*  # pkill -HUP sshd |
