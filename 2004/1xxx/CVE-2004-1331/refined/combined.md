How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft Internet Explorer execCommand() method SaveAs command uses misleading "Save HTML Document" dialog

#### Vulnerability Note VU#743974

Original Release Date: 2004-12-17 | Last Revised: 2004-12-17

---

### Overview

Microsoft Internet Explorer contains a vulnerability in the way that it presents a Save As dialog. By invoking the SaveAs command with execCommand, an attacker could display a dialog that could trick a user into saving arbitrary content.

### Description

| Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) supports a proprietary DHTML command called [SaveAs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/constants/saveas.asp), which saves the current document to a file. SaveAs is invoked by the execCommand method and can save any data that is displayed within the browser to a file. By setting the value of the appropriate SaveAs paramater, the full path and filename (including extension) can be specified.  Normally, the SaveAs command is used to save HTML documents. However, any file that can be displayed in a browser window can be saved to a file by the SaveAs command. Certain combinations of file extension and/or server-provided MIME type will cause IE to display binary data within the browser window. In such cases, SaveAs can be used to save an executable file to the local filesystem. The data to be saved could be contained within a hidden FRAME or IFRAME element.The dialog presented by the SaveAs command has the following characteristics that facilitate an attacker's ability to deceive the user:   1. The "Save as type" field of the dialog always displays "HTML File (\*.htm; \*.html)," regardless of the content that it is actually saving. 2. Although the "Save as type" field indicates that it is saving an HTML file, it does not save a file with a .htm or .html extension.  The default configuration for Windows is to hide the file extension for known file types. With file extensions hidden, a file called "file.html.exe" on the filesystem will appear as "file.html" in the save dialog and also in Windows Explorer.When downloading a file with Windows XP SP2, the user is normally presented with a dialog titled "File Download - Security Warning." When the SaveAs command is used to save a file, this security dialog is bypassed. In addition, Windows XP SP2 normally stores the zone information about downloaded files in an NTFS Alternate Data Stream. This is known as a [Persistent Zone Identifier](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/security/szone/reference/objects/PersistentZoneIdentifier.asp). Files saved with the SaveAs command do not contain this zone information. This means that the user will not be presented with the security warning dialog when an application saved with the SaveAs command is executed. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker could convince a user to save an arbitrary file to a specific location on the local filesystem. This file could appear to be an HTML document, when it actually is an executable file. |
| --- |

### Solution

|  |
| --- |

| **Disable Active scripting**Disabling Active scripting prevents execCommand from running. As a result, the SaveAs command will not execute, thus preventing the spoofed save dialog. Instructions for disabling Active scripting can be found in the [Malicious Web Scripts FAQ](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_FAQ.html#ie56). Note that disabling Active scripting will reduce the functionality of many web sites.**Disable "Hide extensions for known file types"**The default configuration for Windows is to hide the extensions for known file types. An attacker can take advantage of this by creating a file with double extensions. For example, "file.html.exe" will appear as "file.html" by default. This can allow executable files to masquerade as less dangerous file types. Configure Windows Explorer to [show all file extensions](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307859#3). Displaying the actual file extension will make it easier to understand what type of file is being saved. |

playing for fun with <=IE7
Impact: who knows ...
Fix Available: no
-------------------------------------------------------
1) Bug
2) Proof of concept
3)Conclusion
======
1) Bug
======
it's possible to bypass the extension filter of <=IE7 this can result by
downloading
an arbitrary exe file
=====
2)proof of concept
=====
let's take this exemple :
http://dams083.free.fr/tmp/putty.exe
this is simply putty .
you click on this and then you will be prompted for downloading the file.
but what about if we do :
http://dams083.free.fr/tmp/putty.exe?1.txt
... the .exe is showed.
now let's go a bit ahead :
http://dams083.free.fr/tmp/putty.exe?1.cda
wow my .exe is downloaded directly and located in temporary files ( and
"""opened""" by windows media player).
works with theses extension :
.log
.dif
.sol
.htt
.itpc
.itms
.dvr-ms
.dib
.asf
.tif
etc ...
=====
5) Conclusion
=====
this is very funny , because actually it only works for .exe extensions.
.COM , .PIF , etc you CANT do this. ( overwrite the extension , and then
bypass the filter)
i guess we can wonder what the heck.
