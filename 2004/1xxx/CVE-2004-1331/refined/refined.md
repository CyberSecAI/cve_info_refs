Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2004-1331

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Internet Explorer's `execCommand()` method with the `SaveAs` command handles file saving. It uses a misleading dialog that can trick users into saving arbitrary content, including executables, under the guise of an HTML file. This is further exacerbated by Windows' default setting to hide file extensions for known file types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Misleading "Save As" Dialog:** The dialog box always displays "HTML File (*.htm; *.html)" in the "Save as type" field, regardless of the actual file type being saved.
*   **Bypassing Security Warnings:**  When saving a file using the `SaveAs` command, the "File Download - Security Warning" dialog is bypassed in Windows XP SP2.
*   **Missing Zone Information:** Files saved using the `SaveAs` command lack the Persistent Zone Identifier (NTFS Alternate Data Stream), which would normally trigger a security warning upon execution.
*  **Extension filter bypass:** It's possible to bypass the extension filter by appending "?1.txt" or similar to the end of the URL of the file to be downloaded, forcing the browser to download the file without the security checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can trick a user into saving an executable file onto their local system, disguising it as a harmless HTML file. Once saved, the user might unknowingly execute the malicious file, leading to compromise. The lack of zone information further aids in the execution of the file without security warnings.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can embed malicious code within a webpage that leverages the vulnerable `SaveAs` command.
*   **Hidden IFRAME/FRAME:** The data to be saved could be hidden inside a FRAME or IFRAME, so the user is not even aware of the download.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host a webpage:** An attacker needs the ability to host a webpage that could be accessed by the victim.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker must know how to exploit the `execCommand` and `SaveAs` method within Internet Explorer and how the browser will behave.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious webpage.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered through the use of the `SaveAs` command within the `execCommand` function in Microsoft Internet Explorer.
*   The issue is compounded by the default Windows setting of hiding extensions for known file types, which allows an attacker to create files with double extensions (e.g., "file.html.exe" appearing as "file.html").
*   The vulnerability is present in Internet Explorer versions up to and including IE7.
*   The issue can also be triggered by appending extensions such as `.log`, `.dif`, `.sol`, `.htt`, `.itpc`, `.itms`, `.dvr-ms`, `.dib`, `.asf`, `.tif`, etc, to the end of the file name.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by:
*   Disabling Active Scripting in Internet Explorer.
*   Configuring Windows Explorer to show all file extensions.

**CVSS Score:** Base Score 2.6/10, Impact Subscore: 2.9/10, Exploitability Subscore: 4.9/10, Remote exploit range, High complexity.
