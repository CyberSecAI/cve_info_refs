Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2004-1189:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `add_to_history()` function in the `src/lib/kadm5/srv/svr_principal.c` file of the MIT Kerberos 5 administration library (`libkadm5srv`).
*   The password history is managed as a ring buffer (`adb->old_keys`). The code uses `adb->old_key_next` as an index and `adb->old_key_len` as the array length.
*   The vulnerability occurs due to improper handling of password history counts during password changes. Specifically, when the password history count (`pol->pw_hist_num`) is reduced after a password change that causes the index `adb->old_key_next` to point past the end of the array, a subsequent password change can trigger a heap buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap buffer overflow:** The `add_to_history()` function writes password history data beyond the allocated buffer when the index goes out of bounds.
*   **Improper handling of password history:** The code fails to correctly resize the password history buffer in certain scenarios. Specifically, when a password policy's history count is reduced.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Successful exploitation can allow an authenticated user (not necessarily an administrator) to execute arbitrary code on the Key Distribution Center (KDC) host.
*   **Kerberos realm compromise:** This could lead to the compromise of the entire Kerberos realm.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by an authenticated user changing their password under specific circumstances.
*   An administrator must have changed the password policy in a specific way for the vulnerability to be exposed for a given principal:
    * The user must have changed their password fewer times than the history count in their password policy.
    *  The user's password policy's history count must be subsequently reduced to equal the number of times the password was changed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated Kerberos user.
*   The attacker does not necessarily need to have administrative privileges.
*   The KDC must be in a vulnerable state, as described above.
