> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

===========================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-58-1		   January 10, 2005
krb5 vulnerability
CAN-2004-1189
===========================================================

A security issue affects the following Ubuntu releases:

Ubuntu 4.10 (Warty Warthog)

The following packages are affected:

krb5-admin-server
krb5-kdc
libkadm55
libkrb53

The problem can be corrected by upgrading the affected package to
version 1.3.4-3ubuntu0.1.  In general, a standard system upgrade is
sufficient to effect the necessary changes.

Details follow:

Michael Tautschnig discovered a possible buffer overflow in the
add_to_history() function in the MIT Kerberos 5 implementation.
Performing a password change did not properly track the password
policy's history count and the maximum number of keys. This could
cause an array overflow and may have allowed authenticated users (not
necessarily one with administrative privileges) to execute arbitrary
code on the KDC host, compromising an entire Kerberos realm.

MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2004-004
Original release: 2004-12-20
Topic: heap buffer overflow in libkadm5srv
Severity: serious
SUMMARY
=======
The MIT Kerberos 5 administration library (libkadm5srv) contains a
heap buffer overflow in password history handling code which could be
exploited to execute arbitrary code on a Key Distribution Center (KDC)
host. The overflow occurs during a password change of a principal
with a certain password history state. An administrator must have
performed a certain password policy change in order to create the
vulnerable state. (See MITIGATING FACTORS below.)
No exploits are known to exist at this time, though a public
discussion of the bug took place during the first weeks of December
2004, containing sufficient detail that someone could infer how to
perform an attack. Exploitation of this vulnerability is believed to
be difficult, due to the limited extent of the overflow.
IMPACT
======
An authenticated user, not necessarily one with administrative
privileges, could execute arbitrary code on the KDC host, compromising
an entire Kerberos realm. [CAN-2004-1189]
MITIGATING FACTORS
==================
\* Typically, only a principal satisfying the following conditions can
trigger the buffer overflow upon password change:
+ have changed its password fewer times than the history count in
its password policy
+ had its password policy's history count subsequently reduced to
equal the number of times it has changed its password
\* There are other means of producing the vulnerable state, though they
are significantly more complex and much less likely. All of these
other methods involve a reduction of the password history count in a
password policy.
\* A workaround exists (see FIXES).
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
\* KDC software on all releases of MIT krb5, up to and including
krb5-1.3.5. The vulnerable library is libkadm5srv. Programs which
use the vulnerable functionality of the library include:
+ kadmind (administration daemon)
+ kadmin.local (KDC-local administration client)
+ kadmind4 (krb4 compatibility administration daemon)
FIXES
=====
\* WORKAROUND: Until your KDC programs and libraries have been patched,
do not decrease the password history count on any policy in your
Kerberos realm. Also, if you have already decreased the password
history count on a policy at some point in the past, you should
raise it to the maximum value that it has had in the past.
\* The upcoming krb5-1.4 release (currently in beta test) will contain
fixes for this problem. The krb5-1.4-beta3 release contains fixes
for this problem.
\* The upcoming krb5-1.3.6 patch release contains fixes for this
problem.
\* Apply the following patch to src/lib/kadm5/srv/svr\_principal.c, and
recompile the affected libraries and binaries. This patch was
generated against krb5-1.3.5, and may apply, with some offset, to
earlier releases.

Thanks to Michael Tautschnig for reporting this problem.
Thanks to Chaskiel Grundman and Luke Howard for providing debugging

DETAILS
=======
The vulnerable function is add\_to\_history() in
src/lib/kadm5/srv/svr\_principal.c. The password history is stored as
a ring buffer, represented as an array of osa\_pw\_ent\_rec, which is
adb->old\_keys. The "next" pointer is an index into the array,
adb->old\_key\_next, and the length of the array is stored in
adb->old\_key\_len. The array is dynamically resized as needed, and
there is no separate head pointer.
The policy's history count is stored in pol->pw\_hist\_num, but the
actual maximum number of keys stored in adb->old\_keys is
pol->pw\_hist\_num-1, since the "current" key data are also used for
history comparisons when a password change occurs.
The index value adb->old\_key\_next is permitted to index to a position
one past the end of the array adb->old\_keys if adb->old\_key\_next is
less than pol->pw\_hist\_num-1. This out-of-bounds indexing is usually
fixed up when add\_to\_history() enlarges the array on a subsequent
call.
If pol->pw\_hist\_num is reduced to adb->old\_key\_next after a password
change that causes adb->old\_key\_next to index out of bounds, a
subsequent password change will not run the resizing code, and
add\_to\_history() will write a password history entry past the end of
the array adb->old\_keys.
