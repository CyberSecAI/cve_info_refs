The content is related to CVE-2004-1622.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  SQL injection in the `dosearch.php` file of UBB.threads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `dosearch.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `Name` parameter. Specifically, the `Name` parameter is used in a SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or complete compromise of the database. In this specific case, the attacker can select user accounts using a known password hash.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, through the `dosearch.php` script via the `Name` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs no special capabilities, only a web browser, and knowledge of the vulnerable URL and SQL syntax. The attacker is an unauthenticated remote user.
