## Vulnerabilities:

### News Manager Lite 2.5
**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
- **Root cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in the generated HTML.
- **Weakness:** Lack of input validation and output encoding.
- **Attack vector:** HTTP GET requests.
- **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML and script code into web pages, which can then be executed in the client's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Examples:**
    - `http://[host]/comment_add.asp?ID=3&email=[XSS]`
    - `http://[host]/search.asp?search=[XSS]`
    - `http://[host]/category_news_headline.asp?ID=2&n=[XSS]`

**SQL Injection:**
- **Root cause:** The application constructs SQL queries using unsanitized user input.
- **Weakness:** Lack of input validation and prepared statements/parameterized queries.
- **Attack vector:** HTTP GET requests.
- **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database queries, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive data, modification of data, or even complete database takeover.
- **Examples:**
    - `http://[host]/more.asp?ID='[SQL query]`
    - `http://[host]/category_news.asp?ID='[SQL]`
    - `http://[host]/news_sort.asp?filter='[SQL]`

### News Manager Lite administration
**Cookie Account Hijack:**
- **Root cause:** The application uses a predictable cookie format for authentication that is vulnerable to modification.
-   **Weakness:** Insecure session management.
- **Attack vector:** Cookie manipulation.
-   **Impact:** An attacker can gain administrative access by modifying the authentication cookie.
- **Example:**
  -   `Cookie: NEWS%5FLOGIN=ADMIN=1&ID=1`
