  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes files based on user-controlled input without proper sanitization, and global variables are overwritten due to insecure handling of HTTP GET, POST, and COOKIE variables.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Global variable overwriting",
      "Configuration file destruction"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, overwrite global variables to manipulate application behavior, including database prefixes for SQL injection, and overwrite the configuration file to disrupt the site.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Manipulating the `user_langue` parameter in the URL to include arbitrary local files.",
      "Using GET, POST or COOKIE variables to overwrite existing global variables.",
        "Using the update.php to overwrite the configuration file."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and can manipulate the URL of the vulnerable application."

    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input validation allows inclusion of arbitrary files via `user_langue` parameter and insecure global variable handling in `nk_globals` function, and configuration file overwriting through `update.php`.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Local File Inclusion via `user_langue` parameter.",
      "Global variable overwriting via HTTP GET/POST/COOKIE variables due to flawed `nk_globals` function.",
      "Configuration file manipulation through `update.php` with vulnerable parameters.",
       "SQL Injection via overwritten `$nuked[prefix]` variable."

    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary local file inclusion, overwriting of critical global variables like database prefix allowing SQL injection, potential for full site compromise including the ability to create admin accounts, and configuration file modification leading to site disruption or complete takeover.",
        "Attack vectors": [
      "Manipulating `user_langue` parameter to include files like `globals.php` and local files on the server.",

          "Exploiting `update.php` to overwrite the configuration file with malicious parameters."
