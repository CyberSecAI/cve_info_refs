How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) replication protocol contains a heap-based buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#145134

Original Release Date: 2004-11-29 | Last Revised: 2004-12-17

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) replication protocol may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| The Microsoft [WINS](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/proddocs/entserver/sag_WINS_ovr_WhatIs.asp) service maps IP addresses to NETBIOS computer names. WINS servers share information via a server-to-server replication protocol that operates on TCP port 42. Connection information for replication peers is stored in a data structure called the association context. Insufficient validation of the buffer where the association context data structure is written allows a heap-based buffer overflow to occur. If a remote attacker supplies a specially crafted replication packet to a vulnerable WINS server, that attacker may be able to exploit the buffer overflow to write arbitrary data to WINS server process memory.  According to Microsoft Knowledge Base Article[890710](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/890710):   *This security issue affects Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server, Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, Windows 2000 Server, and Windows Server 2003. Windows 2000 Professional, Windows XP and Windows Millennium Edition (ME) are not affected by this vulnerability.* *By default, WINS is not installed on Windows NT Server 4.0, Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, Windows 2000 Server, or Windows Server 2003. By default, WINS is installed and running on Microsoft Small Business Server 2000 and Microsoft Windows Small Business Server 2003. By default, on all versions of Microsoft Small Business Server, the WINS component communication ports are blocked from the Internet, and WINS is available only on the local network.* In addition, since the replication only occurs between servers, only WINS servers are vulnerable. WINS clients are not affected by this vulnerability.Please refer to Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-045](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-045.mspx) for more information regarding this vulnerability and its remediation. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges or cause a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**  Microsoft has released Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-045](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-045.mspx) to address this issue. |
| --- |

| **Consider Workarounds in MS04-045**       + Removing the WINS service if it is not needed + Blocking TCP and UDP port 42 + Using IPSec as a communication protocol between WINS servers  For more detailed information please see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [890710](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/890710) and Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-045](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-045.mspx). |

## Vulnerability Details

#### Name Validation Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0567:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in WINS because of the way that it handles computer name validation. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious network packet that could potentially allow remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Name Validation Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0567:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* By default, WINS is not installed on Windows NT Server 4.0, on Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, on Windows 2000 Server, or on Windows Server 2003. By default, WINS is installed and running on Microsoft Small Business Server 2000 and on Microsoft Windows Small Business Server 2003.
  However, by default, on all versions of Microsoft Small Business Server, the WINS component communication ports are blocked from the Internet and WINS is available only on the local network.
* On Windows Server 2003, attempts to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in a denial of service. The WINS service automatically restarts if it fails. After the third automatic restart, WINS requires a manual restart to restore functionality.

#### Workarounds for Name Validation Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0567:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Block TCP port 42 and UDP port 42 at your firewall.**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with a remote WINS server. Blocking these ports at the firewall will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from being attacked by attempts to exploit this vulnerability. It is possible that other ports may be found that could be used to exploit this vulnerability. The ports that are listed are the most common attack vectors. We recommend blocking all inbound unsolicited communication from the Internet.
* **Remove WINS if you do not need it.**

  In many organizations, WINS only provides services for legacy systems. If WINS is no longer needed, you could remove it by following this procedure. These steps apply only to Windows 2000 and later versions. For Windows NT 4.0, follow the procedure that is included in the product documentation.

  To configure WINS components and services:

  1. Click Start, and then click Control Panel, open **Add or Remove Programs**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Add or Remove Programs**.
  3. Click **Add/Remove Windows Components**.
  4. On the Windows Components Wizard page, under **Components**, click **Networking Services**, and then click **Details**.
  5. Click to clear the **Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS)** check box to remove WINS.
  6. Complete the Windows Components Wizard by following the instructions on the screen.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Many organizations require WINS to perform name registration and name resolution functions on their network. Administrators should not remove WINS unless they fully understand the affect that doing this will have on their network. For more information about WINS, see the [WINS product documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21455). Also, if an administrator is removing the WINS functionality from a server that will continue to provide shared resources on the network, the administrator must correctly reconfigure the system to use the remaining name resolution services within the local network. For more information about WINS visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windowsserv/2003/enterprise/proddocs/default.asp?url=/resources/documentation/windowsserv/2003/enterprise/proddocs/sag_wins_ovr_whatis.asp). For more information about how to determine if you need NETBIOS or WINS name resolution and DNS configuration, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/library/depkit/55f0dfc8-afc9-4096-82f4-b8345eaa1dbd.mspx).
* **On Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003, use IPSec communication to secure traffic between WINS server replication partners.**

  Use Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. For detailed information about how to use IPSec to help protect WINS from this issue, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 890710](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/890710).
  Detailed information about IPSec and how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).

  **Impact of Workaround:** If you set up IPSec incorrectly, you may cause serious WINS replication problems on your corporate network. For additional information about IPSec security considerations, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/sag_ipsecsec_con.mspx).

#### FAQ for Name Validation Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0567:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges.
On Windows Server 2003, the most likely attack scenario is a [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142). An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause WINS to fail on Windows Server 2003. On Windows Server 2003, WINS restarts automatically when it fails. After the third automatic restart, WINS requires a manual restart to restore functionality. Restarting WINS allows the service to function correctly. However, WINS could remain vulnerable to another denial of service attack.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the method that WINS uses to validate the Name value in a specially-crafted packet.
The possibility of a denial of service on Windows Server 2003 results from the presence of a security feature that was used in the development of Windows Server 2003. This security feature detects when an attempt is made to exploit a stack-based buffer overrun and reduces the chance that it can be easily exploited. This security feature can be forced to terminate the service to prevent malicious code execution. On Windows Server 2003, when an attempt is made to exploit the buffer overrun, the security feature reacts and terminates the service. This results in a denial of service condition of WINS. Because it is possible that methods may be found in the future to bypass this security feature, which could then enable code execution, customers should apply the update. For more information about these security features, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21535).

**What is the Windows Internet Naming Service?**

The Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) maps IP addresses to NetBIOS computer names and vice versa. By using WINS servers, individuals can search for resources by computer name instead of by IP address. The benefits of WINS include the following:

* Reduces NetBIOS-based broadcast traffic on subnets by permitting clients to query WINS servers to locate remote systems.
* Supports earlier Windows and NetBIOS-based clients on the network by permitting them to browse lists for remote Windows domains without requiring a local domain controller on each subnet.
* Supports Domain Name System (DNS)-based clients by enabling those clients to locate NetBIOS resources when WINS lookup integration is implemented.

For more information about WINS, see the [WINS product documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21455).

**How do I know if I use WINS on my server?**

By default, WINS is not installed on Windows NT Server 4.0, on Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, on Windows 2000 Server, or on Windows Server 2003. By default, WINS is installed and running on Microsoft Small Business Server 2000 and on Microsoft Windows Small Business Server 2003. You can determine if WINS is installed by following this procedure. These steps apply only to Windows 2000 and later versions. For Windows NT 4.0, follow the procedure that is included in the product documentation.

To verify WINS components and services:

1. Click Start, and then click Control Panel, open **Add or Remove Programs**.
2. In the default Category View, click **Add or Remove Programs**.
3. Click **Add/Remove Windows Components**.
4. On the Windows Components Wizard page, under **Components**, click **Networking Services**, and then click **Details**.
5. The **Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS)** check box indicates if WINS is installed.
6. Click cancel several times to exit **Add/Remove Windows Components**.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. The vulnerability, if exploited, could allow an attacker to cause WINS on Windows Server 2003 to stop responding to all requests.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who could deliver a specially-crafted message to WINS on an affected server could attempt to exploit this vulnerability. Any user who could establish a connection with an affected system by using the affected ports could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

An attacker could attempt to exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially-crafted network message and by sending the message to the affected system. On Windows Server 2003, receipt of such a message could cause the service to fail causing a denial of service.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Only Windows systems that have been configured as WINS servers are vulnerable. Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP cannot be configured as WINS servers. Therefore, these operating systems are not affected by this vulnerability.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could attempt to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet. Microsoft has provided information about how you can help protect your PC. IT Professionals can visit the [Security Center Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21171).

**What does the update do?**

The update eliminates the vulnerability by changing the method that WINS uses to validate the name value before it passes the value to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**How does this vulnerability relate to the WINS Vulnerability that is corrected by MS04-006?**

Both vulnerabilities were in WINS. However, this update addresses a new vulnerability that was not addressed as part of MS04-006. MS04-006 helps protect against the vulnerability that is discussed in that bulletin, but does not address this new vulnerability. This update replaces MS04-006. You may install this update to help protect your system against both vulnerabilities.

#### Association Context Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1080:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in WINS because of the way that it handles association context validation. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious network packet that could potentially allow remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, attempts to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in a denial of service on Windows Server 2003. The service would have to be restarted to restore functionality.

#### Mitigating Factors for Association Context Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1080:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

# How to help protect against a WINS security issue

## INTRODUCTION

We are investigating reports of a security issue with Microsoft Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). This security issue affects Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, and Microsoft Windows Server 2003. This security issue does not affect Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional, Microsoft Windows XP, or Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition.

## More Information

By default, WINS is not installed on Windows NT Server 4.0, Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, Windows 2000 Server, or Windows Server 2003. By default, WINS is installed and running on Microsoft Small Business Server 2000 and Microsoft Windows Small Business Server 2003. By default, on all versions of Microsoft Small Business Server, the WINS component communication ports are blocked from the Internet, and WINS is available only on the local network.

This security issue could make it possible for an attacker to remotely compromise a WINS server if one of the following conditions is true:

* You have changed the default configuration to install the WINS server role on Windows NT Server 4.0, Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, Windows 2000 Server, or Windows Server 2003.
* You are running Microsoft Small Business Server 2000 or Microsoft Windows Small Business Server 2003, and an attacker has access to your local network.

To help protect your computer against this potential vulnerability, follow these steps:

1. Block TCP port 42 and UDP port 42 at the firewall.

   These ports are used to initiate a connection with a remote WINS server. If you block these ports at the firewall, you help prevent computers that are behind that firewall from trying to use this vulnerability. TCP port 42 and UDP port 42 are the default WINS replication ports. We recommend blocking all incoming unsolicited communication from the Internet.
2. Use Internet Protocol security (IPsec) to help protect traffic between WINS server replication partners. To do this, use one of the following options.

   Caution Because each WINS infrastructure is unique, these changes may have unexpected effects on your infrastructure. We strongly recommend that you perform a risk analysis before you choose to implement this mitigation. We also strongly recommend that you perform complete testing before you put this mitigation into production.

   * Option 1: Manually configure the IPSec filters
      Manually configure the IPSec filters, and then follow the instructions in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article to add a block filter that blocks all packets from any IP address to your system's IP address:

     [813878](http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/813878) How to block specific network protocols and ports by using IPSec

     If you use IPSec in your Windows 2000 Active Directory domain environment and you deploy your IPSec policy by using Group Policy, the domain policy overrides any locally defined policy. This occurrence prevents this option from blocking the packets that you want.

     To determine whether your servers are receiving an IPSec policy from a Windows 2000 domain or a later version, see to the “Determine whether an IPSec policy is assigned” section in Knowledge Base article 813878.

     When you have determined that you can create an effective local IPSec policy, download the IPSeccmd.exe tool or the IPSecpol.exe tool.

     The following commands block inbound and outbound access to TCP port 42 and UDP port 42.

     Note In these commands, %**IPSEC\_Command**% refers to Ipsecpol.exe (on Windows 2000) or Ipseccmd.exe (on Windows Server 2003).

     ````
     %IPSEC_Command% -w REG -p "Block WINS Replication" -r "Block All Inbound TCP Port 42 Rule" -f *=0:42:TCP -n BLOCK
     %IPSEC_Command% -w REG -p "Block WINS Replication" -r "Block All Inbound UDP Port 42 Rule" -f *=0:42:UDP -n BLOCK
     %IPSEC_Command% -w REG -p "Block WINS Replication" -r "Block All Outbound TCP Port 42 Rule" -f 0=*:42:TCP -n BLOCK
     %IPSEC_Command% -w REG -p "Block WINS Replication" -r "Block All Outbound UDP Port 42 Rule" -f 0=*:42:UDP -n BLOCK

     ````

     The following command makes the IPSec policy effective immediately if there is no conflicting policy. This command will start blocking all inbound/outbound TCP port 42 and UDP port 42 packets. This effectively prevents WINS replication from occurring between the server that these commands were run on and any WINS replication partners.

     ````
     %IPSEC_Command% -w REG -p "Block WINS Replication" –x
     ````

     If you experience problems on the network after you enable this IPSec policy, you can unassign the policy and then delete the policy by using the following commands:

     ````
     %IPSEC_Command% -w REG -p "Block WINS Replication" -y
     %IPSEC_Command% -w REG -p "Block WINS Replication" -o
     ````

     To allow WINS replication to function between specific WINS replication partners you must override these block rules with allow rules. The allow rules should specify the IP addresses of your trusted WINS replication partners only.

     You can use the following commands to update the Block WINS Replication IPSec policy to allow specific IP addresses to communicate with the server that is using the Block WINS Replication policy.

     Note In these commands, %**IPSEC\_Command**% refers to Ipsecpol.exe (on Windows 2000) or Ipseccmd.exe (on Windows Server 2003), and %**IP**% refers to the IP address of the remote WINS server that you want to replicate with.

     ````
     %IPSEC_Command% -w REG -p "Block WINS Replication" -r "Allow Inbound TCP Port 42 from %IP% Rule" -f %IP%=0:42:TCP -n PASS
     %IPSEC_Command% -w REG -p "Block WINS Replication" -r "Allow Inbound UDP Port 42 from %IP% Rule" -f %IP%=0:42:UDP -n PASS
     %IPSEC_Command% -w REG -p "Block WINS Replication" -r "Allow Outbound TCP Port 42 to %IP% Rule" -f 0=%IP%:42:TCP -n PASS
     %IPSEC_Command% -w REG -p "Block WINS Replication" -r "Allow Outbound UDP Port 42 to %IP% Rule" -f 0=%IP%:42:UDP -n PASS

     ````

     To assign the policy immediately, use the following command:

     ````
     %IPSEC_Command% -w REG -p "Block WINS Replication" -x
     ````
   * Option 2: Run a script to automatically configure the IPSec filters
      Download and then run the WINS Replication Blocker script that creates an IPSec policy to block the ports. To do this, follow these steps:

     1. To download and extract the .exe files, follow these steps:

        1. Download the WINS Replication Blocker script.

            The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

           ![Download](https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/hotfix.windows/neutral/dea9ad89-e39c-09ee-0d36-67beddb48e26/ab0a77c499b1ee6380a7f549308feb48e7a77094.png)[Download the WINS Replication Blocker script package now.](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=20f8df98-7eee-4293-b80a-c34bb1208828&amp;displaylang=en)

            Release Date: December 2, 2004

            For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

           [119591](http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/119591) How to obtain Microsoft support files from online services
            Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was posted. The file is stored on security-enhanced servers that help to prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

           If you are downloading the WINS Replication Blocker script to a floppy disk, use a formatted blank disk. If you are downloading the WINS Replication Blocker script to your hard disk, create a new folder to temporarily save the file to and extract the file from.

           Caution Do not download files directly to your Windows folder. This action could overwrite files that are required for your computer to operate correctly.
        2. Locate the file in the folder that you downloaded it to, and then double-click the self-extracting .exe file to extract the contents to a temporary folder. For example, extract the contents to **C:\Temp**.
     2. Open a command prompt, and then move to the directory where the files are extracted.
     3. Warning

        + If you suspect that your WINS servers may be infected, but you are not sure what WINS servers are compromised or whether your current WINS server is compromised, do not enter any IP addresses in step 3. However, as of November 2004, we are not aware of any customers who have been affected by this issue. Therefore, if your servers are functioning as expected, continue as described.
        + If you incorrectly set up IPsec, you may cause serious WINS replication problems on your corporate network.

        Run the Block\_Wins\_Replication.cmd file. To create the TCP port 42 and UDP port 42 inbound and outbound block rules, type
         1 and then press ENTER to select option 1 when you are prompted to select the option that you want.

        After you select option 1, the script prompts you to enter the IP addresses of the trusted WINS replication servers.

        Each IP address that you enter is exempted from the blocking TCP port 42 and UDP port 42 policy. You are prompted in a loop, and you can enter as many IP addresses as needed. If you do not know all the IP addresses of the WINS replication partners, you can run the script again in the future. To start entering IP addresses of trusted WINS replication partners, type **2** and then press ENTER to select option 2 when you are prompted to select the that option you want.

        After you deploy the security update, you can remove the IPSec policy. To do this, run the script. Type 3 and then press ENTER to select option 3 when you are prompted to select the option that you want.

        For additional information about IPsec and about how to apply filters, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

        [313190](http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/313190) How to use IPsec IP filter lists in Windows 2000
3. Remove WINS if you do not need it.

    If you no longer need WINS, follow these steps to remove it. These steps apply to Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, and later versions of these operating systems. For Windows NT Server 4.0, follow the procedure that is included in the product documentation.

   Important Many organizations require WINS to perform single label or flat name registration and resolution functions on their network. Administrators should not remove WINS unless one of the following conditions is true:

   * The administrator fully understands the effect that removing WINS this will have on their network.
   * The administrator has configured DNS to provide the equivalent functionality by using fully qualified domain names and DNS domain suffixes.

   Also, if an administrator is removing the WINS functionality from a server that will continue to provide shared resources on the network, the administrator must correctly reconfigure the system to use the remaining name resolution services like DNS on the local network.

   For more information about WINS, visit the following Microsoft Web site:
