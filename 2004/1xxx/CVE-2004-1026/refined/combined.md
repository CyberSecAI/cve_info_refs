Debian Security Advisory DSA 628-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
January 6th, 2005                       <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : imlib2
Vulnerability  : integer overflows
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-1026

Pavel Kankovsky discovered that several overflows found in the libXpm
library were also present in imlib and imlib2, imaging libraries for
X11.  An attacker could create a carefully crafted image file in such
a way that it could cause an application linked with imlib or imlib2
to execute arbitrary code when the file was opened by a victim.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CAN-2004-1025

    Multiple heap-based buffer overflows.  No such code is present in
    imlib2.

CAN-2004-1026

    Multiple integer overflows in the imlib library.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.5-2woody2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your imlib2 packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# imlib: Buffer overflows in image decoding — GLSA **200412-03**

Multiple overflows have been found in the imlib library image decoding
routines, potentially allowing execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/imlib** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.9.14-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.9.14-r3** |

### Background

imlib is an advanced replacement library for image manipulation
libraries like libXpm. It is called by numerous programs, including
gkrellm and several window managers, to help in displaying images.

### Description

Pavel Kankovsky discovered that several overflows found in the
libXpm library (see GLSA 200409-34) also applied to imlib. He also
fixed a number of other potential flaws.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a carefully-crafted
image file, which would potentially lead to execution of arbitrary code
with the rights of the user viewing the image. This affects any program
that makes use of the imlib library.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All imlib users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/imlib-1.9.14-r3"
```
