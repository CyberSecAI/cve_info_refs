The provided content describes vulnerabilities in JAF CMS version 3.0 Release Candidate.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `displaycontent()` function in `config.php` attempts to include a file based on the `show` parameter. If the `show` parameter is empty, the `file_exists()` check fails, and the script tries to include the path "data/", which causes a PHP error. This error reveals the full server path to the application.
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient input validation, improper error handling leading to information disclosure.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can learn the full path of the application on the server, which can help in further attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a request to `index.php` with an empty `show` parameter (`index.php?show=`).
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker, no special privileges required.
*   **Path Traversal:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `displaycontent()` function doesn't sanitize the `show` parameter, allowing an attacker to use `../` sequences to access files outside the intended directories.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input sanitization and validation, allowing path traversal.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files and source code.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a request to `index.php` with a `show` parameter containing path traversal sequences, e.g., `index.php?show=../../../../../../../etc/passwd`.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker, no special privileges required.

The vendor was contacted and has fixed the vulnerabilities.
