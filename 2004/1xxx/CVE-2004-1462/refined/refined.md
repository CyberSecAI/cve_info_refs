- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Two unspecified bugs exist in MoinMoin. One allows anonymous users elevated access even when ACLs are not in use. The other bug lies within the ACL handling of the PageEditor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper enforcement of access restrictions for anonymous users, and flawed ACL handling.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized users could gain administrative access to functions such as "revert" and "delete". Sites are vulnerable whether or not they are using ACLs.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote access via the MoinMoin application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special capabilities are specified other than the ability to access the MoinMoin application. The user can be anonymous.
