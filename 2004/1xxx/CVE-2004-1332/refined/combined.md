## HP-UX FTP daemon is vulnerable to a buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#647438

Original Release Date: 2005-02-25 | Last Revised: 2005-02-25

---

### Overview

The HP-UX FTP daemon (ftpd) contains a buffer overflow that may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| The HP-UX FTP daemon (ftpd) is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when the FTP daemon is configured to log debugging information. Debug logging is enabled if the -v flag is present next to the ftpd entry in the inetd.conf (/etc/inetd.conf) configuration file. If an unauthenticated remote attacker supplies the FTP daemon with a specially crafted command, they may be able to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow.  Please note that the debug logging option is disabled by default. |
| --- |

### Impact

| If an unauthenticated, remote attacker supplies the FTP daemon with a specially crafted command, that attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the FTP daemon, typically root. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**  HP has released the following patches to correct this issue:HP-UX B.11.00: PHNE\_29460HP-UX B.11.04: PHNE\_31034HP-UX B.11.11: PHNE\_29461HP-UX B.11.22: PHNE\_29462HP customers are encouraged to go to the [lT Resource Center](http://itrc.hp.com) to download these patches. |
| --- |

| **Disable Debug Logging**  The debug logging option is disabled by default. However, if it is enabled, disable it by removing the -v option from the ftpd command within the service inetd.conf configuration file. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
