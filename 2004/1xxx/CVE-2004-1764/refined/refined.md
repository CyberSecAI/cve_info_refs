- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow exists in the `libDtSvc` library, which is part of the Common Desktop Environment (CDE) in HP-UX.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows a local user to potentially gain root-level access.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring an attacker to have local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be a local user on the affected HP-UX system.
