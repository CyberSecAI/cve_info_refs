    Bulletins from the HP IT Resource Center via electronic
    mail, do the following:

    Use your browser to get to the HP IT Resource Center page
    at:

       <http://itrc.hp.com>

    Use the 'Login' tab at the left side of the screen to login
    using your ID and password.  Use your existing login or the
    "Register" button at the left to create a login, in order to
    gain access to many areas of the ITRC.  Remember to save the
    User ID assigned to you, and your password.

    In the left most frame select "Maintenance and Support".

    Under the "Notifications" section (near the bottom of
    the page), select "Support Information Digests".

    To -subscribe- to future HP Security Bulletins or other
    Technical Digests, click the check box (in the left column)
    for the appropriate digest and then click the "Update
    Subscriptions" button at the bottom of the page.

    To -gain access- to the Security Patch Matrix, select
    the link for "The Security Bulletins Archive".  (near the

    and by bulletin topic.  Security Patch Check completely
    automates the process of reviewing the patch matrix for
    11.XX systems.  Please note that installing the patches
    listed in the Security Patch Matrix will completely
    implement a security bulletin \_only\_ if the MANUAL ACTIONS
    field specifies "No."

    The Security Patch Check tool can verify that a security
    bulletin has been implemented on HP-UX 11.XX systems providing
    that the fix is completely implemented in a patch with no
    manual actions required.  The Security Patch Check tool cannot
    verify fixes implemented via a product upgrade.

    For information on the Security Patch Check tool, see:
