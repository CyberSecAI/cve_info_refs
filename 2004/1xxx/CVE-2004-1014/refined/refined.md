{
  "cve": "CVE-2004-1014",
  "affected_components": [
    "nfs-utils"
  ],
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The rpc.statd daemon in nfs-utils did not properly handle the SIGPIPE signal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper signal handling"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service by prematurely terminating a TCP connection to the rpc.statd service, leading to the termination of the server process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network connection"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a TCP connection with the vulnerable service and then abruptly terminate it."
  },
    "summary": "The rpc.statd daemon in nfs-utils was vulnerable to a denial of service attack because it did not ignore the SIGPIPE signal. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by prematurely terminating a TCP connection to the service, causing the server process to terminate."
