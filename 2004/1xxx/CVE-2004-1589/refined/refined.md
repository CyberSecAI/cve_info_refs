The provided content relates to CVE-2004-1589.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The GoSmart Message Board application is vulnerable to SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to insufficient input validation and sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in various parameters within the `Forum.asp` and `Login_Exec.asp` scripts, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.
    *   Vulnerable parameters include: `QuestionNumber`, `Category`, `Username`, and `Password`.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not properly sanitize user input in the `Category` parameter within the `Forum.asp` script and in the `MainMessageID` parameter within the `ReplyToQuestion.asp` script allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that are executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying database, potentially allowing access to sensitive data, modification of data, or even complete control of the database. The advisory notes that the risk is minimal due to the use of an Access database.
*  **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious client-side scripts. This could allow attackers to steal cookies (including authentication cookies), redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   HTTP GET requests to `Forum.asp` by manipulating the `QuestionNumber` and `Category` parameters.
    *   HTTP POST requests to `Login_Exec.asp` by manipulating the `Username` and `Password` parameters.
*   **XSS:**
    *   HTTP GET requests to `Forum.asp` by manipulating the `Category` parameter.
    *  HTTP GET requests to `ReplyToQuestion.asp` by manipulating the `MainMessageID` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
