## WinAmp contains a flaw in metadata handling in .mpa and .mp4 files

#### Vulnerability Note VU#372968

Original Release Date: 2005-02-21 | Last Revised: 2005-02-21

---

### Overview

WinAmp contains a flaw which may allow an attacker to crash WinAmp remotely via .mpa or .mp4 files.

### Description

| Nullsoft's WinAmp Player, a popular multimedia system for Microsoft Windows, contains a flaw in the handling of the metadata (called "tags") contained within .mpa and .mp4 files. Invalid data within these files could crash WinAmp.  WinAmp is susceptible to a remote Denial of Service flaw if maliciously crafted .mp4 or .mpa files are loaded. This flaw could cause WinAmp to unexpectedly crash. Also, the flaw may be exploited in combination with the default setting for some web browsers to automatically open WinAmp playlist (.pls, .m3u) files without prompting. A malicious playlist, with pointers to remote files on the Internet, may be embedded in a web page specifically crafted to automatically load the playlist. As such, a user may unintentionally load a flawed mpa or .mp4 file by following an innocuous web link. |
| --- |

### Impact

| WinAmp may crash, resulting in a denial of service to the user running it. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This flaw has been corrected in WinAmp version 5.08c and later. Download and install the latest version from:<<http://www.winamp.com/player/>> |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**Do not open .mpa, .mp4, .pls or .m3u files automatically with WinAmp in your web browser.Do not open unknown .mpa, .mp4, .pls or .m3u files.Of course, these recommendations always apply to any unknown files and file types. It is also always advised for all users to ensure their browser will prompt for the desired action (Save, Cancel, Open) with all filetypes that may load remote data, such as WinAmp .pls or .m3u playlist file types. |

Winamp 5.07 (latest version) Remote Crash.
+ vuln to cause 100% cpu usage.

13/12/04

I. BACKGROUND

Winamp is a very popular windows audio
and video player. It also has alot
of other features and is used by
millions of people across the world.

II. DESCRIPTION

VULN 1.

There is a vuln in winamp's handling of .mp4
and .m4a files. Which when exploited can
remotly crash the victims winamp.

The vuln lies in the .mp4 tagging system
which winamp uses.If you use winamps built
in feature to edit the tags on .mp4 or .m4a
files and insert any data in there the next
time the file is opened it will instantly
crash winamp.

now how to crash it remotly.

if we create a .pls file contaning the data

[playlist]
numberofentries=5
File1=<http://b0f.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/a.mp4>
Title1=
Length5=-1
Version=2

and make a html page containing an iframe linking
to the .pls like.

<html>
<iframe
src="<http://b0f.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/exp2.pls>">

now if the victim clicks a link to a page like

<http://b0f.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/wexp3.htm>

it will auto open up the .pls file and load the .mp4
file into winamp and crash it.

This could also be done with .m3u instead of .pls

VULN 2.

This one is simple if you create say a 1mb file
probably smaller filled with junk and name it
with either .nsv or .nsa file extension.
When opened in winamp it will cause 100% cpu
usage. The bigger the size of the file the
more it will probably slow down the system.

III. ANALYSIS

Vuln 1.
Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to
crash the victims winamp.

Vuln 2.
Successful exploitation causes 100% cpu usage.

IV. DETECTION

This has been confirmed in the latest version of
winamp
5.07 and probably vuln in earlier versions.

V. WORKAROUND

Don't open suspicous .mp4 .m4a .nsa or .nsv files or
click untrusted links.

VI. VENDOR

The vendor has not been contacted.
Why bother ? one asks
