## Adobe Acrobat Reader for UNIX contains a buffer overflow in mailListIsPdf()

#### Vulnerability Note VU#253024

Original Release Date: 2005-01-20 | Last Revised: 2005-03-09

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow in Adobe Acrobat Reader for UNIX could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| [Adobe Acrobat Reader](http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html) is an application that allows users to view PDF (Portable Document Format) files. Acrobat Reader for UNIX (Linux, Sun Solaris SPARC, IBM AIX, or HP-UX) contains a buffer overflow in the mailListIsPdf() function. This function determines if the specified input file is an email message containing a PDF attachment. When parsing the email message, this function unsafely copies user-supplied data to a fixed size buffer. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker could execute arbitrary code with privileges of the local user. Remote exploitation could be possible by attaching a specially crafted PDF to an email message. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade Acrobat Reader**  This issue is resolved in [Acrobat Reader 5.0.10 for UNIX](http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html). |
| --- |

| **Patch acroread shell script**The [iDEFENSE Security Advisory 12.14.04](http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=161&type=vulnerabilities) contains an unofficial patch for the acroread shell script. According to the advisory, this patch verifies that the files passed to the Acrobat Reader application are PDF documents. |
