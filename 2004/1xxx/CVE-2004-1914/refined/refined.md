The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in NukeCalendar v1.1.a, including full path disclosure, cross-site scripting (XSS), and SQL injection.

**1. Full Path Disclosure:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application displays full server paths in error messages when invalid input is provided to the `eid` parameter in the `modules.php` script. Additionally, direct access to block files reveals error messages with full paths.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Insufficient error handling and lack of input validation for the `eid` parameter and unprotected access to block files.
*   **Impact:**  Attackers can learn the server's file system structure, which can be useful for further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `modules.php` script with an invalid `eid` value or directly accessing block files via HTTP.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No special capabilities needed, the attacker just needs to send HTTP requests.

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `eid` parameter before displaying it.
*  **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization for the `eid` parameter in `modules.php`.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's pages. This code can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other harmful actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET or POST request to the `modules.php` script with a malicious JavaScript code in the `eid` parameter. POST request is preferred because of the restrictive filter against GET requests in `mainfile.php`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No special capabilities needed, the attacker just needs to send HTTP requests.

**3. SQL Injection:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `eid` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization for the `eid` parameter in `modules.php`, allowing SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This can be used to steal data, modify data, or even gain full control of the database server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `modules.php` script with a malicious SQL query in the `eid` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No special capabilities needed, the attacker just needs to send HTTP requests. The attacker can retrieve sensitive data, such as usernames and password hashes.
