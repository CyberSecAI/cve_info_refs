The provided content describes a vulnerability in MailPost version 5.1.1sv and possibly earlier versions. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to verify the existence of files anywhere on the local system.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a malformed HTTP GET query string that, when sent to the MailPost script, allows an attacker to probe the existence of files on the server's filesystem.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is an information disclosure issue. The software reveals information about the server's file system that should not be exposed to remote users.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can determine the presence or absence of specific files on the server. This information could be used to gather sensitive details about the server's environment, potentially leading to further attacks.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a remote attacker sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the MailPost script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target MailPost server.
