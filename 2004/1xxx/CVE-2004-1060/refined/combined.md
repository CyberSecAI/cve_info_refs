How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves several newly-discovered, privately-reported and public vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own âVulnerability Detailsâ section.

An attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. However, an attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities would most likely cause the affected system to stop responding.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Windows 98, 98 SE, ME | Windows 2000 | Windows XP Service Pack 1 | Windows XP Service Pack 2 | Windows Server 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IP Validation Vulnerability - [CAN-2005-0048](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2005-0048) | Remote Code Execution | Not Critical | Critical | Critical | None | None |
| ICMP Connection Reset Vulnerability - [CAN-2004-0790](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2004-0790) | Denial of Service | Not Critical | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |
| ICMP Path MTU Vulnerability - [CAN-2004-1060](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2004-1060) | Denial of Service | Not Critical | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |
| TCP Connection Reset Vulnerability - [CAN-2004-0230](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2004-0230) | Denial of Service\ | Not Critical | Low | Low | None | Low |
| Spoofed Connection Request Vulnerability - [CAN-2005-0688](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2005-0688) | Denial of Service\ | None | None | None | Low | Low |
| **Aggregate Severity of All Vulnerabilities** | **Not Critical** | **Critical** | **Critical** | **Moderate** | **Moderate** |  |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Note** The severity ratings for non x86 operating system versions map to the x86 operating systems versions as follows:

* The Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1 (Itanium) severity rating is the same as Windows XP Service Pack 1 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium) severity rating is the same as Windows XP Service Pack 1 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems severity rating is the same as Windows Server 2003 severity rating.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Why did Microsoft update this bulletin on June 14, 2005**

Microsoft updated this bulletin today to advise customers that a revised version of the security update is available. The original security update successfully addressed the vulnerabilities described in this security bulletin. However, there is a known network connectivity issue that affects a particular type of network configuration when using the original security update. For more information on this issue see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 898060](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/898060/). [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 893066](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/893066) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this revised security update.

We are distributing this re-release broadly to customers to help reduce the likelihood that customers will encounter this network connectivity issue in the future. We recommend installing this revised security update even if you have installed the previous version. The revised security update will be available through Windows Update, Software Update Services (SUS), and will be recommended by the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA), except on certain systems as documented in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 901159](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/901159/). Customers that have installed the hotfix that was available to address this network connectivity issue should also install the revised security update.

#### ICMP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0790:

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists that could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) message to an affected system. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to reset existing TCP connections.

#### Mitigating Factors for ICMP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0790:

* Firewall best practices and firewall or router configurations that block all ICMP traffic can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* For an attacker to try to exploit this vulnerability, they must first predict or learn the IP address and port information of the source and of the destination of an existing TCP network connection.
* This attack would have to be performed on each TCP connection that was targeted for reset. Many applications will automatically restore connections that have been reset.

#### Workarounds for ICMP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0790:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Block all ICMP network packets at the firewall or at the router:**

  ICMP network packets are used to initiate a connection with the affected components. Blocking them at the firewall or at the router will help protect systems that are behind that firewall or router from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet. ISA Server 2000 and ISA Server 2004 can be used to block the affected types of traffic.

  **Impact of Workaround:** This workaround can also negatively impact performance by preventing TCP from optimizing network communication. ICMP network packets can eliminate fragmentation at routers connecting networks with different MTUs. Fragmentation reduces TCP throughput and increases network congestion.
* **Block ICMP traffic by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to reset existing TCP connections. Those connections would have to be re-established for normal communication to continue. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or elevate their user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The affected messages are not being ignored in certain cases that allow an attacker to send a malformed packet which may cause the reset of an existing connection.

**What is TCP/IP?**

TCP/IP is a set of networking protocols that are widely used on the Internet. TCP/IP provides communications across interconnected networks of computers that have diverse hardware architectures and that run various operating systems. TCP/IP includes standards for how computers communicate and conventions for connecting networks and for routing traffic. For more information about TCP/IP, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40954).

**What is ICMP?**

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a required TCP/IP standard that is defined in RFC 792, "Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)." Hosts and routers that use IP communication can report errors and exchange limited control and status information using ICMP.

ICMP messages are usually sent automatically in one of the following situations:

* An IP datagram cannot reach its destination.
* An IP router (gateway) cannot forward datagrams at the current rate of transmission.
* An IP router redirects the sending host to a better route to the destination.

You can use the **ping** command to send ICMP echo request messages and to record the receipt of ICMP echo reply messages. By using these messages, you can detect network or host communication failures and troubleshoot common TCP/IP connectivity problems. For more information about ICMP, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40955).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to reset TCP connections.

#### ICMP Path MTU Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1060:

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists that could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) message to an affected system that could cause network performance to degrade and potentially stop the affected system from responding to requests.

#### Mitigating Factors for ICMP Path MTU Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1060:

* Firewall best practices and firewall or router configurations that block all ICMP traffic can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* For an attacker to try to exploit this vulnerability, they must first predict or learn the IP address information of the source and of the destination of an existing TCP network connection.

#### Workarounds for ICMP Path MTU Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1060:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Disable Path MTU Discovery.**

  Disabling Path MTU Discovery will prevent an attacker from specifying a low MTU value that could degrade network performance by following these steps:

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  **Note** We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regedt32**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. In Registry Editor, locate the following registry key: **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters**
  3. Add the DWORD Value: **EnablePMTUDiscovery**. Set the value to **0**. This value disables Path MTU Discovery. By default, this key does not exist.
  4. You must restart your system for this change to take effect.

  **Impact of Workaround:** These changes will help prevent attacks restricting the ability of an attacker to reduce the Path MTU value to a low value. This setting can also negatively impact performance by preventing TCP from optimizing network communication. This optimization can eliminate fragmentation at routers connecting networks with different MTUs. Fragmentation reduces TCP throughput and increases network congestion. For more information about **EnablePMTUDiscovery**, see the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/regentry/58752.mspx).
* **Block all ICMP network packets at the firewall or at the router:**

  ICMP network packets are used to initiate a connection with the affected components. Blocking them at the firewall or at the router will help protect systems that are behind that firewall or router from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet. ISA Server 2000 and ISA Server 2004 can be used to block the affected types of traffic.

For more information about ICMP, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40955).

**What is Path MTU Discovery?**

Path maximum transmission unit (PMTU) discovery is the process of discovering the maximum size of packet that can be sent across the network between two hosts without fragmentation (that is, without the packet being broken into multiple frames during transmission). It is described in RFC 1191. For more information, see [RFC 1191](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1191.txt?number=1191). For additional information, see the following [MSDN Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms817967.aspx).

**What is wrong with the Path MTU Discovery process?**

Path maximum transmission unit (PMTU) discovery allows an attacker to specify a value that can degrade network performance for other connections. On unsecured networks, allowing PMTU discovery carries the risk that an attacker might force the MTU to a very small value and overwork the local system's TCP/IP stack. Normally this behavior would be restricted to the single connection that an attacker could establish. However, this vulnerability allows an attacker to modify the MTU value on other connections beyond their own connection to the affected system.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to degrade network performance.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted message and sending the message to an affected system. The message could then cause the affected system to degrade network performance.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All affected operating systems are at risk from this vulnerability. However, servers are at primary risk from this vulnerability because they maintain connections with clients that could be vulnerable to performance degradation.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. By default, the Microsoft Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) allows these kinds of malicious network packets and cannot be used to filter them.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by restricting the minimum value of the MTU to 576 bytes. This update also modifies the way that the affected operating systems validate ICMP requests.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CAN-2004-1060.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

#### FAQ for Spoofed Connection Request Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0688:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding for a limited time. During that time, affected systems cannot respond to requests. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected system to stop accepting requests.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The affected operating systems perform incomplete validation of TCP/IP network packets. This vulnerability occurs when a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) SYN packet is received with a spoofed source Internet Protocol (IP) address and port number that is identical to that of the destination IP address and port. The effect of this makes it appear that the host computer has sent a packet to itself. If this attack is successful, a loop is created and extra computer CPU time is used.

**What is TCP/IP?**

TCP/IP is a set of networking protocols that are widely used on the Internet. TCP/IP provides communications across interconnected networks of computers that have diverse hardware architectures and that run various operating systems. TCP/IP includes standards for how computers communicate and conventions for connecting networks and for routing traffic. For more information about TCP/IP, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40954).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted message and sending the message to an affected system. The message could then cause the affected system to stop responding.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. Prior operating system versions are not vulnerable to this issue.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. However, this attack requires that routers forward malformed TCP/IP network packets. Most routers will not forward these kinds of malformed TCP/IP network packets.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the affected operating systems validate TCP/IP requests.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CAN-2005-0688. It also has been named âLand Attackâ by the larger security community.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had seen examples of proof of concept code published publicly but had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Does applying this security update help protect customers from the code that has been published publicly that attempts to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. This security update addresses the vulnerability that is demonstrated by the existing proof of concept code that has been published.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB893066\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain updated information for the revised version of this security update if the original version was installed. See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 901168](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/901168) for more information.

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 893066 security update into the Windows installation source files.

SSRT4743, SSRT4884 rev.1 - HP Tru64 UNIX TCP/IP remote Denial of
                           Service (DoS)

NOTICE:
The information in this Security Bulletin should be acted upon
as soon as possible.

INITIAL RELEASE:
04 October 2005

POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:
Remote Denial of Service (DoS)

SOURCE:
Hewlett-Packard Company
HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:
Several potential security vulnerabilities have been identified
in the HP Tru64 UNIX TCP/IP including ICMP, and Initial Sequence
Number generation (ISNs). These exploits could result in a remote
Denial of Service (DoS) from network throughput reduction for
TCP connections, the reset of TCP connections, or TCP spoofing.

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP Tru64 UNIX 5.1B-3
HP Tru64 UNIX 5.1B-2/PK4

HP Tru64 UNIX 4.0F PK8

BACKGROUND:

Special Instructions for the Customer

The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) (RFC 792) is used in
the Internet Architecture to perform fault-isolation and recovery
(RFC816), which is the group of actions that hosts and routers
take to determine if a network failure has occurred.

The industry standard TCP specification (RFC 793) has a
vulnerability whereby ICMP packets can be used to perform a
variety of attacks such as blind connection reset attacks and
blind throughput-reduction attacks. Blind connection reset
attacks can be triggered by an attacker sending forged ICMP
"Destination Unreachable, host unreachable" packets or ICMP
"Destination Unreachable, port unreachable" packets.  Blind
throughput-reduction attacks can be caused by an attacker sending
a forged ICMP type 4 (Source Quench) packet.

Path MTU Discovery (RFC 1191) describes a technique for
dynamically discovering the MTU (maximum transmission unit) of an
arbitrary internet path.  This protocol uses ICMP packets from
the router to discover the MTU for a TCP connection path.  An
attacker can reduce the throughput of a TCP connection by sending
forged ICMP packets (or their IPv6 counterpart) to the
discovering host, causing an incorrect Path MTU setting.

HP has addressed these potential vulnerabilities by providing a
new kernel tunable in Tru64 UNIX V5.1B and 5.1A,
icmp_tcpseqcheck. In Tru64 4.0F and 4.0G, HP has introduced two
new kernel tunables, icmp_tcpseqcheck and icmp_rejectcodemask.
The icmp_rejectcodemask tunable is already available in Tru64
UNIX V5.1B and 5.1A.

icmp_tcpseqcheck

The icmp_tcpseqcheck variable mitigates ICMP attacks against TCP
by checking that the TCP sequence number contained in the payload
of the ICMP error message is within the range of the data already
sent but not yet acknowledged. An ICMP error message that does
not pass this check is discarded. This behavior protects TCP
against spoofed ICMP packets.

Set the tunable as follows:

  icmp_tcpseqcheck=1 (default)

    Provides a level of protection that reduces the possibility
    of considering a spoofed ICMP packet as valid
    to one in two raised to the thirty-second power.

  icmp_tcpseqcheck=0

    Retains existing behavior, i.e., accepts all ICMP packets

icmp_rejectcodemask

In the Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers (RFC 1812), research
suggests that the use of ICMP Source Quench packets is an
ineffective (and unfair) antidote for congestion. Thus, HP
recommends completely ignoring ICMP Source Quench packets using
the icmp_rejectcodemask tunable. The icmp_rejectcodemask is a
bitmask that designates the ICMP codes that the system should
reject. For example, to reject ICMP Source Quench packets,
set the mask bit position for the ICMP_SOURCEQUENCH code 4,
which is two to the 4th power = 16 (0x10 hex).
The icmp_rejectcodemask tunable can be used to reject any
ICMP packet type, or multiple masks can be combined to reject
more than one type.

Note: The ICMP type codes are defined in
      "/usr/include/netinet/ip_icmp.h".

  Set the tunable as follows:

    icmp_rejectcodemask = 0x10

      Rejects ICMP Source Quench packets

    icmp_rejectcodemask = 0 (default)

      Retains existing behavior, i.e., accepts all ICMP packets

Adjusting the variables

The ICMP sequence check variable (icmp_tcpseqcheck) can be
adjusted using the sysconfig and sysconfigdb commands:

# sysconfig -q inet icmp_tcpseqcheck
inet:
icmp_tcpseqcheck = 1
# sysconfig -r inet icmp_tcpseqcheck=0
icmp_tcpseqcheck: reconfigured
# sysconfig -q inet icmp_tcpseqcheck
inet:
icmp_tcpseqcheck = 0
# sysconfig -q inet icmp_tcpseqcheck > /tmp/icmp_tcpseqcheck_merge
# sysconfigdb -m -f /tmp/icmp_tcpseqcheck_merge inet
# sysconfigdb -l inet

inet:
      icmp_tcpseqcheck = 1

Similarly, the icmp_rejectcodemask variable can be adjusted using
the sysconfig and sysconfigdb commands:

# sysconfig -q inet icmp_rejectcodemask
inet:
icmp_rejectcodemask = 0
# sysconfig -r inet icmp_rejectcodemask=0x10
icmp_rejectcodemask: reconfigured
# sysconfig -q inet icmp_rejectcodemask
inet:
icmp_rejectcodemask = 16
# sysconfig -q inet icmp_rejectcodemask
      > /tmp/icmp_rejectcodemask_merge
# sysconfigdb -m -f /tmp/icmp_rejectcodemask_merge inet
# sysconfigdb -l inet

inet:
        icmp_rejectcodemask = 16
RESOLUTION:

Until the corrections are available in a mainstream
release patch kit, HP is releasing the following Early Release
Patch (ERP) kits publicly for use by any customer.

The ERP kits use dupatch to install and will not install over
any installed Customer Specific Patches (CSPs) that have file
intersections with the ERPs. Contact your service provider for
assistance if the ERP installation is blocked by any of your
installed CSPs.

The fixes contained in the ERP kits are scheduled to be
available in the following mainstream patch kits:
