How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Vendor  : All Enthusiast, Inc.
URL     : <http://www.photopost.com>
Version : PhotoPost PHP Pro 4.6.x && Earlier
Risk    : Multiple Vulnerabilities

Description:
PhotoPost was designed to help you give your users exactly what they
want. Your users will be thrilled to finally be able to upload and
display their photos for your entire community to view and discuss,
all with no more effort than it takes to post a text message to a
forum. If you already have a forum (vBulletin, UBB Threads, phpBB,
DCForum, or InvisionBoard), you'll appreciate that PhotoPost was
designed to seamlessly integrate into your site without the need for
your users to register twice and maintain two logins.

SQL Injection Vulnerability:
There are a large number of possibilities for SQL Injection in Photo
Post. The most important thing to remember here is that this app ties
directly into the affected website's forum system. So the aim of any
smart attacker would be to try and use the vulnerabilities in this app
to gain control of a forum by grabbing member password hashes. Below
are example url's.

addfav.php?photo=[SQL]
comments.php?photo=[SQL]
comments.php?photo=1&cedit=[SQL]
index.php?cat=[SQL]
showgallery.php?ppuser=[SQL]
showgallery.php?cat=[SQL]
uploadphoto.php?cat=[SQL]
useralbums.php?ppaction=delalbum&albumid=[SQL]
useralbums.php?ppaction=editalbum&albumid=[SQL]

I have not released any POC exploit for these issues, because like I said
before the real danger in these holes is the fact they can be used to act
against an installed forum system or other info in the database, and this
varies GREATLY on each Photo Post installation depending on what forum is
installed, and the table prefix's etc etc. A google search returned over
a half of a million websites running Photo Post, so you can imagine the
number of possibilities of the environment varying.

Script Injection:
A malicious user can inject script and html into several fields in Photo
Post. The dangers of this is it allows an attacker to run arbitrary code
in the context of the browser on any user that visits their album. Also,
it can be used to run admin commands and the like by injecting script or
html into a photo description that is awaiting approval by an admin. When
the admin views the photo to be approved the code is then executed. Some
examples of where this can take place is in photo names, photo descriptions,
album names, and album descriptions

Cross Site Scripting:
There are a number of Cross Site Scripting issues present in Photo Post.
And as previously mentioned the danger of it being used against the forum
which it resides are also a very real threat. Below are a list of the XSS
issues in showmembers.php, but it is also worth noting that any of the SQL
Injection vulns previously mentioned can also be used for XSS if Injection
cannot be successfully used.

showmembers.php?cat=1&si=&page=7&sort=7&perpage=12&ppuser=10[XSS]
showmembers.php?cat=1&si=&page=7&sort=7&perpage=12&password=[XSS]
showmembers.php?cat=1&si=&page=7&sort=7&perpage=12&stype=1[XSS]
showmembers.php?cat=1&si=&page=7&sort=7&perpage=1[XSS]
showmembers.php?cat=1&si=&page=7&sort=1[XSS]
showmembers.php?cat=1&si=&page=1[XSS]
showmembers.php?cat=1&si=1[XSS]
showmembers.php?cat=1[XSS]

Any of these XSS issues can be used to possibly steal cookies from the forum
which Photo Post resides, run code in a users browser and more.

Denial of Service:
PhotoPost is prone to a denial of service attack that can allow an attacker
to send a user (logged in or not) a malicious link that will result in the
user not being able to gain normal access to the PhotoPost installation until
they clear their cookies.

showmembers.php?perpage=">&lt;script&gt;var%20i=1;%20while(i){alert(i);};&lt;/script&gt;

This is possible because the "perpage" variable resides in the users cookie.
Like I said before a user does not have to be logged in for this to happen.

Solution:
The vendor was contacted. Most of these issues do not seem to be present in
4.7 though. Original advisory @ <http://www.gulftech.org/03282004.php>

Notice:
These vulnerabilities are different than the one posted by goodb0y of Zone-H as
seen here.

[http://www.zone-h.org/en/advisories/read/id=3844/](http://www.zone-h.org/en/advisories/read/id%3D3844/)
<http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/352372>

It is important for the users of this program to know that in order to be safe.
