The provided content contains detailed information about multiple vulnerabilities in PhotoPost PHP Pro version 4.6.x and earlier.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root cause:**  Insecure handling of user-supplied input in various PHP scripts, allowing for SQL injection.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization and proper parameterization in database queries.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Maliciously crafted URLs with SQL code in parameters like `photo`, `cat`, `ppuser`, and `albumid`.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers can potentially gain control of the forum by extracting password hashes and other sensitive information, as PhotoPost is integrated with forum systems. The attacker can also modify data in the database.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to craft malicious URL requests.
*   **Script Injection:**
    *   **Root cause:** Lack of proper sanitization of user-provided content in fields like photo names, descriptions, and album names.
    *  **Weaknesses:** Inadequate output encoding, allowing the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Submitting malicious script/html code within user input fields.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser of any user that visits the attacker's album. It can also be used to perform administrative actions if injected into content awaiting admin approval.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to create an album and submit user input.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root cause:** Lack of proper sanitization of user input in `showmembers.php`.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient output encoding, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Crafting malicious URL queries with XSS code in parameters like `ppuser`, `password`, `stype`, `perpage`, `sort` etc.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can steal cookies from the forum where PhotoPost resides, execute code in a user's browser, and perform other malicious activities. SQL injection vulnerabilities could also be used for XSS.
     *  **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to craft malicious URL requests.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Root cause:** The `perpage` variable from the URL query is stored in a user's cookie without validation.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation, allowing the injection of malicious code into the cookie through the `perpage` parameter.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Attacker provides a malicious URL with JavaScript code in the `perpage` variable.
    *   **Impact:** The user's browser gets stuck in an infinite loop, which makes the PhotoPost installation inaccessible until the user clears their cookies. This vulnerability affects users even when they are not logged in.
     *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to craft malicious URL requests.

**Additional details:**

*   The advisory highlights the severity of these vulnerabilities due to PhotoPost's integration with forum systems.
*   It mentions that the vulnerabilities may vary greatly based on the forum system in use and the table prefixes of the database.
*   The advisory does not release any Proof of Concept (POC) exploits due to the variability in environments.
*   It points out that a google search returned over half a million websites running PhotoPost.
*   The advisory also notes that these vulnerabilities are different from the one previously posted by goodb0y of Zone-H.
*   The vendor has been contacted, and the issues are mostly fixed in version 4.7.
