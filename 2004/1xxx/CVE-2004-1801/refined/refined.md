```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The PWebServer 0.3.3 does not properly validate user-supplied file paths, allowing directory traversal.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Directory traversal vulnerability. The software fails to check for ".." sequences in the requested filename.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files, passwords, or source code.
- Attack vectors: By sending an HTTP GET request with a crafted URL containing "../" sequences.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server and the ability to send HTTP requests.
