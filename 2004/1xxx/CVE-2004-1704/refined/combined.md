Ok so here is what I found

Authors website wireplastik.com (currently down)
php script I found exploit in wpquiz  version 2.60b8 ( also tested on 2.60b 1-7)

Exploit: by default wpquiz comes with a folder called extras. This folder is not \
password protected nor does it require any sort of authentication to gain entry.

The extras folder contains php version testing scripts, sql testing scripts, and most \
importantly adminrestore.php

So here is how the exploit works.

Do a search on Google for wpquiz (you will find over 500 results)

Test to see if the site has the extras folder
example <http://site-to-exploit.com/wpquiz/extras/adminrestore.php>

If this page comes up the site is vulnerable

Now you must register an account on the site by simply registering
login once then log out
then go to <http://sitetoexploit.com/wpquiz/extras/adminrestore.php>

You can scroll down until you find your username and select it, then hit the button \
Restore Admin Status You are now an ADMIN of the wpquiz php script

you can now login and access the admin control panel; you will have complete control \
over the quiz at this point. You can also edit users accounts; change users email \
addresses then request a lost password. You then have that users password that could \
possibly lead to more problems such as logging into users email that was used to \
register with wpquiz and gain further access

Fix- delete the extras directory, password protect the extras directory or rename the \
extras folder

Please give me full credits for this exploit find. I have tried to contact the author \
but the site is down and has been for a while The script seems to be unsupported at \
this point.
