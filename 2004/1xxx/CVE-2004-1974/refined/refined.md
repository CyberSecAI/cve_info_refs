The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in paFileDB version 3.1, including full path disclosure and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**1. Full Path Disclosure:**
   - **Root Cause:** The application reveals the server's full path in error messages when specific requests are made.
   - **Weakness:**  Improper error handling, the application is outputting the full path of the application in an error message.
   - **Impact:**  An attacker can learn the full server path, which can be used to facilitate further attacks and gain more knowledge about the system.
   - **Attack Vector:** Sending a specific request with an invalid parameter will cause an error message revealing the full server path.
   - **Attacker Capabilities:**  A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request.

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
   - **Root Cause:** The application does not sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `pafiledb.php` script.
   - **Weakness:** Improper input sanitization of user-controlled data in the `id` parameter.
   - **Impact:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to cookie theft or other client-side attacks.
   - **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious script into the `id` parameter.
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** A remote attacker can inject malicious code by crafting an URL.
