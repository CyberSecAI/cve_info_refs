How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# ClamAV VirusEvent parameter vulnerability — GLSA **200405-03**

With a specific configuration (using %f in the VirusEvent parameter), Clam
AntiVirus is vulnerable to an attack allowing execution of arbitrary
commands.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-antivirus/clamav** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.70** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.70** |

### Background

From http://www.clamav.net/ :

"Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose
of this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded
daemon, a command line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via
Internet. The programs are based on a shared library distributed with
the Clam AntiVirus package, which you can use with your own software.
Most importantly, the virus database is kept up to date."

### Description

The VirusEvent parameter in the clamav.conf configuration file allows
to specify a system command to run whenever a virus is found. This
system command can make use of the "%f" parameter which is replaced by
the name of the file infected. The name of the file scanned is under
control of the attacker and is not sufficiently checked. Version 0.70
of clamav disables the use of the "%f" parameter.

### Impact

Sending a virus with a malicious file name can result in execution of
arbirary system commands with the rights of the antivirus process.
Since clamav is often associated to mail servers for email scanning,
this attack can be used remotely.

### Workaround

You should not use the "%f" parameter in your VirusEvent configuration.

### Resolution

All users of Clam AntiVirus should upgrade to the latest stable
version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.70"
 # emerge ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.70"
```

PARTY ON!  -- l0om -- www.excluded.org   Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:     I suggest to put a note into the ebuild that is displayed after emerging clamav, warning to use the feature since it is VERY risky indeed. According to the advisory, the VirusEvent isn't used by default.  Maybe this is going to be fixed in a later version of clamav. We should leave the bug open until the issue is fixed by the clamav developers. An open security bug is a nice reference and documentation of this issue to Gentoo clamav users.  regards, Tobias W. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-07 11:19:43 UTC  ``` lordvan -- comments? ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-13 03:23:45 UTC  ``` Still waiting for upstream and/or confirmation, apparently they tried to fix a lot of sprintf recently but backed out the patch. Note sure they know about this one precisely.  Maybe we should just patch the current one with a comment warning against the use of %f in VirusEvent in the clamav.conf file ?  -K ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-22 04:50:47 UTC  ``` v0.70 released - drops %f support in VirusEvent. ebuild is already in portage, we just need it stable.  Given the low priority of this bug, we can wait a little before asking arches to review ?  -K ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-29 07:19:29 UTC  ``` We need stable for the net-mail/clamav-0.70 ebuild : arches, please test. -K  ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Andrea Barisani (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-29 07:26:02 UTC  ``` net-mail/clamav-0.70 works fine for me on x86 ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Thomas Raschbacher   gentoo-dev  2004-04-29 12:37:28 UTC  ``` same here. use it for quite a while now. i'll mark stable x86 other archs plz test and mark stable yourselfs.  regards ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Guy Martin (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-29 12:43:56 UTC  ``` Stable on hppa. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Jason Wever (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-29 20:05:25 UTC  ``` Stable on sparc. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Bryan Østergaard (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-29 23:35:28 UTC  ``` Stable on alpha. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Jason Huebel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-30 15:37:24 UTC  ``` stable on amd64 ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-05-04 07:06:15 UTC  ``` Still needing ppc stable for GLSA. -K ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Luca Barbato   gentoo-dev  2004-05-04 11:13:48 UTC  ``` marked ppc, luckly I found a user willing to test it ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-05-04 11:43:53 UTC  ``` Thanks Luca, Ready for a GLSA publication decision then... ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-05-11 12:37:58 UTC  ``` GLSA 200405-03 ``` |  |
