Microsoft Windows Media Player 9 Vulns
======================================
Title:     Microsoft Windows Media Player 9 Vulns (2)
HappyName: MS-WMP9-2P-BY-R/\/\AN
Date:      Friday, April 17, 2004
Software:  Microsoft Windows Media Player 9
Vendor:    Microsoft Corporation
Patch:     Fixed in Microsoft Windows Media Player 10
Author:    Arman Nayyeri, arman-n[at]phreaker[daat]net, <http://www.4rman.com>
Severity:  As little as heaven! (seriously: Moderate)

Description:
============
I have been reported this vulns on "Monday, July 05, 2004 4:11 PM" to microsoft.
They finally corrected these flaws in WMP 10. So I just wait some time for some
people to install WMP 10, now it's showtime!

Windows Media Player Allows Writing To Audio Files: (WMP-AWTAF)
===============================================================
The Windows Media Player allow the name of artist and song be changed by
using windows media player control in Internet explorer,
so it will allow an attacker to overwrite the artist and album and song
name of a music file by finding a mp3 file (for example).
It is not so much important itself but become more important if we can
cause IE to parse the mp3 file then we can easily inject script
in my computer zone, there is some default music files that exists when
windows get installed (ME and XP), so it will become more
easier to exploit.

something like this:
WindowsMediaPlayer.currentMedia.setItemInfo("Artist",'&lt;script&gt;alert("Hello");</'+'script>');

but actually I never found such vuln in IE which cause such severity!
Because I'm so busy, take a look at "I need some help!" section.

So I left it as an exercise for the attacker ;)

Windows Media Player ActiveX Object Expose Existence Of Files: (WMP-AXOEEOF)
============================================================================
There is a way to determine if a file exists and if it exists find it's size. I have
used the getItemInfoByAtom() function with a magical number. the magical number is 19
which actually used to get the file size. But we can open any (music or non-music)
files by WMP ActiveX and call this function on it. it will return 0 if the file does
not exists (or is empty) and return the size if it exists.

Do I discover more vulnerabilities?
===================================
I'm so busy these days.
Read below.

I need some help! HELP!! HELP!! HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
==============================================================================
I'm in the way of my research and I actually need some help about viruses.
let me tell you some about my research:

I'm working on a virus defense system which does not rely on Virus Signatures at all.
I used some ways to defend viruses and trojan when they want to spread or damage the
computer.It's almost 8 months which I started this research. I called it Instantaneous
Defense Technology (IDT). I'm working alone. First of all I want to know if there is
anyone who is interested in supporting me and my research. And if there is someone who
really have nice info in this subject and can help me in this way. The beta version of
a sample program based on IDT will be released in the next 6 months. Also I'm ready to
cooperate with any company which have a nice offer for working in this subject. In march
I will need some virus/trojan samples. If anyone have virus samples or knows how to get
samples contact me. I will continue my research until I get a nice offer.
