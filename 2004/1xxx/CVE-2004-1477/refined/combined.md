## Macromedia JRun Server is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack

#### Vulnerability Note VU#668206

Original Release Date: 2004-10-12 | Last Revised: 2004-10-12

---

### Overview

A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in the Macromedia JRun Server Management Console that may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| JRun is an application server that works with most popular web servers such as Apache and IIS. Macromedia [states](http://www.macromedia.com/software/jrun/productinfo/product_overview/pdf/jr4_product_overview.pdf) that JRun is deployed at over 10,000 organizations worldwide. The JRun Management Console (JMC) is a web-based utility used to manage and configure the JRun Server. There are reports of a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the JMC. According these reports, the JMC fails to filter variables encoded in a URL for malicious content. As a result, a remote attacker may be able to insert and execute arbitrary code within the security context of the JMC site. According to Macromedia only JRun version 4.0 is vulnerable. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the JMC site. If the site is compromised, an attacker may be able to access a user's cookies allowing them to view sensitive information or hijack an authenticated user's session. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**Apply the latest JRun updater:  <http://www.macromedia.com/support/jrun/updaters.html>. |
