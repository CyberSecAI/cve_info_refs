Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way Crystal Reports' web delivery modules handle image requests. Specifically, the modules (crystalimagehandler.aspx, crystalimagehandler.asp, or crystalimagehandler.jsp) accept a `dynamicimage` parameter, which specifies the name of a temporary image file to deliver. These modules do not properly validate or sanitize this parameter, allowing for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is directory traversal. Attackers can use ".." sequences in the `dynamicimage` parameter to access files outside the intended temporary image directory.
*   **Arbitrary File Access:** By exploiting the directory traversal, attackers can access any file on the server's file system that the webserver user has read permissions to.
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** After delivering the file, the module removes it from the disk. Therefore, any file accessed through the directory traversal vulnerability is also deleted.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   Removing critical system files (e.g., win.ini, boot.ini) can lead to system instability and make the system unbootable.
    *   Repeatedly generating reports without retrieving associated images consumes disk space, leading to disk exhaustion and performance degradation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidential Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access and download sensitive files, such as configuration files, source code, or user data.
*   **Data Loss/Modification:** Attackers can delete arbitrary files.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The removal of critical system files renders the server inoperable and the disk space exhaustion can crash the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable image handling modules, manipulating the `dynamicimage` parameter to include directory traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Crystal Reports application.
*   **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs to know or guess the paths of files they want to access. This can be aided by knowledge of typical server operating system configurations and path conventions.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability is present in multiple web delivery technologies (ASP, ASP.NET, and JSP).
* The affected versions include Crystal Reports versions 9 and 10, and Crystal Enterprise versions 9 and 10.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Imperva's Application Defense Center and they attempted to notify Business Objects, the vendor, before public disclosure.
* Business Objects eventually released a security bulletin and patch for this vulnerability on June 8th, 2004.
