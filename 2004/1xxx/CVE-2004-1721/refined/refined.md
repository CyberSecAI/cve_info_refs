Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in Merak Webmail Server as described in the `marc.info` content:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Multiple input validation flaws exist in various parameters across different webmail pages (address.html, settings.html, readmail.html, attachment.html, calendar.html), allowing injection of malicious scripts.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding, allowing attacker-controlled data to be rendered as active code.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Maliciously crafted URLs or HTML messages containing JavaScript code.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially gaining access to cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of the victim, among other things.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker would need to be able to get the victim to click the specially crafted link or read a specially crafted email.

*   **Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper error handling reveals the server's internal file paths in error messages.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper error suppression and insufficient data sanitization before generating error messages.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Maliciously crafted URLs with specific parameters that cause PHP errors.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can determine the absolute path to the web application, aiding further attacks.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Access to the webmail interface to send the malicious requests and view the error messages.

*   **Exposure of PHP files:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The webserver allows direct access to PHP files, which should not be publicly accessible.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Improper web server configuration and missing access controls.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Directly requesting the PHP files via their URL.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can download the PHP source code, potentially revealing sensitive information and further vulnerabilities.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to access the vulnerable URL from the web interface.

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Unsanitized user input is directly included in SQL queries.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization and parameterized queries.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Crafting a malicious SQL query string injected in vulnerable parameters in the calendar.html page.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or modifying database entries.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to access the calendar.html page and manipulate the vulnerable parameters.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory provides detailed examples of vulnerable URLs and parameters for each vulnerability type, including specific payloads.
*   The XSS vulnerability can also be triggered by sending specially crafted HTML emails or including XSS in the subject of the email.
*   The advisory also includes examples of full path disclosure error messages, which reveal internal server paths.
*   The vulnerable software is "Merak Webmail Server" version 5.2.7.
