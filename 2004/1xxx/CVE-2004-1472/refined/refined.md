Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: Denial of Service (DoS) via UDP Port Scan**

*   **Root Cause:** A fast UDP port scan targeting all ports (1-65535) on the WAN interface of the Symantec Enterprise Firewall/VPN appliances causes the device to lock up and stop responding.
*   **Weakness:** The firewall is unable to handle a large volume of UDP packets sent to different ports, causing it to become unresponsive.
*   **Impact:** The firewall becomes unavailable and requires a power cycle to restore functionality, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker can perform a UDP port scan.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the WAN interface of the firewall.

**Vulnerability 2: Filter Bypass on WAN Interface**

*   **Root Cause:** Sending a UDP port scan from source port 53 bypasses filters on the WAN interface, exposing the tftpd, snmpd, and isakmp services.
*   **Weakness:** The firewall's filter mechanism improperly handles UDP packets with a source port of 53, allowing normally restricted services to be accessible.
*   **Impact:** Exposes potentially vulnerable services, such as SNMP, to the WAN, which can be further exploited.
*  **Attack Vector:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker sending UDP packets with a source port of 53 to the WAN interface.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the WAN interface of the firewall.

**Vulnerability 3: Default SNMP Read/Write Community String**

*   **Root Cause:** The firewall uses a default "public" read/write community string for SNMP, allowing unauthorized collection and alteration of the firewall's configuration.
*   **Weakness:** The firewall uses a default SNMP community string and does not allow the administrator to disable the service or change the community string using the administrative interface.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can collect and alter the firewall's configuration, which can have severe consequences for the network's security.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker can send SNMP GET/SET requests from source port UDP 53, bypassing the firewall's filters. This leverages vulnerability 2.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the WAN interface of the firewall and have knowledge of the default SNMP community string.

**Affected Products:**

*   Symantec Enterprise Firewall/VPN Appliances 100, 200, and 200R (prior to firmware build 1.63)
*   Symantec Gateway Security 320, 360, and 360R (prior to build 622)

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to firmware build 1.63 (for Firewall/VPN appliances)
*   Upgrade to firmware build 622 (for Gateway Security products)

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.
*   The denial of service vulnerability affects only the firewall products not the gateway products.
*   The filter bypass and default SNMP community vulnerabilities affect both the firewall and gateway products.
*   The vendor, Symantec, has been credited for reporting the vulnerability and the Rigel Kent Security & Advisory Services for discovering the vulnerability.
*   There is no CVE assigned to this vulnerability according to the CERT/CC vulnerability note, this is likely an oversight as this vulnerability is referenced on multiple other sources (SecurityTracker, SecurityFocus) and has been publicly known since 2004-09-22.
