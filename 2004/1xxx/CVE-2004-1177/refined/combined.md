===========================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-59-1		   January 10, 2005
mailman vulnerabilities
CAN-2004-1177, <http://bugs.debian.org/285839>
===========================================================

A security issue affects the following Ubuntu releases:

Ubuntu 4.10 (Warty Warthog)

The following packages are affected:

mailman

The problem can be corrected by upgrading the affected package to
version 2.1.5-1ubuntu2.2. In general, a standard system upgrade is
sufficient to effect the necessary changes.

Details follow:

Florian Weimer discovered a cross-site scripting vulnerability in
mailman's automatically generated error messages. An attacker could
craft an URL containing JavaScript (or other content embedded into
HTML) which triggered a mailman error page. When an unsuspecting user
followed this URL, the malicious content was copied unmodified to the
error page and executed in the context of this page.

Juha-Matti Tapio discovered an information disclosure in the private
rosters management. Everybody could check whether a specified email
address was subscribed to a private mailing list by looking at the
error message. This bug was Ubuntu/Debian specific.

Important note:

There is currently another known vulnerability: when an user
subscribes to a mailing list without choosing a password, mailman
automatically generates one. However, there are only about 5 million
different possible passwords which allows brute force attacks.

A different password generation algorithm already exists, but is
currently too immature to be put into a stable release security
update. Therefore it is advisable to always explicitly choose a
password for subscriptions, at least until this gets fixed in Warty
Warthog.

See <https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/4892> for details.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 674-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze

Package        : mailman
Vulnerability  : cross-site scripting, directory traversal
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-1177 CAN-2005-0202

Two security related problems have been discovered in mailman,
web-based GNU mailing list manager.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CAN-2004-1177

    Florian Weimer discovered a cross-site scripting vulnerability in
    mailman's automatically generated error messages.  An attacker
    could craft an URL containing JavaScript (or other content
    embedded into HTML) which triggered a mailman error page that
    would include the malicious code verbatim.

CAN-2005-0202

    Several listmasters have noticed unauthorised access to archives
    of private lists and the list configuration itself, including the
    users passwords.  Administrators are advised to check the
    webserver logfiles for requests that contain "/...../" and the
    path to the archives or cofiguration.  This does only seem to
    affect installations running on web servers that do not strip
    slashes, such as Apache 1.3.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.11-1woody9.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.5-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your mailman package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Package: mailman
Severity: grave

Justification: user security hole

scripts/driver does not properly escape the <>& characters when it
prints the environment once an error is detected.

A fix has been committed to the Mailman CVS repository.  My patch for
this issue is attached below.

(I'm not sure if woody is affected or not.)

Changes:
 mailman (2.1.5-5) unstable; urgency=high
 .
   * Fix CAN-2004-1143 (weak auto-generated passwords) by pulling the
     appropriate CVS change from upstream.  Thanks to Florian Weimer for
     finding and producing a patch for this bug.  (closes: #[286796](bugreport.cgi?bug=286796))
   * Fix CAN-2004-1177 (CSS problem in scripts/driver) by pulling the
     appropriate patch from upstream CVS.  Thanks to Florian Weimer for
     discovering and producing a patch for this bug.  (closes: #[287555](bugreport.cgi?bug=287555))
   * Handle the case of upgrading from Mailman 2.0 where we have
     pending subscriptions.  This should hopefully fix #280529.  Thanks to
     Bastian Kleinedam for the patch.  (closes: #[280529](bugreport.cgi?bug=280529))
   * Skip directories when updating templates, to make the life easier for
     people who have their configuration in Subversion or Arch.
     (closes: #[284771](bugreport.cgi?bug=284771))
   * Remove 55_options_traceback.dpatch as this problem seems to have been
     fixed upstream and it causes other problems.  (closes: #[285839](bugreport.cgi?bug=285839))
