The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in Props 0.6.1: Remote File Viewing and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**1. Remote File Viewing:**

*   **Root cause:** The `glossary_init()` function in `lib/glossary.php` does not sanitize the `module` and `format` variables obtained from the URL.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation/sanitization on user-supplied parameters `module` and `format`. This allows path traversal by using `../` in the module parameter.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can view arbitrary files on the server by crafting a malicious URL. The example provided shows how to view the source code of `config.php`.
*   **Attack vector:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP GET request by manipulating the `module` and `format` parameters.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication or special privileges are required.

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   **Root cause:** The `do_search()` function in `archives/lib/do_search.php` does not properly sanitize the `search_string` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient sanitization of user input. Specifically, the code attempts to remove semicolons and add slashes but does not prevent arbitrary javascript execution through the search query.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the webpage, which can be executed in the victim's browser leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vector:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP GET request by manipulating the `search_string` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication or special privileges are required.

The content also provides the fixes for these vulnerabilities:
* For the remote file viewing vulnerability the fix involves sanitizing the `module` parameter to only allow alphanumeric characters and underscores. The format parameter is validated against a list of allowed mime types.
* For the XSS vulnerability the fix involves sanitizing the `search_string` parameter to remove all characters except alphanumeric characters, underscores, commas, and periods.
