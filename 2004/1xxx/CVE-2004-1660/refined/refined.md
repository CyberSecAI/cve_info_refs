  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Insecure file permissions and PHP include vulnerabilities.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The documentation instructs users to CHMOD the cutenews/data/ directory and its contents to 777, which allows world-writable access. This could potentially allow an attacker to modify files within the data directory.",
        "Multiple PHP include vulnerabilities exist, allowing remote users to execute PHP code with web server privileges."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code with the privileges of the web server. XSS vulnerabilities are also present.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By modifying some php require() calls to execute remote php files located on an attacker's server. This can be achieved via the `cutepath` parameter in `show_archives.php` and `show_news.php`",
          "By exploiting the insecure file permissions, an attacker could potentially modify configuration files or other critical data."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable web server. Additionally, the attacker requires a web server to host the malicious php files to include, and know the vulnerable URLs on the target."
