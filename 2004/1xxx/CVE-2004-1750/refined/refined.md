{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The RealVNC server is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to an issue where it crashes when it receives more than 60 connections.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the server's inability to handle a high number of connections, specifically exceeding 60. This suggests a lack of proper resource management or a flaw in connection handling logic.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit results in the RealVNC server crashing, which leads to a denial of service. This prevents legitimate users from connecting to or using the remote access server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can initiate multiple (more than 60) TCP connections to the RealVNC server's port (5900 by default).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the target server, and the ability to establish TCP connections to the RealVNC service."
