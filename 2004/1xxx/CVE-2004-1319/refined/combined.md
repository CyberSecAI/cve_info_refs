How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft Internet Explorer DHTML Editing ActiveX control contains a cross-domain vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#356600

Original Release Date: 2005-01-05 | Last Revised: 2005-02-17

---

### Overview

A cross-domain vulnerability exists in the DHTML Editing ActiveX control. An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary script in the Local Machine Zone or read or modify data in other domains. For example, the attacker could execute arbitrary commands with parameters, download and execute arbitrary code, read cookies, spoof content, or modify form behavior.

### Description

| **The Cross-Domain Security Model**  IE uses a cross-domain security model to maintain separation between browser frames from different sources. This model is designed to prevent code in one domain from accessing data in a different domain. The [Internet Security Manager Object](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/security/szone/reference/objects/internetsecuritymanager.asp) determines which zone or domain a URL exists in and what actions can be performed. From Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-048](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-048.asp):*One of the principal security functions of a browser is to ensure that browser windows that are under the control of different Web sites cannot interfere with each other or access each other's data, while allowing windows from the same site to interact with each other. To differentiate between cooperative and uncooperative browser windows, the concept of a "domain" has been created. A domain is a security boundary - any open windows within the same domain can interact with each other, but windows from different domains cannot. The cross-domain security model is the part of the security architecture that keeps windows from different domains from interfering with each other.***The DHTML Editing Control**The [DHTML Editing Control](http://activex.microsoft.com/activex/controls/dhtmled/dhtmled.asp) is a wrapper for the [MSHTML editor](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnmshtml/html/mshtmleditplatf.asp). It is an ActiveX control that provides the ability to perform text and HTML editing functions. The control is marked "safe for scripting," which means that the DHTML Editing Control could be called from Internet Explorer. The LoadURL method, which is traditionally used to open web page content in the DHTML Editing Control, will only open documents in the same domain as the host page. When used with a certain combination of script commands, the DHTML Editing Control can open the content of an arbitrary web page in any domain, regardless of the domain of the host page. **The Problem**The DHTML Editing Control is vulnerable to a cross-domain violation. When the DHTML Editing Control opens the content from a website, it appears to operate within the security context of that website. While the DHTML Editing Control has the security context of the opened site, the DHTML Editing Control is under full control of the page that hosts it. Working indirectly through the DHTML Editing Control, a website in one domain has the ability to access information in another domain or zone. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message), an attacker may be able to execute script in the Local Machine Zone. Script that executes in the Local Machine Zone can be used to download and execute arbitrary code. An attacker may obtain full access to web content in another domain, which may reside in a different security zone. The impact is similar to that of a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This includes the ability to spoof or modify web content, access website information such as cookies, or retrieve data from an encrypted HTTPS connection. For a more detailed description of the impact of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, please see CERT Advisory [CA-2000-02](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html#impact). |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Install an update**Install the update referenced in [MS05-013](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-013.mspx). With this update, the cross-domain security model is enforced with the DHTML Editing Control. |
| --- |

| **Disable the DHTML Editing Control**Disable the DHTML Editing Control by setting the kill bit as described in [Microsoft Knowledge Base article 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). The CLSID for the DHTML Editing Control is:{2D360201-FFF5-11d1-8D03-00A0C959BC0A}Note that disabling the DHTML Editing Control may prevent Outlook Web Access (OWA) from functioning properly.**Disable Active scripting and ActiveX**Disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. With ActiveX controls disabled, the DHTML Editing Control will not be instantiated. Instructions for disabling Active scripting in the Internet Zone can be found in the [Malicious Web Scripts FAQ](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_FAQ.html#ie56). See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [833633](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=833633) for information about securing the Local Machine Zone, and [315933](http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=315933) for information about displaying the Local Machine Zone (My Computer security zone) on the Security tab in the Internet Options dialog box.Note that disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone will reduce the functionality of some web sites. Disabling these features in the Local Machine Zone will reduce the functionality of some programs, including the Help and Support Center in Windows XP.**Install Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2)**Microsoft [Windows XP SP2](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/sp2preview.mspx) includes a feature called [Local Machine Zone Lockdown](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/sp2brows.mspx#EHAA), as well as other improvements. The Local Machine Zone Lockdown prevents Internet Explorer and several other programs from evaluating script in the Local Machine Zone. While this does not remove the vulnerability, it does help prevent an attacker from executing script in the Local Machine Zone.**Apply the Outlook Email Security Update**Another way to effectively disable Active scripting in Outlook is to install the Outlook Email Security Update. The update configures Outlook to open email messages in the Restricted Sites Zone, where Active scripting is disabled by default. In addition, the update provides further protection against malicious code that attempts to propagate via Outlook. The Outlook Email Security Update is available for [Outlook 98](http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/9798/Out98sec.aspx) and [Outlook 2000](http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/Out2ksec.aspx). The functionality of the Outlook Email Security Update is included in Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6. Outlook 2003 includes these and other security enhancements.**Read and send email in plain text format**Outlook 2003, Outlook 2002 SP1, and Outlook 6 SP1 can be configured to view email messages in text format. Consider the security of fellow Internet users and send email in plain text format when possible. Note that reading and sending email in plain text will not necessarily prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.**Do not follow unsolicited links**In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting.**Use a different web browser** There are a number of significant vulnerabilities in technologies relating to the IE domain/zone security model, local file system (Local Machine Zone) trust, the Dynamic HTML (DHTML) document object model (in particular, proprietary DHTML features), the HTML Help system, MIME type determination, the graphical user interface (GUI), and ActiveX. These technologies are implemented in operating system libraries that are used by IE and many other programs to provide web browser functionality. IE is integrated into Windows to such an extent that vulnerabilities in IE frequently provide an attacker significant access to the operating system.It is possible to reduce exposure to these vulnerabilities by using a different web browser, especially when viewing untrusted HTML documents (e.g., web sites, HTML email messages). Such a decision may, however, reduce the functionality of sites that require IE-specific features such as proprietary DHTML, VBScript, and ActiveX. Note that using a different web browser will not remove IE from a Windows system, and other programs may invoke IE, the WebBrowser ActiveX control (WebOC), or the HTML rendering engine (MSHTML). |

For more information, see the [Windows Operating System Product Support Lifecycle FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33330).

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx). This mode mitigates this issue.

**What is Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?**

[Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx) is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or of an administrator downloading and running malicious Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying many security-related settings. This includes the settings on the **Security** and the **Advanced** tab in the **Internet Options** dialog box. Some of the important modifications include the following:

* Security level for the Internet zone is set to High. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), and file downloads.
* Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.
* Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.
* Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows XP Service Pack 2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. Windows XP Service Pack 2 introduced a security enhancement known as the [Local Machine zone lockdown](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms537183%28vs.85%29.aspx) that mitigates this vulnerability.

**What is the Local Machine zone lockdown?**

In Windows XP Service Pack 2, all local files and content that are processed by Internet Explorer has additional security applied to it in the Local Machine zone. This feature restricts HTML in the Local Machine zone. This feature also restricts HTML that is hosted in Internet Explorer. These restrictions help mitigate attacks where the Local Machine zone is used as an attack vector to load malicious HTML code.

Because of this change, ActiveX script in local HTML pages that are viewed inside Internet Explorer will not run. Also, script in local HTML pages that are viewed inside Internet Explorer prompts the user for permission to run.

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA will determine whether this update is required. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**Note** After April 20, 2004, the Mssecure.xml file that is used by MBSA 1.1.1 and earlier versions is no longer being updated with new security bulletin data. Therefore, scans that are performed after that date by using MBSA 1.1.1 or earlier will be incomplete. All users should upgrade to MBSA 1.2 because it provides more accurate security update detection and supports additional products. Users can download MBSA 1.2.1 from the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about MBSA support, visit the following [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer 1.2.1 Q&A; Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33332).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

The Security Update Inventory Tool is required for detecting Microsoft Windows and other affected Microsoft products. For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460).

## Vulnerability Details

#### DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control Cross Domain Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1319:

A cross-domain vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Dynamic HTML (DHTML) Editing Component ActiveX control that could allow information disclosure or remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited that page. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control Cross Domain Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1319:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also attempt to compromise a Web site to have it display a Web page with malicious content. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, Microsoft Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2000, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms04-018) has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability.

  The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

  + Install the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-040](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-040) or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
  + Use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or a later version in its default configuration, or use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or a later version in its default configuration.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this security update for more information about [Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx).
* Windows XP Service Pack 2 introduced a security enhancement known as the [Local Machine zone lockdown.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms537183%28vs.85%29.aspx) This security enhancement mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this security update for more information about Local Machine zone lockdown.

#### Workarounds for DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control Cross Domain Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1319:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to prompt before running ActiveX controls and active scripting in these zones.**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and active scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the high security setting.

  Alternatively, you can change you settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls only. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings,** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins,** click **Prompt**.
  5. In the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**, and then click **OK**.
  6. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  7. Under **Settings**, in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt**.
  8. In the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**.
  9. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the "Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites" workaround.
* **Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and active scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.
* **Install the update that is described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018 if you are using Outlook Express 5.5 SP2.**

  Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed.

  Customers running Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 who have installed Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.
* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version , to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed, or view e-mail messages that are not encrypted, in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about enabling this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
* **Temporarily disable the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control from running in Internet Explorer for Windows XP Service Pack 2.**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by temporarily disabling the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control from running in Internet Explorer. On Windows XP Service Pack 2 use the Internet Explorer Manage Add-ons feature to disable the ActiveX control.

  1. Start Internet Explorer.
  2. On the **Tools** menu, click **Manage Add-ons.**
  3. Locate and click on "DHTML Edit Control Safe for Scripting for IE5".
  4. To disable the add-on, click **Disable**, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you cannot locate the ActiveX control then use the drop-down box to switch from "Add-ons currently being used in Internet Explorer" to "Add-ons that have been used by Internet Explorer" and follow steps 3 and 4. If the ActiveX control is not present in this list either you have not used the ActiveX control before. See the workaround "Temporarily disable the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control from running in Internet Explorer" for additional information.

  **Note** If you use this workaround, you must re-enable this ActiveX control. You should do this after you have applied this security update to regain the functionality that is supplied by the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control.

  For more information on the Internet Explorer Manage Add-ons feature in Windows XP Service Pack 2, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 883256](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/883256).

  **Impact of Workaround:** Disabling the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX control prevents Internet Explorer from instantiating the control. This configuration causes program compatibility issues. Some examples of such issues include the following:

  + You cannot compose e-mail messages in Outlook Web Access for Exchange 2000 Server and Exchange Server 2003.
  + You cannot use Windows SharePoint Services for Windows Server 2003. This product uses the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX control for dynamic Web site HTML editing.
  + Other Web sites may rely on this ActiveX control for dynamic Web site HTML editing.
* **Temporarily disable the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control from running in Internet Explorer.**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by temporarily disabling the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control from running in Internet Explorer. To do this, set the kill bit for the control.
  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require that you reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  The class identifier (CLSID) for an ActiveX control is a GUID for that control. You can prevent an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit so that the control is never called by Internet Explorer. The kill bit is a specific value for the Compatibility Flags DWORD value for the ActiveX control in the registry.
  The CLSID for the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control is {2D360201-FFF5-11D1-8D03-00A0C959BC0A}.
  For detailed steps that describe how to stop an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow the steps in that article and create a Compatibility Flags DWORD value in the registry to prevent the affected control from being instantiated in Internet Explorer
  **Note** If you use this workaround, you must reset this registry change by removing the same Compatibility Flags **DWORD value** from the registry. You should do this after you have applied this security update to regain the functionality that is supplied by the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Disabling the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX control prevents Internet Explorer from instantiating the control. This configuration causes program compatibility issues. Some examples of such issues include the following:

  + You cannot compose e-mail messages in Outlook Web Access for Exchange 2000 Server and Exchange Server 2003.
  + You cannot use Windows SharePoint Services for Windows Server 2003. This product uses the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX control for dynamic Web site HTML editing.
  + Other Web sites may rely on this ActiveX control for dynamic Web site HTML editing.

#### FAQ for DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control Cross Domain Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1319:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a cross-domain vulnerability that could allow information disclosure or remote code execution. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative privileges.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The process by which certain functions that are available through the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control are validated by the Internet Explorer cross-domain security model.

**What is DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control?**

The DHTML Editing Component ActiveX control provides an HTML editor that you can use to support dynamic Web site HTML editing in software. For more information about the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX control, see the [product documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/archive/samples/internet/browser/editcntrl/default.asp).

**What are Internet Explorer security zones?**

Internet Explorer [security zones](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/174360) are part of a system that divides online content into categories or zones based on the trustworthiness of the content. Specific Web domains can be assigned to a zone, depending on how much trust is put in the content of each domain. The zone then restricts the capabilities of the Web content, based on the zone's policy. By default, most Internet domains are treated as part of the Internet zone. By default, the policy of the Internet zone prevents scripts and other active code from accessing resources on the local system.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run malicious script code in the Local Machine security zone in Internet Explorer. This could allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious Web page or an HTML e-mail message and then persuading the user to visit this page or to view the HTML e-mail message. When the user visited the page or viewed the e-mail message, the attacker could access information from other Web sites, local files on the system, or cause script to run in the security context of the Local Machine zone.

By default, Microsoft Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2000, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms04-018) has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user view a Web site or open HTML e-mail messages in a less restrictive Internet Explorer security zone than the Restricted sites zone for malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as users' workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows XP Service Pack 2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. Windows XP Service Pack 2 introduced a security enhancement known as the [Local Machine zone lockdown](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms537183%28vs.85%29.aspx) that mitigates this vulnerability.

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by one or more of the vulnerabilities that are addressed in this security bulletin?**

Yes. Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition are critically affected by this vulnerability. A Critical security update for these platforms is available, is provided as part of this security bulletin, and can be downloaded only from the [Windows Update Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130).

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB891781\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 891781 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
