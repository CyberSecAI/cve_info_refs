    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2004-1493",
      "is_relevant": true,
      "summary": "Master of Orion III versions 1.2.5 and earlier suffer from multiple vulnerabilities that can be exploited remotely via the game's server.",
      "root_cause": "The game fails to properly validate data size and handle long nicknames during network communication.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        {
          "weakness": "Allocation error due to insufficient data size validation.",
           "details": "The game allocates memory based on a 32-bit size value received in network packets. If this value is too large, memory allocation fails, leading to a crash.",
          "impact": "Denial of service. The game server terminates upon encountering an overly large size value, thus disrupting service.",
          "attack_vector": "Sending crafted network packets with a large size field to the server.",
          "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the game server."

        {
         "weakness":"Insufficient protection against buffer overflows when processing nicknames.",
          "details": "The game implements some buffer overflow protections. However, an attacker can bypass them by making multiple consecutive connections with very large nicknames. This will eventually crash the game server.",
          "impact": "Denial of service. The game server crashes when many connections with large nicknames are used.",
          "attack_vector":"Establishing multiple, consecutive network connections with large nicknames to the server.",
         "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the game server."
