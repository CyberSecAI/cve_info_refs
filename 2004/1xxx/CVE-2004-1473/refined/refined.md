Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2004-1473:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The core issue lies in the improper filtering of UDP traffic on the WAN interface of Symantec's firewall and gateway security appliances. Specifically, the devices fail to properly filter packets with a source port of UDP 53. This allows attackers to bypass configured access restrictions and reach services like tftpd, snmpd, and isakmp that should be protected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **UDP Port Scan Denial of Service (DoS):** A rapid UDP port scan on the WAN interface of the firewall appliances can cause a device lockup. This does not affect gateway devices. (RK-001-04-01).
2.  **WAN Interface Filter Bypass:** A UDP port scan with a source port of 53 bypasses the firewall's filtering rules, exposing services like tftpd, snmpd, and isakmp on the WAN interface. (RK-001-04-02).
3.  **Default SNMP Community String:** The devices use a default "public" read/write community string for SNMP, which, combined with the filter bypass, allows remote attackers to collect and modify the firewall's configuration. The administrative interface for the firewall does not allow changing the community strings nor disabling the service. (RK-001-04-03).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** The DoS vulnerability can render the firewall unresponsive, interrupting network services and requiring a power cycle to restore functionality.
*   **Service Exposure:** The filter bypass exposes internal services that should not be accessible from the WAN, potentially revealing sensitive information or creating avenues for further attacks.
*   **Configuration Manipulation:** Using the default SNMP community string, attackers can obtain and alter the firewall's configuration, allowing for a complete compromise of the device and its security policies.
*   **Full Compromise:** This combination of vulnerabilities enables an attacker to gain a foothold by bypassing the firewall, manipulating configurations, and potentially gaining further access into the network behind the firewall.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** All of the vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable via the WAN interface of the affected devices.
*   **UDP Port Scan:**  Attackers use UDP port scans against the WAN interface to exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the WAN interface of the vulnerable Symantec appliances.
*   **UDP Packet Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted UDP packets, specifically with a source port of 53, to exploit the filter bypass vulnerability.
*   **SNMP Knowledge:** To fully exploit the configuration manipulation vulnerability, the attacker needs knowledge of SNMP and its related GET/SET requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory indicates that the Symantec Enterprise Firewall/VPN Appliances (100, 200, 200R) and Symantec Gateway Security (320, 360, 360R) products are affected.
*   The vulnerabilities were addressed with firmware updates. The fix is firmware build 1.63 for the 100, 200, and 200R appliances, and build 622 for the 320, 360, and 360R gateway devices.
*  The CERT vulnerability note (VU#329230) and the Rigel Kent Security Advisory (RK-001-04) confirm that the primary vulnerability is the filter bypass using UDP source port 53. The secondary vulnerability is the default "public" community string for SNMP access, which combined with the UDP 53 filter bypass enables unauthorized device configuration access.
