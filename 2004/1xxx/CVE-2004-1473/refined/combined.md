How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

"Multiple Vulnerabilities in Symantec Enterprise Firewall/Gateway Security
Products"

  Platform	:	Symantec Enterprise Firewall/VPN Appliances
			100, 200, 200R
			Symantec Gateway Security 320
			Symantec Gateway Security 320, 360, 360R

  Version	:     100, 200, 200R
				Prior to firmware build 1.63
			320, 360, 360R
				Prior to build 622

  Configuration	:	Default

Abstract:
========

  Three high-risk vulnerabilities have been identified in the Symantec
  Enterprise Firewall products and two in the Gateway products. All are
  remotely exploitable and allow an attacker to perform a denial of service
  attack against the firewall, identify active services in the WAN interface
  and exploit one of these services to collect and alter the firewall or
  gateway's configuration.

Vulnerabilities:
===============

  Issue RK-001-04-01:
	Denial of service caused by a fast UDP port scan
    Severity:
	High
    Description:
	A fast map UDP port scan against all ports (i.e. 1-65535) on the WAN
	interface of the firewall will cause the firewall to lock up and
stop
	responding. Turning the power off and on will reset the firewall.

	The Gateway Security products are not affected by this issue.
    Countermeasure:
	Install firmware build 1.63

  Issue RK-001-04-02:
	Filter bypass on WAN interface
    Severity:
	High
    Description:
	A UDP port scan against the WAN interface of the firewall from a
source
	port of UDP 53 bypasses filter on WAN interface and exposes the
following
	active services,

		tftpd
		snmpd
		isakmp

	All other ports are reported as closed.
    Countermeasure:
	100, 200, 200R
		Install firmware build 1.63
	320, 360, 360R
		Install firmware build 622

  Issue RK-001-04-03:
	Default read/write community string on SNMP service
    Severity:
	High
    Description:
	The default read/write community string used by the firewall is
public,
	allowing an attacker to collect and alter the firewall's
configuration.
	By combining this with RK-001-04-02, an attacker is able to exploit
this
	against the WAN interface by sending SNMP GET/SET requests whose
source
	port is UDP 53.

	Moreover, the administrative interface for the firewall does not
allow the
	operator to disable the service nor change the community strings.
    Countermeasure:
	100, 200, 200R
		Install firmware build 1.63
	320, 360, 360R
		Install firmware build 622

## Multiple Symantec security appliances fail to properly filter port 53/udp traffic

#### Vulnerability Note VU#329230

Original Release Date: 2004-10-20 | Last Revised: 2004-10-20

---

### Overview

A vulnerability exists in multiple Symantec security appliances that could allow a remote attacker to bypass the firewall using a source port of 53/udp.

### Description

| Symantec's Firewall/VPN appliances and Gateway Security models include a number of services such as tftpd, snmpd, and isakmp. Access to these services from the WAN interface can be restricted through the use of the packet filtering feature of the device. The packet filtering feature contains a vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to successfully connect to one of these services by specifying a source port of 53/udp.  **Affected Products:**     + Symantec Firewall/VPN Appliance 100 (firmware builds prior to build 1.63) + Symantec Firewall/VPN Appliance 200/200R (firmware builds prior to build 1.63) + Symantec Gateway Security 320 (firmware builds prior to build 622) + Symantec Gateway Security 360/360R (firmware builds prior to build 622) |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to establish connections to services in violation of security policies. As a result, an attacker could send packets to these services that are configured to be unreachable from the WAN interface. An attacker could also leverage this flaw to exploit a vulnerability in one of these services. For instance, there is a vulnerability in the Firewall/VPN and Gateway Security appliances that allows a remote attacker to read and modify any SNMP object present on an affected device ([VU#173910](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/173910)). |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade Firmware**According to the [Symantec Advisory](http://www.sarc.com/avcenter/security/Content/2004.09.22.html), product specific firmware and hotfixes are available via the Symantec Enterprise Support site.<http://www.symantec.com/techsupp/> |
