- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The GIMPS, SETI@home, and ChessBrain ebuilds install user-owned binaries and init scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper file ownership. User-owned files are executed with root privileges by init scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local privilege escalation, potentially leading to a root compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through the execution of user-owned files by root-privileged init scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to modify user-owned files on the system.
