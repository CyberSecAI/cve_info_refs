Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described in the context of CVE-2004-1987:

**Vulnerability Overview:**

This document details multiple vulnerabilities discovered in Coppermine Photo Gallery versions 1.2.2b and 1.2.0 RC4 when used with PhpNuke. The vulnerabilities can lead to information disclosure, cross-site scripting, arbitrary directory browsing, arbitrary command execution, and remote file inclusion.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **A. Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Many scripts in Coppermine are directly accessible and do not prevent PHP error messages, revealing the full server path to the scripts.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of access control and error handling on script files.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure of the server's file system structure, valuable for attackers in subsequent attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to vulnerable PHP scripts via HTTP requests.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** No special capabilities are needed to trigger the error messages, basic web access is enough.

*   **B. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `CPG_URL` parameter in `menu.inc.php` is vulnerable to XSS attacks.
    *   **Weakness:** Inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input.
    *   **Impact:** Stealing cookies and performing other unauthorized operations within the browser, compromising user sessions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafted URL with malicious JavaScript code injected into the `CPG_URL` parameter.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** Ability to craft specific URLs.

*   **C. Arbitrary Directory Browsing:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper input validation in the `startdir` parameter of `searchnew.php`.
    *   **Weakness:** Inadequate input sanitization.
    *  **Impact:** An attacker can view the directory structure of the server
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafted URL with `../` sequences in the `startdir` parameter to traverse directories.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** This vulnerability needs the user to have PhpNuke admin rights.

*   **D. Arbitrary Shell Command Execution:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `exec()` function in `picmgmtbatch.inc.php` uses configuration variables which are not sanitized.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper sanitization of configuration variables within the `exec()` function used for image processing.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary shell commands on the server, potentially leading to complete server compromise.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with PhpNuke admin rights modifies the `impath` configuration setting to inject shell commands. These commands are then executed when images are processed.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Requires PhpNuke admin access to modify Coppermine configurations.

*   **E. Remote File Inclusion:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Vulnerable scripts include external files using user-supplied parameters.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization allowing for inclusion of files from external servers.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary PHP code execution, shell command injection, and potential complete server compromise.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Crafted URL with malicious URLs in parameters like `CPG_M_DIR` (old version) or `THEME_DIR` (new version), pointing to malicious PHP scripts on a remote server.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to host and serve the malicious PHP scripts remotely.

**Additional Points:**

*   The advisory notes that obtaining PhpNuke admin rights is a prerequisite for exploiting some vulnerabilities.
*   The report includes examples of how to exploit each vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability report was published on May 2, 2004, by Janek Vind "waraxe."
