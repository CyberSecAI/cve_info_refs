Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Adobe Acrobat/Reader 6 introduced a new way to embed Macromedia Flash files (SWF) directly into PDF files.
*   When a PDF with an embedded SWF is opened, Adobe Reader extracts the SWF file and saves it to the user's temporary directory.
*   The PDF then "links" to this saved SWF, effectively making the local hard drive the codebase for the SWF.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Local File Access:** Because the SWF is treated as if it originates from the local system, it gains read access to all files on the user's hard drive. This bypasses the intended security restrictions of a browser and enables a malicious SWF to read local files.
*   **Implicit Trust:** By extracting and linking to the local copy of the SWF file, the application implicitly trusts the SWF and grants it privileges it would not normally have.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local File Stealing:** A malicious actor can embed a specially crafted SWF file into a PDF. When the user opens this PDF, the SWF can read local files such as cookie files or sensitive documents.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The attacker gains unauthorized access to potentially sensitive information stored locally on the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF Files:** An attacker can create a PDF file containing a malicious embedded SWF file.
*   **Website Operators:** Malicious website operators can host these malicious PDF files on their sites. Users could be tricked into downloading and opening these files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create PDF documents:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify PDF documents to embed the malicious SWF.
*   **Ability to host or distribute malicious PDFs:** The attacker needs to get the malicious PDF in front of a target user through a website, email, or other means.
*   **Knowledge of SWF exploitation:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious SWF file that can read local files when executed from the local file system.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Reader 6 and Adobe Acrobat 6.
*   The user's temporary directory is typically located at `C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Local Settings\Temp` on Windows XP and 2000.
*   The issue can be mitigated by disallowing multimedia operations within Adobe's "Trust Manager" settings in IE but it does not mitigate the issue if another browser is used.
