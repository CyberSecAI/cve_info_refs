The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in Merak Webmail Server version 5.2.7.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Numerous input validation vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into various parameters of different webmail pages (e.g., address.html, settings.html, readmail.html, calendar.html, attachment.html). The injected scripts can be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to cookie theft and other malicious actions. XSS can be injected via URL parameters or directly within the email message body and subject.
    *   **Root cause:** Lack of proper input sanitization/validation of user-supplied data.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper neutralization of user-supplied input.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking via cookie theft, arbitrary actions on user's behalf.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Crafted URLs, malicious email messages.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to craft and send malicious URLs or emails to a victim using Merak Webmail Server.

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** Certain parameters in `address.html` and `calendar.html` can cause PHP errors that reveal the server's installation path.
    *   **Root cause:** Lack of input validation leading to PHP errors that disclose file system paths.
    *   **Weakness:** Information exposure.
    *   **Impact:** Provides information about the server's filesystem which can be used in further attacks.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Crafted URLs.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to make HTTP requests to the Merak Webmail Server.

*   **Exposure of PHP Files:** The server allows direct download of PHP files.
    *   **Root cause:** Improper configuration/access control that allows direct access to php files.
    *   **Weakness:** Information exposure.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of source code, potentially including sensitive information.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Direct HTTP request to php files
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to make HTTP requests to the Merak Webmail Server.

*   **SQL Injection:** Vulnerable parameters in `calendar.html` allow injection of SQL commands.
    *   **Root cause:** Lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input when constructing SQL queries.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for data breach or manipulation, depending on the underlying database access rights.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Crafted URLs
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to make HTTP requests to the Merak Webmail Server.
