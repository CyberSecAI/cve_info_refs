{
  "CVE-2004-1235": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists in the `load_elf_library()` and `binfmt_aout()` functions within the Linux kernel's binary format loader layer.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `load_elf_library()` function creates a brk segment (VMA) without holding the `current->mm->mmap_sem` semaphore while modifying the memory layout of the calling process. The `do_brk()` function must be called with the `mmap` semaphore held, leading to a race condition. This can lead to a corrupted memory layout.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this race condition may allow local users to gain elevated (root) privileges. It can also allow privilege escalation, potentially breaking out of virtual machines.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation using crafted binaries to trigger the race condition during library loading.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local unprivileged user capable of executing code. The attacker needs to trigger the vulnerable code paths and win the race condition.",
    "Additional Technical Details": [
      "The vulnerability is located in `fs/binfmt_elf.c` and related files.",
      "The `do_brk()` function is called after releasing the `mmap_sem` in `load_elf_library()`.",
      "The `kmem_cache_alloc()` call in `do_brk()` may sleep, allowing a different thread to modify the VMA list and RB-tree.",
      "Exploitation can be achieved through memory exhaustion, leading to wrong insertion into the VMA list or RB-tree.",
      "Several exploitation vectors exist, including page reference counters and 'ghost PTEs'."
