NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: Oracle 10g TNS Listener DoS
Systems Affected: Oracle 10g on all operating systems
Severity: High risk on high availability systems else low
Vendor URL: <http://www.oracle.com/>
Author: David Litchfield [ davidl at ngssoftware.com ]
Relates to: <http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/oracle-01.txt>
Date of Public Advisory: 23rd December 2004
Advisory number: #NISR2122004F
Advisory URL: <http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/oracle23122004F.txt>

Description
***********
The 10g Oracle TNS Listener is vulnerable to a denial of service
vulnerability.

Details
*******
This occurs by sending the Listener a malformed service_register_NSGR
request. Byte 182 of the request is used as an offset to a pointer; in a
normal request this byte's value is 5 but by setting it to say 0xCC an
attacker can get the Listener to access (read) an arbitrary value which
causes the Listener to access violate/core dump.

Fix Information
***************
A patch (#68) was released for this problem by Oracle. See
<http://metalink.oracle.com/> for more details. NGSSQuirreL for Oracle
(<http://www.nextgenss.com/squirrelora.htm>), can be used to assess whether
your Oracle servers are vulnerable to this.
