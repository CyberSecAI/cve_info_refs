       "details": "The Oracle 10g TNS Listener is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. This is caused by sending a malformed service_register_NSGR request. Byte 182 of the request is used as an offset to a pointer. By setting this byte to an arbitrary value, such as 0xCC, an attacker can cause the Listener to access an arbitrary memory location, leading to a core dump.",
