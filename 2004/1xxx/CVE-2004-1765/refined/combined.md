# OWASPModsecurity Project

![Rules protecting a safe](/images/plugged.png)
## The 1st Line of Defense

[ModSecurity](https://www.modsecurity.org/) is an open source, cross-platform web application firewall (WAF) module.
Known as the ‚ÄúSwiss Army Knife‚Äù of WAFs, it enables web application defenders to gain
visibility into HTTP(S) traffic and provides a power rules language and API to implement
advanced protections.

[Get latest v3: 3.0.13](https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/releases/tag/v3.0.13)
## The most widespread open source WAF

Used by businesses, government organizations, internet service providers, and commercial WAF vendors alike on
millions of domains all over the world. The engine, coupled with OWASP CRS - the dominant WAF rule set,
undeniably raises the level of protection against HTTP attacks to a higher level.

[Become a part of it!](/developers/)
## ModSecurity under OWASP's custodianship

OWASP¬Æ Foundation, the leading open community dedicated to application security, is already responsible for the Core Rule Set,
the dominant WAF rule set on the market. By joining the ModSecurity WAF to their repertoire, OWASP can now steer ModSecurity‚Äôs
development with a holistic view, fostering even tighter integration between the core rule set and the underlying framework.![Rules protecting a safe](/images/owasp/logo.png)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
