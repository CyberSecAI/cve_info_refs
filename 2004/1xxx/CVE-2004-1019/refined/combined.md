     Advisory: Multiple vulnerabilities within PHP 4/5
 Release Date: 2004/12/15
Last Modified: 2004/12/15
       Author: Stefan Esser [sesser@php.net]

  Application: PHP4 <= 4.3.9
               PHP5 <= 5.0.2
     Severity: Several vulnerabilities within PHP allow
               local and remote execution of arbitrary code
         Risk: Critical
Vendor Status: Vendor has released bugfixed versions.
   References: <http://www.hardened-php.net/advisories/012004.txt>

Overview:

   PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
   especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

   During the development of Hardened-PHP which adds security hardening
   features to the PHP codebase, several vulnerabilities within PHP
   were discovered that reach from bufferoverflows, over information
   leak vulnerabilities and path truncation vulnerabilities to
   safe_mode restriction bypass vulnerabilities.

Details:

   [01 - pack() - integer overflow leading to heap bufferoverflow ]

   Insufficient validation of the parameters passed to pack() can
   lead to a heap overflow which can be used to execute arbitrary
   code from within a PHP script. This enables an attacker to
   bypass safe_mode restrictions and execute arbitrary code with
   the permissions of the webserver. Due to the nature of this
   function it is unlikely that a script accidently exposes it to
   remote attackers.

   [02 - unpack() - integer overflow leading to heap info leak ]

   Insufficient validation of the parameters passed to unpack() can
   lead to a heap information leak which can be used to retrieve
   secret data from the apache process. Additionally a skilled
   local attacker could use this vulnerability in combination with
   01 to bypass heap canary protection systems. Similiar to 01 this
   function is usually not used on user supplied data within
   webapplications.

   [03 - safe_mode_exec_dir bypass in multithreaded PHP ]

   When safe_mode is activated within PHP, it is only allowed to
   execute commands within the configured safe_mode_exec_dir.
   Unfourtunately PHP does prepend a "cd [currentdir] ;" to any
   executed command when a PHP is running on a multithreaded unix
   webserver (f.e. some installations of Apache2). Because the name
   of the current directory is prepended directly a local attacker
   may bypass safe_mode_exec_dir restrictions by injecting shell-
   commands into the current directory name.

   [04 - safe_mode bypass through path truncation ]

   The safe_mode checks silently truncated the file path at MAXPATHLEN
   bytes before passing it to realpath(). In combination with certain
   malfunctional implementations of realpath() f.e. within glibc this
   allows crafting a filepath that pass the safe_mode check although
   it points to a file that should fail the safe_mode check.

   [05 - path truncation in realpath() ]

   PHP uses realpath() within several places to get the real path
   of files. Unfourtunately some implementations of realpath() silently
   truncate overlong filenames (f.e. OpenBSD, and older NetBSD/FreeBSD)
   This can lead to arbitrary file include vulnerabilities if something
   like "include "modules/$userinput/config.inc.php"; is used on such
   systems.

   [06 - unserialize() - wrong handling of negative references ]

   The variable unserializer could be fooled with negative references
   to add false zvalues to hashtables. When those hashtables get
   destroyed this can lead to efree()s of arbitrary memory addresses
   which can result in arbitrary code execution. (Unless Hardened-PHP's
   memory manager canaries are activated)

   [07 - unserialize() - wrong handling of references to freed data ]

   Additionally to bug 07 the previous version of the variable
   unserializer allowed setting references to already freed entries in
   the variable hash. A skilled attacker can exploit this to create
   an universal string that will pass execution to an arbitrary
   memory address when it is passed to unserialize(). For AMD64 systems
   a string was developed that directly passes execution to code
   contained in the string itself.

   It is necessary to understand that these strings can exploit a
   bunch of popular PHP applications remotely because they pass f.e.
   cookie content to unserialize().

   Examples of vulnerable scripts:

      - phpBB2
      - Invision Board
      - vBulletin
      - Woltlab Burning Board 2.x
      - Serendipity Weblog
      - phpAds(New)
      - ...

Proof of Concept:

   The Hardened-PHP project is not going to release exploits for any
   of these vulnerabilities to the public.

CVE Information:

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
   assigned the name CAN-2004-1018 to issues 01, 02, the name
   CAN-2004-1019 to issues 06, 07, the name CAN-2004-1063 to issue 03
   and the name CAN-2004-1064 to issues 04, 05.

Recommendation:

   It is strongly recommended to upgrade to the new PHP-Releases as
   soon as possible, because a lot of PHP applications expose the
   easy to exploit unserialize() vulnerability to remote attackers.
   Additionally we always recommend to run PHP with the Hardened-PHP
   patch applied.

An update that fixes 5 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
php5 was updated to fix five security issues.
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2015-0231: Use-after-free vulnerability in the process\_nested\_data
function in ext/standard/var\_unserializer.re in PHP before 5.4.37, 5.5.x
before 5.5.21, and 5.6.x before 5.6.5 allowed remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via a crafted unserialize call that leverages
improper handling of duplicate numerical keys within the serialized
properties of an object. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2014-8142 (bnc#910659).
- CVE-2015-0232: The exif\_process\_unicode function in ext/exif/exif.c in
PHP before 5.4.37, 5.5.x before 5.5.21, and 5.6.x before 5.6.5 allowed
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
(uninitialized pointer free and application crash) via crafted EXIF data
in a JPEG image (bnc#914690).
- CVE-2014-8142: Use-after-free vulnerability in the process\_nested\_data
function in ext/standard/var\_unserializer.re in PHP before 5.4.36, 5.5.x
before 5.5.20, and 5.6.x before 5.6.4 allowed remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via a crafted unserialize call that leverages
improper handling of duplicate keys within the serialized properties of
an object, a different vulnerability than CVE-2004-1019 (bnc#910659).
- CVE-2014-9427: sapi/cgi/cgi\_main.c in the CGI component in PHP through
5.4.36, 5.5.x through 5.5.20, and 5.6.x through 5.6.4, when mmap was
used to read a .php file, did not properly consider the mapping's length
during processing of an invalid file that begins with a # character and
lacks a newline character, which caused an out-of-bounds read and might
(1) allowed remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from
php-cgi process memory by leveraging the ability to upload a .php file
or (2) trigger unexpected code execution if a valid PHP script is
present in memory locations adjacent to the mapping (bnc#911664).
For openSUSE 13.2 this additional security issue was fixed:
- CVE-2014-9426: The apprentice\_load function in libmagic/apprentice.c in
the Fileinfo component in PHP through 5.6.4 attempted to perform a free
operation on a stack-based character array, which allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or application
crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors
(bnc#911663).
Patch Instructions:

# PHP 4.3.10 Release Announcement

[ [Version Française](/releases/4_3_10_fr.php) ]

PHP Development Team would like to announce the immediate release of [PHP 4.3.10](/downloads.php). This is a
maintenance release that in addition to over 30 non-critical bug fixes addresses several very
serious security issues.

These include the following:

[CAN-2004-1018](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1018) - shmop\_write() out of bounds memory write access.

[CAN-2004-1018](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1018) - integer overflow/underflow in pack() and unpack() functions.

[CAN-2004-1019](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1019) - possible information disclosure, double free and negative reference index array underflow in deserialization code.

[CAN-2004-1020](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1020) - addslashes() not escaping \0 correctly.

[CAN-2004-1063](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1063) - safe\_mode execution directory bypass.

[CAN-2004-1064](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1064) - arbitrary file access through path truncation.

[CAN-2004-1065](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1065) - exif\_read\_data() overflow on long sectionname.

magic\_quotes\_gpc could lead to one level directory traversal with file uploads.

All Users of PHP are strongly encouraged to upgrade to this release as soon as possible.

## Bugfix release

Aside from the above mentioned issues this release includes the following important fixes:

* Possible crash inside ftp\_get().
* get\_current\_user() crashes on Windows.
* Possible crash in ctype\_digit() on large numbers.
* Crash when parsing *?getvariable[][*.
* Possible crash in the curl\_getinfo() function.
* Double free when openssl\_csr\_new fails.
* Crash when using unknown/unsupported session.save\_handler and/or session.serialize\_handler.
* Prevent infinite recursion in url redirection.
* Ensure that temporary files created by GD are removed.
* Crash in fgetcsv() with negative length.
* Improved performance of the foreach() construct.
* Improved number handling on non-English locales.

An update that fixes four vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
php5 was updated to fix four security issues.
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2015-0231: Use-after-free vulnerability in the process\_nested\_data
function in ext/standard/var\_unserializer.re in PHP before 5.4.37, 5.5.x
before 5.5.21, and 5.6.x before 5.6.5 allowed remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via a crafted unserialize call that leverages
improper handling of duplicate numerical keys within the serialized
properties of an object. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2014-8142 (bnc#910659).
- CVE-2014-9427: sapi/cgi/cgi\_main.c in the CGI component in PHP through
5.4.36, 5.5.x through 5.5.20, and 5.6.x through 5.6.4, when mmap is used
to read a .php file, did not properly consider the mapping's length
during processing of an invalid file that begins with a # character and
lacks a newline character, which caused an out-of-bounds read and might
(1) allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from php-cgi
process memory by leveraging the ability to upload a .php file or (2)
trigger unexpected code execution if a valid PHP script is present in
memory locations adjacent to the mapping (bnc#911664).
- CVE-2015-0232: The exif\_process\_unicode function in ext/exif/exif.c in
PHP before 5.4.37, 5.5.x before 5.5.21, and 5.6.x before 5.6.5 allowed
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
(uninitialized pointer free and application crash) via crafted EXIF data
in a JPEG image (bnc#914690).
- CVE-2014-8142: Use-after-free vulnerability in the process\_nested\_data
function in ext/standard/var\_unserializer.re in PHP before 5.4.36, 5.5.x
before 5.5.20, and 5.6.x before 5.6.4 allowed remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via a crafted unserialize call that leverages
improper handling of duplicate keys within the serialized properties of
an object, a different vulnerability than CVE-2004-1019 (bnc#910659).
Additionally a fix was included that protects against a possible NULL
pointer use (bnc#910659).
This non-security issue was fixed:
- php53 ignored default\_socket\_timeout on outgoing SSL connection
(bnc#907519).
Patch Instructions:

# Hardened PHP

PHP is far and away the most popular backend programming
language today, with more than 80 websites worldwide taking advantage of PHP
solutions.

All of the most popular CMS platforms – including WordPress,
Joomla!, and Drupal (just to name a few) leverage this technology. It’s
flexibility and versatility make it a powerhouse programming language, but that
doesn’t necessarily mean that it is as secure as it could or should be “right
out of the box”, so to speak.

It’s popularity, it’s widespread adaptation, and its
relatively easy to learn structure has made PHP a major target for cyber
criminals and hackers to exploit. This is why it’s mission-critical that you
harden your PHP files server-side as much as possible, protecting your server,
your content, and your visitors from these kinds of dangerous exploits.

PHP can be hardened manually as well as with patching
protocols. Below we highlight the steps you’ll want to take to make sure that
your PHP installation is as locked down as possible.

**Locate the PHP Config File You’re Hardening on Your Server**

The very first step in hardening your PHP installation is
first finding the PHP configuration file on your server to begin with.

Depending on the hosting that you are taking advantage of
(the actual provider as well as the type of hosting you have selected) it can
be in a variety of different locations. The best way to quickly locate this
critical file is to simply do a server-side search for “PHP.ini” as this is the
actual file that you’ll want to modify, edit, and harden moving forward.

**Editing the File on Shared Hosting**

Individuals looking to harden their PHP on a shared hosting platform (see [The Blog Starter](https://www.theblogstarter.com/) for hosting options) will have a bit of a tougher hill to climb, if only because most providers do not offer root access to the server with this level of hosting.

You’ll have to contact your hosting provider directly to see
if you can edit the main PHP.ini file itself. In the event that you aren’t
allowed this kind of access, you can still request to have access to the
“.HTaccess” file on your server to make the changes you need to.

You won’t be able to make changes quite as quickly this way
as you would have been able to with a patch (like we highlight below), but you
can manually make individual line edits to your PHP settings this way to enjoy
a higher level of security.

Shared hosting may still have limitations on the PHP elements you can edit no matter how much access you are granted. If you want total control over hardening your PHP (and total control over the security of your web platform), it’s not a bad idea to move to Dedicated or VPS servers if you can afford it.

**Editing the File on Dedicated/VPS servers**

If you are moving forward with a Virtual Private Server
(VPS) or Dedicated server set up the process for hardening your PHP is a lot
easier, though it’s still not as quick as applying a server wide patch like we
highlight below.

In the backend administration toolset of your server
solution you’ll find a tool called the Web Host Manager. This is usually
located under the “Service Configuration” settings option in your backend
dashboard.

This tool is going to allow you to select the PHP
Configuration Editor, and editor that allows you to make changes to your
PHP.ini file through a more user-friendly interface than actually downloading
the file, opening it up in Notepad or a similar application, and then making
the edits individually with the actual source code itself.

There are a handful of individual settings that you’re going
to want to reconfigure manually when taking this approach to hardening your PHP
installation, including (but not limited to):

•           Remote
Connections

•           Run Time
Settings

•           Input Data
Restrictions

•           Error
Handling

•           Restrict
File Access

•           File
Uploads

•           Session
Security

•           Soap Cache

… And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

**Use a Patch like Suhosin to Harden PHP Almost Instantly**

The big attraction behind PHP is that it is so easy to learn,
so easy to develop with, and about as flexible as a programming language gets –
and that’s why a lot of people feel comfortable hardening their PHP manually,
running line by line through their PHP.ini file and doing the heavy lifting of
securing their system on their own.

And while you may be a top-tier programmer and feel
completely confident in your coding prowess, the truth of the matter is that if
you allow ANY coding from ANY outside developers to run on your server you’ll
still have vulnerabilities that you may not be able to address independently –
vulnerabilities that can compromise your entire platform.

This is why patching your PHP systemwide is such a savvy
move, and why so many developers, programmers, and website/web application
owners utilizing PHP decide to move forward with a solution like Suhosin.

Engineered specifically to provide an advanced layer of
protection to PHP installations, the Suhosin patch is a dual action component
that provides a level of hardening that may not be possible through any other
manual approach.

On the one hand, Suhosin works to patch the PHP core on your
server. This allows this patch to protect against issues like format string
vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, and other issues that may plague your as of
yet unsecured PHP installation.

On the other hand, Suhosin also acts as an extension to the
PHP that has already been installed on your server. This extension runs 24/7,
around-the-clock, to protect against all kinds of vulnerabilities (including
runtime vulnerabilities) as well as individual session issues while adding a
whole host of logging, filtering, and administrative tools at the same time.

Best of all, the installation of this PHP hardening patch is
about as simple and as straightforward as it gets.

All of the features it has to offer exist within its
extension module and “flipping the switch” to allow that extension to run is as
easy as activating the individual extension inside of the PHP.ini file.
Sometimes you’ll have to manually add a couple of extra Configuration
Directives to trigger the full suite of extension capabilities, but most of the
time the Suhosin patch works just as soon as the edits to the PHP.ini file go
live.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
