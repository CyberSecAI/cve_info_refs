{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The variable unserializer in PHP could be fooled with negative references to add false zvalues to hashtables. When those hashtables get destroyed, this can lead to efree() calls on arbitrary memory addresses.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of negative references in the unserialize() function.",
      "Use-after-free vulnerability due to incorrect handling of references to freed data."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. A skilled attacker can exploit this to create a universal string that will pass execution to an arbitrary memory address when it is passed to unserialize().",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation by passing crafted serialized data to the unserialize() function.",
     "Local exploitation with negative references to trigger arbitrary memory writes"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to provide malicious serialized data to a PHP application using the unserialize() function, which is commonly accessible through HTTP cookies or user input.",
	  "additional_notes": "Many popular PHP applications like phpBB2, Invision Board, vBulletin, Woltlab Burning Board 2.x, Serendipity Weblog, phpAds(New) are vulnerable to this attack. A string was developed for AMD64 systems which directly passes execution to code contained within the string itself."
