Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2004-1564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is insecure coding practices in the w-agora forum software, which leads to multiple vulnerabilities including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and HTTP Response Splitting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The `redir_url.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `key` parameter.
    *   **Technical Detail:** `redir_url.php?bn=demos_links&key=[SQL]` allows a malicious user to inject SQL queries.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Vulnerability 1:** The `download_thread.php` script is vulnerable to XSS via the `thread` parameter.
        *   **Technical Detail:** `download_thread.php?site=support&bn=support_install&thread=[XSS code here]` allows injecting arbitrary JavaScript code.
    *   **Vulnerability 2:** The `login.php` script is vulnerable to XSS via the `loginuser` parameter.
        *  **Technical Detail:** A POST request to `/login.php` with `loginform=1&redirect_url=1&loginuser=[XSS code here]&loginpassword=1` can execute injected Javascript.
    *   **Vulnerability 3:** The `forgot_password.php` script is vulnerable to XSS via the `userid` parameter.
        *   **Technical Detail:** A POST request to `/forgot_password.php` with `go=1&userid=[XSS code here]` can execute injected Javascript.

3.  **HTTP Response Splitting:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The `subscribe_thread.php` is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting via the `thread` parameter.
    *   **Technical Detail:**  `/subscribe_thread.php?site=support&bn=support_in
    stall&thread=%0d%0aContent-Length:%200%0d%0a%0d%0a%20200%20OK%0d%0aConte
    nt-Type:%20text/html%0d%0aContent-Length:%2034%0d%0a%0d%0a%3chtml%3eScan
    ned%20by%20PTsecurity%3c/html%3e%0d%0a`
    allows an attacker to inject arbitrary headers and content into the HTTP response.

4.  **Path Disclosure**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The `list.php` script discloses path information via the `collapse` parameter.
    *   **Technical Detail:** `/list.php?bn=support_install&last=19&collapse=|id|` discloses path information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** A remote user can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service.
*   **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that can steal user cookies (including authentication cookies), redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the website.
*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** Allows an attacker to manipulate the HTTP response, possibly leading to cache poisoning, cross-site scripting, or other attacks.
*  **Path Disclosure:** Can reveal sensitive information about the server's directory structure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Sending a crafted GET request to `redir_url.php` with malicious SQL code in the `key` parameter.
*   **XSS:** Sending crafted GET requests to `download_thread.php` with malicious Javascript in the `thread` parameter, sending crafted POST requests to `login.php` or `forgot_password.php` with malicious Javascript in the respective parameters.
*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** Sending a crafted GET request to `subscribe_thread.php` with special characters to inject headers and content.
*   **Path Disclosure:** Sending a crafted GET request to `list.php` with specific parameters that will disclose server path information

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable w-agora forum server.
*   No prior authentication is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by Positive Technologies using MaxPatrol.
*   The vulnerabilities were fixed in CVS versions of `subscribe_thread.php3`, `forgot_password.php3`, `include/auth.php`, and `list.php3`.
