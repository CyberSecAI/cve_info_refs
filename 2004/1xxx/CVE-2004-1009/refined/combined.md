Package        : mc
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-1004 CAN-2004-1005 CAN-2004-1009 CAN-2004-1090 CAN-2004-1091
                 CAN-2004-1092 CAN-2004-1093 CAN-2004-1174 CAN-2004-1175 CAN-2004-1176

Andrew V. Samoilov has noticed that several bugfixes which were
applied to the source by upstream developers of mc, the midnight
commander, a file browser and manager, were not backported to the
current version of mc that Debian ships in their stable release.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:

CAN-2004-1004

    Multiple format string vulnerabilities

CAN-2004-1005

    Multiple buffer overflows

CAN-2004-1009

    One infinite loop vulnerability

CAN-2004-1090

    Denial of service via  corrupted section header

CAN-2004-1091

    Denial of service via null dereference

CAN-2004-1092

    Freeing unallocated memory

CAN-2004-1093

    Denial of service via use of already freed memory

CAN-2004-1174

    Denial of service via manipulating non-existing file handles

CAN-2004-1175

    Unintended program execution via insecure filename quoting

CAN-2004-1176

    Denial of service via a buffer underflow

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.5.55-1.2woody5

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems should already be
fixed since they were backported from current versions.

We recommend that you upgrade your mc package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
