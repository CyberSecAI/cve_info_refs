- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper filtering of user-supplied input in the name form of TypePad. The filtering script fails to properly handle double quotes (") when preceded by a question mark (?).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the inadequate input sanitization of the 'name' parameter, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript within the `<a href>` tag. The vulnerability stems from the failure to properly filter double quotes (") when preceded by a question mark (?), allowing for the premature closing of the `<a>` tag and enabling the injection of arbitrary HTML attributes, such as event handlers (e.g., onmouseover).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page. When a user interacts with the crafted link (e.g., by hovering over it), the injected script is executed, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other client-side attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a maliciously crafted URL that is passed to the 'name' variable. This crafted URL exploits the vulnerability in the filtering script and injects JavaScript code into the web page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL with a specific payload, including a question mark followed by a double quote, and the malicious javascript code. The attacker does not need any other special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
