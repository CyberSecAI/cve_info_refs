{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the calculation of the chunk size during processing of PNM network streams. The code does not properly handle the 'max' variable which represents the maximum remaining buffer size.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Integer overflow",
    "Buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a buffer overflow by sending a specially crafted stream of data, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network connection using the PNM protocol.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to send a specially crafted PNM stream to the vulnerable application."
