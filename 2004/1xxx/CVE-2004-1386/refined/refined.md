Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a lack of input validation on uploaded images within the Wiki edit page of TikiWiki. Specifically, there was no check to ensure that uploaded files were indeed images (e.g., GIF, PNG, JPEG).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary weakness was the ability to upload arbitrary files, including PHP scripts, through the image upload functionality in the Wiki edit page.
*   **Lack of File Type Validation:**  The software failed to validate the file extension of the uploaded file against an allowlist of safe extensions, making it possible to upload executable file types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By uploading a malicious PHP script, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the TikiWiki instance. This could lead to complete compromise of the server and the data it hosts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any user who has permission to upload images in the TikiWiki's wiki edit functionality.
*   **Upload via Wiki Edit Page:** The attacker uploads a malicious PHP script disguised as an image through the regular image upload feature on the wiki edit page.
*   **Direct access** Once the php file is uploaded it is accessible directly via the web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Account:** The attacker must have a user account on the TikiWiki installation.
*   **Image Upload Permissions:** The attacker needs sufficient privileges to be able to upload images in the wiki pages.

**Additional details:**

* The provided documents mention that the vulnerability exists in all versions of TikiWiki prior to the patch, making it critical to update vulnerable installations.
* The vulnerability is described as being "trivial, stupid, and obvious".
* The advisory provides a detailed explanation and multiple ways to fix or mitigate the issue:
    *   Upgrade to the patched version (1.7.9, 1.8.4.1, 1.9rc3.1)
    *   Apply a one line patch to tiki-editpage.php
    *   Disable the "Pictures" feature in the wiki admin panel.
    *   Configure the webserver (.htaccess for Apache or server configuration) to not process php files within the upload directory.
*   The advisory also provides guidance to check logs for attempts to exploit the vulnerability.

This information is consistent with the CVE description of arbitrary command execution, and provides additional details on the attack vector, mitigation steps, and impact.
