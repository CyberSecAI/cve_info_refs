# TikiWiki: Arbitrary command execution — GLSA **200501-12**

A bug in TikiWiki allows certain users to upload and execute malicious PHP
scripts.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/tikiwiki** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.8.4.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.8.4.1** |

### Background

TikiWiki is a web-based groupware and content management system (CMS),
using PHP, ADOdb and Smarty.

### Description

TikiWiki lacks a check on uploaded images in the Wiki edit page.

### Impact

A malicious user could run arbitrary commands on the server by
uploading and calling a PHP script.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All TikiWiki users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/tikiwiki-1.8.4.1"
```

Note: Users with the vhosts USE flag set should manually use
webapp-config to finalize the update.

To all tikiwiki administrators and developers, here is an important announcement concerning security of existing Tikiwiki websites, in all versions. If you manage a Tikiwiki, you should read this article attentively, it contains all details about how to fix the problem in a one line change in one file.

# Christmas Security Alert : php injection

---

## The security flaw

There was no check on the uploaded images in the wiki edit page. Then a malicious user with permission to upload image could upload any php script and call it directly in the tikiwiki file tree, from img/wiki\_up/ directory. Actually the flaw is quite trivial, stupid, and obvious. It's rather amazing that nobody fixed it before.

---

## The security cure

Repair your tiki without delay !

### Check your tikiwiki sanity

Search for files with extensions .php, .php3, .php4 or .phtml in your img/wiki\_up (or img/wiki\_up/$tikidomain/ in case of multitiki). You can use the following onelines to find them out (works with multitikis too)

Copy to clipboard
```
  find img/wiki_up -type f -name "*.php"
  find img/wiki_up -type f -name "*.php3"
  find img/wiki_up -type f -name "*.php4"
  find img/wiki_up -type f -name "*.phtml"
```
### Check your apache logs

To find out if someone used that flaw to inject unwanted php file, you can grep your logs (if you can use grep).

Copy to clipboard
```
  grep 'img/wiki_up/[^"]*.ph\(p\(3\|4\)\?\|tml\) ' var/log/apache/yourtiki.access.log
```

or if your logs are rotated and if you can use zgrep

Copy to clipboard
```
  zgrep 'img/wiki_up/[^"]*.ph\(p\(3\|4\)\?\|tml\) ' var/log/apache/yourtiki.access.log*
```
### Apply a fix

The fastest emergency fix is to disable the "Pictures" feature in the wiki admin panel (/tiki-admin.php?page=wiki).

The alternative inhibition of pictures upload on wiki pages is to limit the feature by setting the tiki\_p\_upload\_picture permission in the groups admin panel.

But for a real fix, and to still be able to include pictures on wiki pages, you need to upgrade or patch the tiki-editpage.php file :

* CVS users :

   Just update your version, the fix is in all branches from 1.7 to 1.10

   Copy to clipboard
  ```
  cvs -q update -dP
  ```

* Other users :

   Add the following line in tiki-editpage.php

   Copy to clipboard
  ```
    if (preg_match('/\.(gif|png|jpe?g)$/i',$picname))
  ```

   just before the line containing

   Copy to clipboard
  ```
    move_uploaded_file( ...
  ```
  + with version 1.7.x, on line 106
  + with version 1.8.x, on line 138
  + with version 1.9rcx, on line 173 and 181
  + with version 1.10, on line 172

### The sysadmin way

Alternatively (or in more) to the file upgrade/patch, you can inhibit the parsing of php files in the img/ dir.

* If you use apache, but don't have access to the configuration file, create a .htaccess in img/wiki\_up/ containing

   Copy to clipboard
  ```
    <FilesMatch "\.ph(p(3|4)?|tml)$">
      order deny,allow
      deny from all
    </FilesMatch>
  ```

   if it doesn't work, ask your admin to activate the .htaccess power with

   Copy to clipboard
  ```
    AllowOverride Limit
  ```

   in the Directory directive of your tikiwiki tree. Note that if you use a multi-tiki setup, you'll need to add that .htaccess in each img/wiki\_up/$tikidomain subdirectory.

* If you can change your apache conf because you admin it, add

   Copy to clipboard
  ```
    <Directory /var/www/tiki/img>
      <FilesMatch "\.ph(p(3|4)?|tml)$">
        order deny,allow
        deny from all
      </FilesMatch>
    </Directory>
  ```

   where you need to adapt the path for the directory to match with where is located your img/ dir.

   Both methods above just block the access to php files in img/ directory, but you may also want to inhibit .pl, .vb and other extensions if your global configuration enables those extensions to be parsed by another preprocessor.

---

## New releases with a fix

In each released branch a new version is available, namely 1.7.9, 1.8.4.1 and 1.9rc3.1. If you didn't apply one of the solutions listed above :

**you should upgrade as soon as possible**.

Remember that you always can alert the tikiwiki security group by sending a mail to security at tikiwiki.org.
