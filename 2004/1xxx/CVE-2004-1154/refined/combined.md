## Samba vulnerable to integer overflow processing file security descriptors

#### Vulnerability Note VU#226184

Original Release Date: 2004-12-17 | Last Revised: 2005-01-05

---

### Overview

Samba contains an integer overflow vulnerability in code that processes file security descriptors. This could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Samba is an open-source implementation of SMB/CIFS file and print services. It is frequently included in UNIX and Linux distributions and is typically used provide file and print services to Windows clients.  The Samba daemon, smbd, contains a vulnerability in code that processes file security descriptors. While allocating heap memory to store security descriptors, a 32-bit integer counter may overflow (wrap). This counter is truncated and used by smbd to allocate memory to store security descriptors. Without checking the size of this value, smbd may allocate insufficient memory, resulting in a buffer overflow. Heap memory control structures can be overwritten, corrupting heap memory, and possibly allowing the execution of arbitrary code. More information is available in iDEFENSE Security Advisory [12.16.04](http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=165).An authenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted SMB packet. Note that an attacker may be authenticated to an anonymous share, in which case the attacker would not require valid credentials, just a TCP connection. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An authenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system. The smbd daemon typically runs with root privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Patch or upgrade**Apply a patch or upgrade as specified by your vendor. This vulnerability is addressed in Samba [3.0.10](http://www.samba.org/samba/news/#3.0.10) and a [patch](http://us2.samba.org/samba/ftp/patches/security/samba-3.0.9-CAN-2004-1154.patch) (with [signature](http://us2.samba.org/samba/ftp/patches/security/samba-3.0.9-CAN-2004-1154.patch.asc)) is available for Samba 3.0.9. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**The [Samba Server Security](http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/server_security.html) web page documents several ways to restrict access to Samba servers based on network interface, IP network, and TCP ports (139 and 445). Also, consider disabling or carefully restricting access to anonymous shares. |

Debian Security Advisory DSA 701-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
March 31st, 2005                        <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : samba
Vulnerability  : integer overflows
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-1154
CERT advisory  : VU#226184

Greg MacManus discovered an integer overflow in the smb daemon from
Samba, a LanManager like file and printer server for GNU/Linux and
Unix-like systems.  Requesting a very large number of access control
descriptors from the server could exploit the integer overflow, which
may result in a buffer overflow which could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code with root privileges.  Upstream developers have
discovered more possible integer overflows that are fixed with this
update as well.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.3a-14.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.10-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
