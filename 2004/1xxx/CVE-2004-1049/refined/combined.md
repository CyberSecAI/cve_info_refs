## Microsoft Windows LoadImage API vulnerable to integer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#625856

Original Release Date: 2005-01-06 | Last Revised: 2005-01-12

---

### Overview

The Microsoft Windows [LoadImage API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/resources/introductiontoresources/resourcereference/resourcefunctions/loadimage.asp) routine is vulnerable to an integer overflow that may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The [LoadImage API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/resources/introductiontoresources/resourcereference/resourcefunctions/loadimage.asp) routine is used to load an image from a file on Microsoft Windows platforms. The LoadImage API is included part of the USER 32 library. A lack of input validation on user supplied input to the LoadImage API routine may allow an integer overflow to occur. If a remote attacker supplies a specially crafted image file to a vulnerable system, that attacker may be able to trigger the integer overflow to compromise that system.  According to public reports, many Microsoft Windows are affected. However, reports also indicate Windows XP with Service Pack 2 is not vulnerable, but we have not confirmed this.Note that exploits for this vulnerability are publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| If a remote attacker can persuade a user to access a specially crafted image file, the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on that user's system, possibly with elevated privileges. Potentially any operation that displays an image could trigger exploitation; for instance, browsing the file system, reading HTML email, or browsing websites. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**  Apply a patch as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-002](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-002.mspx). Please also note that Microsoft is actively deploying the patches for this vulnerability via [Windows Update](http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/). |

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA will determine if this update is required. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**Note** After April 20, 2004, the Mssecure.xml file that is used by MBSA 1.1.1 and earlier versions is no longer being updated with new security bulletin data. Therefore, scans that are performed after that date with MBSA 1.1.1 or earlier will be incomplete. All users should upgrade to MBSA 1.2 because it provides more accurate security update detection and supports additional products. Users can download MBSA 1.2 from the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about MBSA support, visit the following Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer 1.2 Q&A; Web site.

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine if this update is required?**
Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

The Security Update Inventory Tool is required for detecting Microsoft Windows and other affected Microsoft products. For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460).

## Vulnerability Details

#### Cursor and Icon Format Handling Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1049:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that cursor, animated cursor, and icon formats are handled. An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious cursor or icon file that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site or viewed a malicious e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Cursor and Icon Format Handling Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1049:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also attempt to compromise a Web site to have it serve up a Web page with malicious content attempting to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or a site compromised by the attacker.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

  The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

  + Apply the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-040](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=19873) or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
  + Use Internet Explorer 6 or later.
  + Use the Microsoft Outlook E-mail Security Update, use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or later, or use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or later in its default configuration.
* Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 is not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Cursor and Icon Format Handling Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1049:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Install the** [**Outlook E-mail Security Update**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) **if you are using Outlook 2000 SP1 or earlier.**

  By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002 and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) has been installed.

  Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed. Customers who use any of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.
* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or later, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or later, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or later and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about enabling this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ for Cursor and Icon Format Handling Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1049:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full privileges. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative privileges.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability exists due to insufficient format validation prior to rendering cursors, animated cursors, and icons.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted web page. An attacker could also create a specially-crafted email message and send it to an affected system. Upon viewing web page, preview or reading a malicious message, the attacker could cause the affected system to execute code. Additionally, an attacker could add a specially crafted image to the local file system or onto a network share and then persuade the user to preview the directory by using Windows Explorer.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers are only at risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative credentials are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that cursors, animated cursor, and icon formats are validated prior to rendering.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CAN-2004-1049.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had seen examples of proof of concept code published publicly but had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Does applying this security update help protect customers from the code that has been published publicly that attempts to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. This security update addresses the vulnerability for which proof of concept code has been published publicly. The vulnerability that has been addressed has been assigned the Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CAN-2004-1049.

#### Windows Kernel Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1305:

A denial of service vulnerability exists in the way that cursor, animated cursor, and icon formats are handled. An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious cursor or icon file that could potentially cause the operating system to become unresponsive. The operating system would have to be restarted to restore functionality.

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Kernel Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1305:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also attempt to compromise a Web site to have it serve up a Web page with malicious content attempting to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or a site compromised by the attacker.
* By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

  The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

  + Apply the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-040](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=19873) or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
  + Use Internet Explorer 6 or later.
  + Use the Microsoft Outlook E-mail Security Update, use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or later, or use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or later in its default configuration.
* Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 is not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Windows Kernel Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1305:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Install the** [**Outlook E-mail Security Update**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) **if you are using Outlook 2000 SP1 or earlier.**

  By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002 and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) has been installed.

  Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed. Customers who use any of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.
* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or later, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or later, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or later and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about enabling this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ for Windows Kernel Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1305:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a denial of service vulnerability. An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding and automatically restart. During that time, the operating system cannot respond to requests. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow attackers to execute code or elevate their privileges, but it could cause the affected system to stop responding. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability exists due to insufficient format validation prior to rendering cursors, animated cursors, and icons.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted web page. An attacker could also create a specially-crafted email message and send it to an affected system. Upon viewing web page, preview or reading a malicious message, the attacker could cause the affected system to stop responding

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers are only at risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative credentials are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that cursors, animated cursor, and icon formats are validated prior to rendering.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CAN-2004-1305.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had seen examples of proof of concept code published publicly but had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Does applying this security update help protect customers from the code that has been published publicly that attempts to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. This security update addresses the vulnerability for which proof of concept code has been published publicly. The vulnerability that has been addressed has been assigned the Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CAN-2004-1305.

**Verifying Update Installation**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. This tool allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

  **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.

  1. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

  **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB891711\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 891711 security update into the Windows installation source files.

I.DESCRIPTION:
-------------

An exploitable integer buffer overflow exists in the LoadImage API of the USER32 Lib. \
This function loads an icon, a cursor or a bitmap and then try to proceed the image. \
If an attacker sends a specially crafter bmp, cur, ico or ani file within an HTML \
page or in an Email, it is then possible to run arbitrary code on the affected \
system.
II.DETAILS:
----------

When the LoadImage API try to proceed the image, it directly uses the size field in \
the image  file and then add 4. So if we set the size of image between \
0xfffffffc-0xffffffff, an integer buffer overflow occurs.

The function defines:

HANDLE LoadImage(
  HINSTANCE hinst,   // handle of the instance containing the image
  LPCTSTR lpszName,  // name or identifier of the image
  UINT uType,        // type of image
  int cxDesired,     // desired width
  int cyDesired,     // desired height
  UINT fuLoad        // load flags
);

lpszName is the handle to the image to load, uType specifies the type of image to be \
loaded.  This parameter can be one of the following values:
 IMAGE_BITMAP Loads a bitmap.
 IMAGE_CURSOR Loads a cursor.
 IMAGE_ICON Loads an icon.

When LoadImage API try to parse the bmp,cur,ico,ani file format, it doesn't implement \
any check on the size field and add 4. Look at the code below:

    When use ANI or CUR:
       .text:77D56178                 mov     eax, [ebx+8]                   //Direct \
                read our size here:P
 .text:77D5617B                 mov     [ebp+dwResSize], eax
 .text:77D5617E                 jnz     short loc_77D56184
 .text:77D56180                 add     [ebp+dwResSize], 4             //add 4 int \
                overflow...
 .text:77D56184
 .text:77D56184 loc_77D56184:                           ; CODE XREF: \
                sub_77D5608F+EFj
 .text:77D56184                 push    [ebp+dwResSize]                 //allocate a \
                wrong size
 .text:77D56187                 push    0
 .text:77D56189                 push    dword_77D5F1A0
 .text:77D5618F                 call    ds:RtlAllocateHeap

      Then use the fake size for memmov and lead the heap overflow:
       .text:77D561A9                 mov     ecx, [ebx+8]
 .text:77D561AC                 mov     esi, [ebx+0Ch]
 .text:77D561AF                 add     esi, [ebp+arg_0]
 .text:77D561B2                 mov     edx, ecx
 .text:77D561B4                 shr     ecx, 2
 .text:77D561B7                 mov     edi, eax
 .text:77D561B9                 rep movsd
 .text:77D561BB                 mov     ecx, edx
 .text:77D561BD                 and     ecx, 3
 .text:77D561C0                 rep movsb
