- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The game automatically exits when it receives a network packet larger than the maximum supported size (usually 512 bytes). The game interprets the "Message too long" socket error as a critical condition, leading to termination.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The game lacks proper error handling for oversized network packets, leading to a forced exit.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious server can remotely crash any client by sending an oversized packet, preventing players from participating in online games. This constitutes a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attack via network, sending oversized UDP packets to the vulnerable server/client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to control or have access to a server capable of sending UDP packets. They can be a malicious server or any other entity able to send crafted packets.
