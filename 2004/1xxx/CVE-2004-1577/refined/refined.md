- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `index.php` file of PHP Links. Specifically, the script attempts to include a file specified in the `show` parameter of the URL. When a non-existent file is provided (e.g., `juax0rx.php`), PHP generates a warning message.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a full path disclosure. The PHP error message reveals the full server path to the application's directory (e.g., `/home/h4x0rsit3/b0x/phplinks/`). Additionally, there is a lack of proper error handling which exposes the path.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain the full path of the web application on the server. This information can be used to assist in further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a web request, specifically by crafting a URL with a non-existent filename as the value for the `show` parameter (e.g., `http://server/phplinks/index.php?show=juax0rx`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required.
