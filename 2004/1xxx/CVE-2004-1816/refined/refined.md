Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how SOAP servers handle array parameters in web service requests. Specifically, processing a maliciously crafted SOAP request containing an array of objects causes a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the server.
*   **Weakness:** The SOAP server implementation lacks proper validation or resource management when parsing and processing array parameters within SOAP requests. This allows a small, regular-sized request to trigger excessive resource consumption or processing on the server side, leading to a DoS.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service. The server becomes unavailable to legitimate users, disrupting services provided by the vulnerable SOAP server.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack is executed by sending a specifically crafted SOAP request to a vulnerable web service endpoint. This request includes an array of objects that cause the server to overconsume resources when parsing or processing the request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker only needs the ability to send SOAP requests to the targeted server. No specific access, credentials or prior knowledge about internal infrastructure are mentioned beyond the structure of the vulnerable web service's API.

**Affected Products (as listed in the advisory):**

*   Macromedia ColdFusion/MX 6.0 and 6.1
*   Macromedia ColdFusion/MX 6.0 and 6.1 J2EE (all editions)
*   Macromedia JRun 4.0 (all editions)
*   Sun Java System Application Server 7 Update 2 Upgrade and earlier (formerly Sun ONE Application Server). Note that versions prior to 7.0 are not affected.
*   "and probably other SOAP servers" - indicating a wider scope of potential vulnerability across different SOAP server implementations.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory suggests that a regular-sized, malicious SOAP request is sufficient to trigger the DoS.
*   Patches and solutions were available through links provided by the vendors.
