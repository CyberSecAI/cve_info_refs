How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

=       Winamp 5.05 (only version tested)
=
= Public disclosure on November 23, 2004
========================================================================

== Overview ==

In this time of responsible vulnerability disclosure, it's a little
disturbing when a vendor acts on disclosed information but gives no
recognition or even notification that an update has been created due to
the information passed to them.

This advisory is a little late, the update was posted to the vendor
website last week. The only reason I know this, is because I asked and
received a response.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

hi brett

the problem was fixed in the lastest [sic] release of winamp.
version 5.06 went live on the site last thurday [sic].

thanks

jonathan ward

------------------------------------------------------------------------

But enough of that, we know the game and still choose to play.

We discovered a remotely exploitable stack based buffer overflow in
winamp version 5.05. It is possible that earlier versions are also
vulnerable and we recommend all users to upgrade to the latest version.

The overflow can be caused in various ways, the most dangerous though is
through a malformed .m3u playlist file. When hosted on a web site, these
files will automatically downloaded and open in winamp without any user
interaction. This is enough to cause the overflow that would allow a
malicious playlist to overwrite EIP and execute arbitrary code.

== Exploitation ==

When winamp opens the malformed playlist file, a first exception will
occur:

First Chance Exception in winamp.exe (IN_CDDA.DLL) : Access Violation
At this location
00A49BE8 88 4C 04 30          mov         byte ptr [esp+eax+30h],cl

This exception will be handled by winamp, and execution will then
continue until it reaches the second exception at this location
61616161   ???

with the registers looking like;
EAX = 0012A5D8 EBX = 0012C024
ECX = 61616161 EDX = 77F96DAE
ESI = 0012A600 EDI = 0046B9E0
EIP = 61616161 ESP = 0012A540
EBP = 0012A560 EFL = 00210246

As can be seen, EIP has been overwritten with a value supplied through
the malformed playlist file, 0x61616161 (aaaa) and since more playlist
supplied data is located at the address pointed to by EDI, execution of
malicious code is possible.

== Solutions ==

- Install the vendor supplied patch.

It appears that the 'patched' version 5.05 does NOT fix the buffer overflow
issue that we notified Nullsoft about. This is obviously not good.

As we wrote in our advisory we were notified by email that the issue had
been fixed and an update posted to the website.

We have sent Nullsoft a copy of this email, and hope that they can remedy
this problem quickly. Unfortunately, this may not be the case as was
pointed out to me by somebody.

== Solutions ==

- Disassociate .cda and .m3u extensions from winamp
- Wait for an update

========================================================================

== Overview ==

In this time of responsible vulnerability disclosure, it's a little
disturbing when a vendor acts on disclosed information but gives no
recognition or even notification that an update has been created due to
the information passed to them.

This advisory is a little late, the update was posted to the vendor
website last week. The only reason I know this, is because I asked and
received a response.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

hi brett

the problem was fixed in the lastest [sic] release of winamp.
version 5.06 went live on the site last thurday [sic].

thanks

jonathan ward

------------------------------------------------------------------------

But enough of that, we know the game and still choose to play.

We discovered a remotely exploitable stack based buffer overflow in
winamp version 5.05. It is possible that earlier versions are also
vulnerable and we recommend all users to upgrade to the latest version.

The overflow can be caused in various ways, the most dangerous though is
through a malformed .m3u playlist file. When hosted on a web site, these
files will automatically downloaded and open in winamp without any user
interaction. This is enough to cause the overflow that would allow a
malicious playlist to overwrite EIP and execute arbitrary code.

== Exploitation ==

When winamp opens the malformed playlist file, a first exception will
occur:

First Chance Exception in winamp.exe (IN_CDDA.DLL) : Access Violation
At this location
00A49BE8 88 4C 04 30          mov         byte ptr [esp+eax+30h],cl

This exception will be handled by winamp, and execution will then
continue until it reaches the second exception at this location
61616161   ???

with the registers looking like;
EAX = 0012A5D8 EBX = 0012C024
ECX = 61616161 EDX = 77F96DAE
ESI = 0012A600 EDI = 0046B9E0
EIP = 61616161 ESP = 0012A540
EBP = 0012A560 EFL = 00210246

As can be seen, EIP has been overwritten with a value supplied through
the malformed playlist file, 0x61616161 (aaaa) and since more playlist
supplied data is located at the address pointed to by EDI, execution of
malicious code is possible.

== Solutions ==

- Install the vendor supplied patch.

## WinAmp playlist handling may allow a remote buffer overflow and arbitrary code execution

#### Vulnerability Note VU#986504

Original Release Date: 2005-02-21 | Last Revised: 2005-02-21

---

### Overview

WinAmp contains a flaw which may allow a remote system compromise if a maliciously crafted playlist is loaded.

### Description

| Nullsoft's WinAmp is a multimedia system for Microsoft Windows. WinAmp allows users to create and use "playlists" to play their multimedia files in a customized order.  WinAmp versions previous to 5.08c contain a flaw in playlist handling code which may allow arbitrary code to be executed. In addition, WinAmp playlists may be loaded from remote locations on the Internet without user intervention, so this flaw may be exploited by a remote user.This WinAmp flaw exposes a stack-based buffer overflow, which allows remote execution of arbitrary code. A playlist which contains a long device name or file number for some types of files (including .cda) may overflow the handler code in the IN\_CDDA.dll plug-in and execute arbitrary code.Also, the default configuration of Internet Explorer and WinAmp will open remote .pls and .m3u playlist files without prompting the user. Other web browsers (due to user settings or defaults) may also open these types of files automatically. As such, a standard HTML document can embed a playlist file to automatically load when the user follows a normal link to this malicious page. This creates a condition where it is possible to exploit the flaw by simply loading an innocuous-looking web page. |
| --- |

### Impact

| WinAmp may encounter a stack-based buffer overflow condition which would allow remote arbitrary code execution under the privileges of the user running WinAmp. This could lead to total system compromise and control by a malicious attacker. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This flaw has been corrected in WinAmp version 5.08c and later. Download and install the latest version from:<<http://www.winamp.com/player/>> |
| --- |

| Note: This flaw has been re-discovered in a series of the latest WinAmp releases. Should the flaw re-occur again, a recommended course of action until an update is developed is:Do not open unknown .cda, .pls or .m3u files.Do not open .cda, .pls or .m3u files automatically with WinAmp in your web browser.Of course, these recommendations always apply to any unknown files and file types. It is also always advised for all users to ensure their browser settings prompt for the desired action (Save, Cancel, Open) with all file types that may load remote data, such as WinAmp .pls or .m3u playlist file types. |
