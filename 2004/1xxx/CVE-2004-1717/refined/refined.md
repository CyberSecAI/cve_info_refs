The provided content describes multiple stack and heap buffer overflows in the `psscan()` function of the `gv` postscript viewer, specifically related to how `sscanf()` is used to parse postscript files.

**Root Cause:** The `psscan()` function uses `sscanf()` with format strings that include `%s` without proper bounds checking, leading to buffer overflows when parsing specific PostScript header fields (`%%BoundingBox:`, `%%Orientation:`, `%%PageOrder:`, `%%Pages:`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack buffer overflows occur due to the unbounded use of `%s` in `sscanf()` when parsing PostScript headers. There are at least 5 different locations where this occurs.
- Heap overflows are also present, in at least 2 places, although specific details are not provided in this content except to suggest `grep -n sscanf`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution by overwriting the return address on the stack. The provided exploit demonstrates this using shellcode.
- Potential for denial-of-service, though the primary focus is on code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted PostScript files.
- Exploitable header fields include `%%BoundingBox:`, `%%Orientation:`, `%%PageOrder:`, `%%Pages:` (and likely others based on `grep -n sscanf`)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create and supply a malicious postscript file that would be opened by a vulnerable version of `gv`.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable program, specifically how the vulnerable `sscanf` calls in `ps.c` are used when handling certain PostScript headers, as well as the offsets necessary to overwrite the return address.

The provided exploit code creates a malicious PostScript file, where the following occurs:
1. A NOP sled is generated
2. The return address is overwritten with the desired address to hijack program execution
3. Shellcode is placed after the return address in the buffer
4. A simple socket shell is launched on port 7000, once the crafted postscript file is processed

The content provides significantly more detail about the vulnerability than a basic CVE description. It highlights multiple locations of the vulnerability within the `psscan()` function and provides a working exploit, with source code.
