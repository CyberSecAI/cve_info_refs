# Sudoedit can expose file contents

Sep 15, 2004

A flaw in exists in sudoâ€™s -e option (aka sudoedit) in sudo version
1.6.8 that can give an attacker read permission to a file that would
otherwise be unreadable.

## Sudo versions affected:

1.6.8 only

## Details:

While sudoedit runs the actual editor as the invoking user, the
temporary file is then re-opened with root privileges. An attacker
can run sudoedit, remove the editor temporary file, make a link to
an unreadable file with the same name as the old temporary file
and quit the editor. The file being edited via sudoedit will now
contain a copy of the previously unreadable file.

## Impact:

Exploitation of the bug requires that the sudoers file be configured
to allow the attacker to run sudoedit. If no users have been granted
access to sudoedit there is no impact.

## Fix:

The bug is fixed in sudo 1.6.8p1.

## Credit:

This problem was brought to my attention by Reznic Valery.

Subject: [sudo-announce] Sudo version 1.6.8p1 now available

Sudo version 1.6.8, patchlevel 1 is now available.  It includes a
fix for a security flaw in sudoedit that could give a malicious
user read access to file that would normally be unreadable.  See
<http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/alerts/sudoedit.html> for more details.

Major changes since Sudo 1.6.8:

 o Sudoedit now re-opens the temp file as the invoking user
   and will only open regular files.

 o Better detection of unchanged files in sudoedit.

 o The path to ldap.conf is now configurable.

 o Added SSL tls_* certificate checking options when using LDAP.

 o The sample pam config file has been updated.

Commercial support is now available for Sudo.  If your organization
uses Sudo please consider purchasing a support contract to help
fund additional Sudo development at <http://www.sudo.ws/support.html>
Custom enhancements to Sudo may also be contracted for.

You can also help out by "purchasing" a copy of Sudo or making a
donation at <http://www.sudo.ws/purchase.html>

Sudo is still free software and I intend for it to remain so but
as I currently lack regular employment I am asking for help from
the Sudo community.  Your support will enable me to continue to
improve Sudo and complete projects such as a proper user's manual
and a major rewrite of large portions of Sudo.

You may recall news of a patent recently awarded to MicroSoft that
some people have said covers Sudo.  After reading through the patent
and conferring with several people I don't believe it covers Sudo
as it exists now since the patent appears to cover a persistent
daemon process.  However, the patent does seem overly broad and
could restrict future Sudo development so I am collecting prior
art in the hopes of having the patent re-evaluated.  If you have
examples of prior art, please contact me with details.

## sudoedit can expose protected file contents

#### Vulnerability Note VU#424358

Original Release Date: 2004-10-19 | Last Revised: 2004-10-27

---

### Overview

Sudo's -e option (sudoedit) improperly handles temporary files, allowing an attacker to read files that would otherwise be inaccessible.

### Description

| [Sudo](http://sudo.ws/) is a utility that allows specific users to run certain commands as root. Beginning with version 1.6.8, sudo provides safe editing functionality via sudoedit. Sudoedit allows specific users to edit certain files as root, as specified by the [sudoers](http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/man/sudoers.html) configuration file.  When sudoedit launches the specified editor, it reopens a temporary copy of the file to be edited with root privileges. If this temporary file is changed to be a symlink to a file with restricted access, the editor will display the contents of the file with restricted access. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An authenticated user who has the permissions to run sudoedit may be able to read protected files. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from your vendor**For vendor-specific information regarding vulnerable status and patch availability, please see the vendor section of this document.**Upgrade your version of sudo**Upgrade your system as specified by your vendor. If you need to upgrade sudo manually, get [sudo 1.6.8p1](http://sudo.ws/sudo/download.html). Note that only sudo 1.6.8 contains this vulnerability. Previous versions are not affected. |
| --- |

| **Disable sudoedit**This vulnerability is only exploitable if a user has explicitly been granted sudoedit permissions. If the sudoers configuration file does not grant permission to run sudoedit, then the vulnerability cannot be exploited. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
