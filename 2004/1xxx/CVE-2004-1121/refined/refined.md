{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from how web browsers interpret HTML, specifically the combination of ANCHOR and TABLE elements. When these elements are arranged in a specific way, the browser displays one URL in the status bar (anchor1) while actually accessing a different URL (anchor2) when the link is clicked.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The core vulnerability is a URL spoofing issue. The status bar, which is typically used to indicate the destination of a link, is misleading. This discrepancy between the displayed URL and the actual destination URL can be used to trick users into visiting malicious websites.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to conduct phishing attacks, redirecting users to malicious websites disguised as legitimate ones. This can lead to the theft of sensitive information such as credit card numbers, account numbers, and passwords. Social engineering can further amplify the impact.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting a web page with a specific combination of HTML ANCHOR and TABLE elements. The attacker would embed malicious links within the 'anchor2' part of the vulnerable code. By convincing the user to interact with the link (e.g. clicking the link on the page), the malicious link is accessed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious web page containing the vulnerable HTML structure. The attacker also has to be able to deliver this malicious web page to the target (e.g., through email, compromised website, etc.) and convince the victim to interact with the deceptive link."
