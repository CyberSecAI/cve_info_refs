# mtink: Insecure tempfile handling — GLSA **200411-17**

mtink is vulnerable to symlink attacks, potentially allowing a local user
to overwrite arbitrary files with the rights of the user running the
utility.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-print/mtink** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.5** |

### Background

mtink is a status monitor and inkjet cartridge changer for some Epson
printers.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy from Gentoo Linux discovered that mtink uses insecure
permissions on temporary files.

### Impact

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary files
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
mtink is executed, this would result in the file being overwritten with
the rights of the user running the utility, which could be the root
user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All mtink users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-print/mtink-1.0.5"
```
### References

* [CVE-2004-1110](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2004-1110)

**Release date**

November 09, 2004

**Latest revision**

May 22, 2006: 02

**Severity**

normal

**Exploitable**

local

| [Description](#c0)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-06 16:09:46 UTC  ``` just noticed mtinkd puts it's runtime data in it's own subdirectory of /var and /var/run, but look at this...            if ( access("/var/run/mtink", O_RDONLY) == -1 )           {              um = umask(0);              if ( mkdir("/var/run/mtink", 0777) == -1 )              {                 perror("mkdir ");                 if ( debug )                 {                    fprintf(stderr,"can't create directory /var/run/mtink\n");                 }                 exit(1);              }              umask(um);           }  I don't see why he's so keen to have 0777, but anyway, that could be forgivable with some safe tmp file handling...            if ( (fp = fopen(runFile, "w")) )           {               fprintf(fp,"%d\n", getpid());               fclose(fp);           }  examples....  create a file anywhere ----------------------  $ pwd /var/run/mtink $ ln -s /etc/nologin epson $ file epson  epson: broken symbolic link to `/etc/nologin' <wait for root to start mtinkd> $ file epson  epson: symbolic link to `/etc/nologin'  overwrite any file ------------------  $ pwd /var/run/mtink $ ln -s /etc/passwd epson ...  There's probably a local root in there somewhere, and it looks like you might be able to get it to kill any process on stop, but I havnt tried. the name of the run file and fifo is the NAME variable in /etc/conf.d/mtinkd.  I think the perms on the run directory should be a lot stricter, eg 0700. I don't think /var/mtink needs 777 either, perhaps 755 would be better. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-07 03:09:40 UTC  ``` Upstream notified. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-07 03:47:31 UTC  ``` Upstream will fix and release a new version in a few days. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-07 07:30:56 UTC  ``` Upstream released 1.0.5 to fix the issue:  <http://xwtools.automatix.de/files/mtink-1.0.5.tar.gz>  Printing please bump. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Heinrich Wendel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-08 03:01:59 UTC  ``` bumped to 1.0.5 and marked stable on x86 ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-08 03:15:11 UTC  ``` Thx Heinrich.  Security please draft. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-08 03:56:47 UTC  ``` I think the ebuild should chmod /var/run/mtink and /var/mtink in pkg_postinst() to fix the perms for users who are upgrading, just adding "chmod 700 /var/mtink /var/run/mtink 2>/dev/null" should be enough. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Heinrich Wendel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-08 04:09:39 UTC  ``` good idea, added that ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-09 12:01:43 UTC  ``` GLSA 200411-17 ``` |  |
