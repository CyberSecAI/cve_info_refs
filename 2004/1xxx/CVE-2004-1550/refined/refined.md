Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in the Motorola Wireless Router WR850G:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Authentication Circumvention:** The router's firmware does not correctly track the currently logged-in system. This allows an attacker to hijack an active session when the legitimate administrator logs in.
*   **Password Recovery:** The router's web server exposes a page (`/ver.asp`) that contains sensitive configuration information, including the web interface username and password, WEP keys, SNMP community string, and DDNS passwords.
*   **Easter Egg:** A hidden page (`/frame_debug.asp`) provides a web shell that allows any user with access to the web interface to execute arbitrary commands on the router's underlying Linux system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** The router's web interface fails to properly manage sessions, allowing an attacker to gain access by exploiting concurrent login attempts.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `/ver.asp` page exposes sensitive information in clear text.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The `/frame_debug.asp` page grants unauthenticated users a root shell.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Router Control:** By circumventing authentication, an attacker can gain full administrative access to the router's web interface. This allows for configuration changes, network manipulation, and other malicious activities.
*   **Credential Theft:** Exposure of the username and password through `/ver.asp` allows persistent unauthorized access.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary commands through the web shell results in complete control of the router's embedded Linux system. This could be used for network attacks, malware deployment, or data theft.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack requires network access to the router, either from the local network or from the internet if the web interface is exposed to the WAN.
*   **Web Interface Access:** The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP requests to the router's web interface on port 8080.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the router.
*   **Concurrent Access:** For the authentication bypass, the attacker must make requests while a legitimate user is logging into the web interface.
*   **No Authentication Required (Initially):** The attacker does not initially need valid credentials for the authentication bypass or to access the `ver.asp` or `frame_debug.asp` pages after a successful bypass.
