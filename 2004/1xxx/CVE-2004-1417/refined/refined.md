```
- Root cause of vulnerability: User supplied input is not properly checked. Specifically, the login parameter in login.php is vulnerable.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could steal cookie-based authentication credentials or execute arbitrary code within a victim's browser.
- Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious URL with a JavaScript payload in the login parameter and tricking a user into visiting it.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload and trick a user into visiting this malicious URL.
