       "vulnerability": "A locally exploitable flaw has been found in the Linux socket layer, that allows a local user to hang a vulnerable machine.\nThe socket layer uses several logical sublayers. One of the layers, so called auxiliary message layer (or scm layer), augments the socket API by an universal user-kernel message passing capability. One of the scm message parsing functions invoked from the kernel sendmsg() code is __scm_send() and suffers from a deadlock condition if carefully prepared auxiliary message(s) is sent to a socket by an unprivileged application.\nWe believe that the 2.4 kernel branch is not further exploitable. The 2.6 branch has not been extensively checked, however it may be locally exploitable to gain elevated privileges due to its increased complexity.",
