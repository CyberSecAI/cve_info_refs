**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Ipswitch WS_FTP Server handles the `REST` command in conjunction with file uploads (`STOR`). The server doesn't properly account for the space allocation implied by the `REST` command when checking against user-upload quotas. The `REST` command allows the user to arbitrarily set a file offset, which can be far beyond the current end-of-file, effectively creating "sparse" files. WS_FTP Server doesn't consider the "empty" space created by `REST` when calculating used disk space against user quotas.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Quota Enforcement:** WS_FTP Server fails to accurately track disk space usage when the `REST` command is used before a `STOR` command. It does not consider the "phantom" space created by the offset in the `REST` command.
*   **Unbounded File Growth:** By manipulating the file offset with `REST`, an attacker can create arbitrarily large files (limited by the maximum file size of the operating system and disk space). Although the actual file data uploaded might be small, the server will pre-allocate the space based on the offset, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A user can easily exhaust all available disk space on a partition where they have write access. This can lead to system instability, unavailability of the FTP server, and potentially other applications relying on disk space.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The server's resources (disk space) are depleted quickly, making the service unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **FTP Protocol:** The attack is carried out using standard FTP commands: `REST` and `STOR`.
*   **Remote Network Access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through an FTP connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **FTP Account with Write Access:** The attacker needs a valid FTP account on the vulnerable WS_FTP Server with write permissions to at least one directory.
*   **Ability to Send FTP Commands:** The attacker needs to be able to send FTP commands, including `REST` and `STOR`, to the server.
*   **Basic Knowledge of FTP:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how the `REST` command and file upload process work in FTP.
