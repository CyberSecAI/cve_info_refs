## Opera Browser for computers

### Browser for Windows

We’ve been developing desktop browsers since the mid 90’s. Opera Browser is our main product and the first to receive the major updates that we later roll out to other browsers. Opera Browser for Windows combines safety, privacy & speed.

### Browser for macOS

Opera Browser for macOS is no different than Opera Browser for Windows. It's also a desktop browser that maximizes your privacy, content enjoyment, and productivity. In our browsers for computers, you can use a wide range of add-ons to personalize your browser.

### Browser for Linux

Just like the browsers for Windows and macOS, the browser for Linux is a desktop browser and works on the same principles. In these browsers, you can also use Chrome extensions for even better personalization of your Opera browser.

### Browser for Chromebook

## Opera Browser for mobile

### Browser for Android

Desktop and mobile devices are vastly different, and we created Opera for Android devices capturing the spirit of desktop browsers as accurately as possible. It’s your perfect online companion that protects your privacy and personal information.

### Browser for iOS

Opera Browser for iOS provides intuitive one-handed navigation with the Fast Action Button and bottom search bar. Its maximized screen space lets you search the web with ease and comfort. Built-in Ad Blocker, free VPN, Aria browser AI, and other features make browsing the web faster and safer. [Explore more about Opera for iOS](/ios).

## You deserve a better browser

Opera's free VPN, Ad blocker, and Flow file sharing. Just a few of the must-have features built into Opera for faster, smoother and distraction-free browsing designed to improve your online experience.

### Browser for macOS

Opera Browser for macOS is no different than Opera Browser for Windows. It's also a desktop browser that maximizes your privacy, content enjoyment, and productivity. In our browsers for computers, you can use a wide range of add-ons to personalize your browser.

### Browser for Linux

Just like the browsers for Windows and macOS, the browser for Linux is a desktop browser and works on the same principles. In these browsers, you can also use Chrome extensions for even better personalization of your Opera browser.

# Opera: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200502-17**

Opera is vulnerable to several vulnerabilities which could result in
information disclosure and facilitate execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/opera** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **7.54-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **7.54-r3** |

### Background

Opera is a multi-platform web browser.

### Description

Opera contains several vulnerabilities:

* fails to properly validate Content-Type and filename.
* fails to properly validate date: URIs.
* uses kfmclient exec as the Default Application to handle downloaded
  files when integrated with KDE.
* fails to properly control frames.
* uses Sun Java packages insecurely.
* searches an insecure path for plugins.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to:

* execute arbitrary code.
* load a malicious frame in the context of another browser
  session.
* leak information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Opera users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/opera-7.54-r3"
```
