- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the Content-Type field of an email header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability. The software fails to properly handle an abnormally long string in the Content-Type field of an email header.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. By overwriting the EIP via SEH, an attacker can execute malicious code on the vulnerable system.
- **Attack vectors:** Receiving a specially crafted email from a POP3 server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to send a malformed email via POP3 to the vulnerable Gaucho application.
