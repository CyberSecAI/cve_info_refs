## Archive::Zip may not properly parse the file sizes of Zip archives

#### Vulnerability Note VU#492545

Original Release Date: 2004-11-12 | Last Revised: 2004-11-15

---

### Overview

Archive::Zip does not properly parse Zip files and may incorrectly interpret malformed zip archives to contain zero length/size files. As a a result, anti-virus software using Archive::Zip may fail to detect malicious content within a Zip archive.

### Description

| The Archive::Zip module allows PERL programs to manipulate Zip archives. An attacker may be able to create a specially crafted Zip archive that could cause Archive::Zip to interpret files in the archive as having zero length. If anti-virus software is using Archive::Zip to scan Zip attachments, it may fail to detect the malicious content and allow the archive into the system. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to craft a malicious Zip archive that will evade detection by anti-virus software using Archive::Zip. Once in the system, if the remote attacker can persuade the user to accesses the malicious archive, the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on that user's system, possibly with administrator privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade Archive::Zip**  This issue has been addressed in [Archive::Zip version 1.4](http://search.cpan.org/~nedkonz/Archive-Zip/). |

# Archive::Zip: Virus detection evasion — GLSA **200410-31**

Email virus scanning software relying on Archive::Zip can be fooled into
thinking a ZIP attachment is empty while it contains a virus, allowing
detection evasion.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-perl/Archive-Zip** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.14** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.14** |

### Background

Archive::Zip is a Perl module containing functions to handle ZIP
archives.

### Description

Archive::Zip can be used by email scanning software (like amavisd-new)
to uncompress attachments before virus scanning. By modifying the
uncompressed size of archived files in the global header of the ZIP
file, it is possible to fool Archive::Zip into thinking some files
inside the archive have zero length.

### Impact

An attacker could send a carefully crafted ZIP archive containing a
virus file and evade detection on some email virus-scanning software
relying on Archive::Zip for decompression.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Archive::Zip users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-perl/Archive-Zip-1.14"
```
