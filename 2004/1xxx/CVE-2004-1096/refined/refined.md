  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2004-1096": {
      "details": "The Archive::Zip module allows PERL programs to manipulate Zip archives. An attacker may be able to create a specially crafted Zip archive that could cause Archive::Zip to interpret files in the archive as having zero length. If anti-virus software is using Archive::Zip to scan Zip attachments, it may fail to detect the malicious content and allow the archive into the system.",
      "root_cause": "Improper parsing of file sizes within Zip archives, specifically related to the uncompressed size field in the global header of the ZIP file.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect interpretation of file sizes in ZIP archives.",
        "Failure to validate the uncompressed size of files."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker may be able to craft a malicious Zip archive that will evade detection by anti-virus software using Archive::Zip. Once in the system, if the remote attacker can persuade the user to accesses the malicious archive, the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on that user's system, possibly with administrator privileges.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafting a malicious ZIP archive with manipulated uncompressed size fields in the global header.",
        "Sending the malicious ZIP archive as an email attachment."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to create a specially crafted ZIP archive.",
          "Ability to send the crafted ZIP archive to a target system (e.g., via email)."
      ],
        "additional_information": "This issue allows to bypass antivirus security since affected software fails to detect malicious files within a crafted archive. Software such as amavisd-new was affected."
