The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in ASP-rider, a Farsi weblog software. This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the login authentication.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `verify.asp` file located in the `blogadmin` folder of the ASP-rider weblog. The script is susceptible to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The `username` and potentially `password` parameters in `verify.asp` are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Bypassing authentication: An attacker can log in to the weblog administrator page without knowing the correct credentials by injecting a crafted SQL query.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attacker crafts a URL with malicious SQL code in the `username` and `password` parameters of the `verify.asp` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable weblog, they do not need prior access.
- The attacker needs knowledge of SQL and the structure of the database to formulate the malicious SQL query.
