**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The ParaChat Server 5.5 fails to properly handle the sequence "..%5C/", which is equivalent to "..\\/". This allows directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Directory Traversal: The server doesn't correctly sanitize or validate user-provided paths, allowing an attacker to navigate to directories outside the intended web root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP Requests: The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing the "../" sequence.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- Basic understanding of URL encoding to exploit the "..%5C/" vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by using the sequence "..%5C/" (URL-encoded backslash) within a URL.
- Example URL to test: `http://[host]:7877/..%5C/..%5C/`

**Additional Notes:**
