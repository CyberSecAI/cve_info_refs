{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Lack of HTML filtering in cPanel and WebHost Manager (WHM) allows for injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the cPanel interface, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, and other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET requests to specific cPanel URLs with malicious script payloads in the parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to entice a user to click on the malicious URL or inject it in a context where the cPanel user will be exposed to it."
