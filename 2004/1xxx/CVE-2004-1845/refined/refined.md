Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in News Manager Lite 2.5 and its administration interface, as described in the marc.info content:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in the output HTML, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML and scripts.
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient input validation and output encoding.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can inject client-side scripts to hijack user sessions, redirect users to malicious websites, or deface the website.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating the `email`, `search`, and `n` parameters in the following URLs:
        *   `http://[host]/comment_add.asp?ID=3&email=[XSS]`
        *   `http://[host]/search.asp?search=[XSS]`
        *   `http://[host]/category_news_headline.asp?ID=2&n=[XSS]`
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker only needs to craft malicious URLs with the XSS payload and make the user click them or include them in a malicious website.

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient input validation and lack of parameterized queries.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can manipulate SQL queries to extract sensitive data, modify information in the database, or potentially gain complete control over the database.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating the `ID` and `filter` parameters in the following URLs:
        *  `http://[host]/more.asp?ID='[SQL query]`
        *   `http://[host]/category_news.asp?ID='[SQL]`
        *   `http://[host]/news_sort.asp?filter='[SQL]`
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft malicious SQL queries.

*   **Cookie Account Hijacking:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application relies on a predictable format for authentication cookies, which is easily manipulated. The structure of the cookie allows the attacker to set the user as admin.
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure cookie management.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can gain administrative access to the application by manipulating the `NEWS%5FLOGIN` cookie.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Modifying the `NEWS%5FLOGIN` cookie to `ADMIN=1&ID=1`.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to modify browser cookies.

**Impact Summary:**

*   Disclosure of authentication information.
*   Disclosure of user information.
*   Execution of arbitrary code (XSS) on client browsers.
*   Modification of user and admin information via SQL injection and/or cookie manipulation.
*   User access via network using hijacked admin sessions.

**Affected Systems:**

*   Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows 2003, or Windows XP Professional/Server running News Manager Lite 2.5.
