# SUS: Local root vulnerability — GLSA **200409-17**

SUS contains a string format bug that could lead to local privilege
escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/sus** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.2-r1** |

### Background

SUS is a utility that allows regular users to be able to execute
certain commands as root.

### Description

Leon Juranic found a bug in the logging functionality of SUS that can
lead to local privilege escalation. A format string vulnerability
exists in the log() function due to an incorrect call to the syslog()
function.

### Impact

An attacker with local user privileges can potentially exploit this
vulnerability to gain root access.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All SUS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=app-admin/sus-2.0.2-r1"
 # emerge ">=app-admin/sus-2.0.2-r1"
```

Title			: SUS 2.0.2 local root vulnerability
Advisory ID		: LSS#2004-09-01
Date			: September 14th, 2004
Advisory URL:		: <http://security.lss.hr/index.php?page=details&ID=LSS-2004-09-01>

==[ Overview

SUS is a suid root program that allows ordinary users the execution of certain
programs with superuser privileges. SUS relatives are super, sudo and calife. SUS is
run by default as setuid root.

==[ Vulnerability

There is a very simple format string bug in log() function that allows any local
user to gain root privileges. Format string vulnerability is a result of an incorrect
syslog() function call, and can be exploited directly from the command line.

log.c:
--------

void
log(char * msg)
{
...
                openlog(ident, LOG_PID|LOG_CONS, facility);
                syslog(level,msg);                            // <- VULNERABILITY
...
}
--------

==[ Affected versions

The exploitation of this vulnerability was successfully tested on SUS version 2.0.2.

==[ Fix

GENTOO Linux has released a patched version - sus-2.0.2-r1.

There is also a fixed version on sus homepage:
<http://pdg.uow.edu.au/sus/sus-2.0.6.tar.Z>

==[ PoC Exploit

Proof of concept code can be downloaded at <http://security.lss.hr/PoC/>.

==[ Credits

This vulnerability was found by Leon Juranic (ljuranic@LSS.hr).
