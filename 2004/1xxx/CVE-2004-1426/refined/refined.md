Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `lng` parameter in `/install/index.php`. This parameter is used directly in an `include` statement without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files, including remote files if `allow_url_fopen` is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** The lack of input validation on the `$lng` parameter allows an attacker to control the included file path.
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** When `allow_url_fopen` is enabled in PHP, the attacker can specify a remote URL to include, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Null Byte Injection:** When magic_quotes_gpc is off, the attacker can terminate the filename with a null byte (`%00`). This can be used to bypass the .php extension restriction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the webserver user.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers can potentially include and execute scripts to access or manipulate sensitive data on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious GET request to `/install/index.php` with the `lng` parameter set to a malicious file path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Path:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable `index.php` file, typically `/install/index.php`.

**Specific Scenarios:**

*   **Scenario 1 (`magic_quotes_gpc = Off`):**
    *   The attacker can use null byte injection (`%00`) to include arbitrary local files, like `/etc/passwd`.
*   **Scenario 2 (`magic_quotes_gpc = On`):**
    *   The attacker can include local .php files to achieve code execution, for example, a file with `<?php phpinfo(); ?>`
*   **Scenario 3 (`allow_url_fopen = On`):**
    *   The attacker can include remote files, injecting malicious code from a server they control. They could also attempt to manipulate the `$G_PATH` variable to change include paths.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in KorWeblog versions 1.6.2-cvs and prior.
*   The vendor was contacted, but no official patch was released.
*   The provided patch restricts the $lng parameter to prevent directory traversal.
*   The exploit doesn't require `register_globals = On`, as the vulnerable code uses a direct `$lng` variable, rather than relying on global variables.
