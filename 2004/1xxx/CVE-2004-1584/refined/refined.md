Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2004-1584

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of input validation in the WordPress administration panel scripts, specifically in handling user-provided data, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- HTTP Response Splitting:  The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP response headers, leading to content spoofing and web cache poisoning.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows the injection of client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Multiple files in the WordPress administration panel were found to be vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Content Spoofing: Attackers can manipulate the content displayed on the website.
- Web Cache Poisoning: Attackers can poison web caches with malicious content, which can then be served to other users.
- Arbitrary Script Execution: Attackers can inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions on the victim's browser.
- Compromise of the victim's data or browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted URLs:  Attackers can create malicious URLs with injected code within parameters. For example, the `redirect_to`, `text`, `popupurl`, and `popuptitle` parameters in wp-login.php, or the parameters within admin-header.php, bookmarklet.php, categories.php, edit.php and edit-comments.php.
-  HTTP POST request to `/wp-login.php` with manipulated parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs or HTTP POST requests that contain injected code.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or access other than the ability to send a crafted request to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by both Thomas Waldegger (XSS) and "Chaotic Evil" (HTTP Response Splitting) independently.
- WordPress acknowledged the issues and released version 1.2.1 and then 1.2.2 to address these vulnerabilities.
- The initial report of the XSS issues also detailed multiple vulnerable admin panel files.
-  The HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by "Chaotic Evil" who contacted the vendor before public disclosure allowing for a timely fix.
-  The gentoo security team created a GLSA (Gentoo Linux Security Advisory) to inform users.

The provided content offers more detail than the basic CVE description by detailing the specific locations of the vulnerabilities (multiple admin files) and the exact method of exploiting the HTTP Response Splitting issue through a crafted POST request. It also mentions the involvement of multiple researchers in identifying the vulnerabilities and the coordinated effort for the fix.
