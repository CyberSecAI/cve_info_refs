The content is related to the CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The NetworkEverywhere router (Model NR041) does not filter DHCP HOSTNAME options received from clients.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Script injection via DHCP HOSTNAME option.
- Lack of input sanitization on DHCP hostname options.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious user can inject a web script into the web-based administrative interface.
- The injected script is executed within the administrator's session.
- This allows an attacker to reset the router's factory settings, including the administrator password.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted DHCP requests with malicious script embedded in the hostname option.
- The DHCP daemon is reachable from the internal network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same internal network as the vulnerable router.
- The attacker must have the ability to send DHCP requests.
- The attacker needs to know the IP address of the router.
- The attacker needs to be able to host an HTML file on a remote server that can be accessed by the router's web interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit uses an iframe injection to load a remote web page on a malicious server.
- The remote web page then contains a form that automatically submits a request to reset the router to factory defaults.
- The limited size of the DHCP hostname option makes the exploit challenging and requires multiple steps.
