## Macromedia JRun Server insecurely generates and handles JSESSIONIDs

#### Vulnerability Note VU#584958

Original Release Date: 2004-10-12 | Last Revised: 2004-10-12

---

### Overview

A vulnerability exists in Macromedia JRun that may allow an attacker to gain access to an authenticated user's session.

### Description

| Macromedia JRun is an application server that works with most popular web servers such as Apache and IIS. Macromedia [states](http://www.macromedia.com/software/jrun/productinfo/product_overview/pdf/jr4_product_overview.pdf) that JRun is deployed at over 10,000 organizations worldwide. The JSESSIONID is a string that uniquely identifies a user's session. JSESSIONIDs are generated using a limited character set (0-9) , therefore reducing the search space required for a brute-force attack. According to reports, JRun Server also handles the JSESSIONIDs insecurely potentially allowing an attacker to gain access to an authorized user's session. The insecure handling may involve how JSESSIONIDs are stored in web browser cookies or URLs. However, the specific details are not available at this time. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to hijack an authenticated user's session allowing the attacker to access sensitive information or execute commands on the server with the privileges of the compromised session. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**  In the latest updater increases the security of the JSESSIONID by expanding the character set used for JESSIONIDs to include letters as well as numbers.It is available for download at:<http://www.macromedia.com/support/jrun/updaters.html>. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Receiving Security Bulletins:

When Macromedia becomes aware of a security issue that we
believe significantly affects our products or customers,
we will notify customers when appropriate. Typically, this
notification will be in the form of a security bulletin
explaining the issue and the response. Macromedia customers
who would like to receive notification of new security
bulletins when they are released can sign up for our
security notification service.
