Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-1466:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way the Gallery application handles temporary files during the image upload process. Specifically, uploaded files are placed in a temporary directory and remain there for 30 seconds before being deleted if they aren't recognized as valid images.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Temporary File Handling:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that a temporary file remains for a brief period in a directory accessible by the web server.
- **Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Condition:** A carefully crafted script could be executed by a remote attacker during the 30-second window while the temporary file exists.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution as the user running the PHP process. This could allow an attacker to gain control of the server or access sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote, via HTTP requests. The attacker needs to upload a file to the Gallery server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have upload rights. This could be as an authenticated user or through "EVERYBODY" permissions on Gallery. Additionally, the temporary directory must be within the webroot for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200409-05) directly addresses CVE-2004-1466. It provides a detailed description of the vulnerability in Gallery, including the root cause, impact, and affected versions.
- Workarounds are suggested, including ensuring the temporary directory is outside the webroot, disabling upload rights, disabling debug mode, and disabling `allow_url_fopen` in `php.ini`.
- The advisory also provides resolution steps, directing users to upgrade to a version where the vulnerability is fixed.
- The bug report from gentoo.org (Bug 6) is not related to this CVE. It deals with the `ReportLab-1.11.ebuild`, which is a Python library for generating PDF files.
