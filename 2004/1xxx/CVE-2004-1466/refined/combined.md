# Gallery: Arbitrary command execution — GLSA **200409-05**

The Gallery image upload code contains a temporary file handling
vulnerability which could lead to execution of arbitrary commands.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/gallery** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.4\_p2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.4\_p2** |

### Background

Gallery is a PHP script for maintaining online photo albums.

### Description

The upload handling code in Gallery places uploaded files in a
temporary directory. After 30 seconds, these files are deleted if they
are not valid images. However, since the file exists for 30 seconds, a
carefully crafted script could be initiated by the remote attacker
during this 30 second timeout. Note that the temporary directory has to
be located inside the webroot and an attacker needs to have upload
rights either as an authenticated user or via "EVERYBODY".

### Impact

An attacker could run arbitrary code as the user running PHP.

### Workaround

There are several workarounds to this vulnerability:

* Make sure that your temporary directory is not contained in the
  webroot; by default it is located outside the webroot.
* Disable upload rights to all albums for "EVERYBODY"; upload is
  disabled by default.
* Disable debug and dev mode; these settings are disabled by
  default.
* Disable allow\_url\_fopen in php.ini.

### Resolution

All Gallery users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=www-apps/gallery-1.4.4_p2"
 # emerge ">=www-apps/gallery-1.4.4_p2"
```
