Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Kreed 1.05:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **A] In-game format string vulnerability:**
    *   **Root cause:** The server uses a format string in a vulnerable way when handling nicknames or messages. User-supplied input is directly used in a format string function without proper sanitization.
    *   **Weakness:** Format string vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server by sending format string specifiers like `%n`.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted nickname or message to the server.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the game server and send messages or set a nickname.

*   **B] Forced exit caused by "message too long":**
    *   **Root cause:** The server mishandles UDP packets exceeding a specific size (1401 bytes or more). This leads to a "message too long" socket error, causing the server to exit.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input validation and error handling for oversized UDP packets.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) as the server terminates unexpectedly.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending an oversized UDP packet to the server.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the game server.

*   **C] Server temporary freeze due to script errors:**
    *   **Root cause:** Errors in the server scripts that handle player information, specifically when a very long nickname or model type is used.
    *   **Weakness:** Server script errors are not handled properly, leading to application freezes.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) because the server becomes unresponsive until an admin dismisses the error dialog boxes.
    *   **Attack vector:** Using a very long nickname or model type when connecting to the server.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the game server.
