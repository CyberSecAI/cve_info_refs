The content is related to CVE-2004-1387.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure usage of temporary files in Apache scripts, specifically `fmn.sh` and `check_forensic`. These scripts were using the `$$` construct to create temporary file names in `/tmp`, which is predictable and susceptible to symlink attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Predictable temporary file names:** The use of `$$` (process ID) in temporary file names made them predictable.
- **Insecure temporary file creation:** The scripts did not use `mktemp` or similar secure methods to create temporary files.
- **Lack of cleanup:** Temporary files were not reliably removed, increasing the window of opportunity for an attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could monitor `/tmp` and create symlinks with predictable temporary file names before the Apache scripts use the temp files, leading to privilege escalation or other malicious actions.
- Specifically in the `check_forensic` script, an attacker could potentially redirect the script's actions to attacker controlled files.

**Attack vectors:**
- Monitoring the creation of temporary files in `/tmp` directory.
- Creating symlinks with predictable temporary file names before the vulnerable scripts use them.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to observe file creation in `/tmp` directory
- Ability to create symbolic links in `/tmp`
