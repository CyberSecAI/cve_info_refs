Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the security advisory:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause of this vulnerability is the presence of four default username/password pairs in the Sybase database backend used by ON Command CCM 5.x. One of these pairs was publicly disclosed, while two others were easily guessable. The fourth was hardcoded and used by server daemons.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Default Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the use of default, well-known credentials for database access.
-   **Hardcoded Credentials:** One of the default accounts uses credentials that are hardcoded into the applicationâ€™s binaries. This prevents administrators from changing that password.
-   **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** The CCM database stores sensitive information, including administrator passwords for managed systems, in clear-text.
-   **Network Accessibility:** The Sybase database server is by default reachable from the network via the standard Sybase database port.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Full System Compromise:** An attacker who gains access to the database using the default credentials can retrieve all passwords in clear text for all systems managed by CCM.
-   **Lateral Movement:** Because the database also stores the domain administrator password (if the system is joined to a domain), attackers can compromise both servers and workstations.
-   **Data Breach:** The CCM database stores other sensitive data including license keys, which are also exposed.
-   **Complete Control:** With access to administrative credentials, an attacker gains full control over managed systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers can gain access to the vulnerable database server through the network if the default Sybase database port is exposed.
- **Database Credentials:**  The attack relies on the presence of default username/password combinations within the Sybase database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the CCM server.
-   **Basic Database Knowledge:** The attacker needs some knowledge of how to connect to and query a Sybase database.
-   **No Privileged Access:** An attacker with no prior access to the system can gain full access through this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vendor, Symantec, was informed of the vulnerability and indicated that a fix would be available in the next release of CCM (version 6.0).
- Workarounds include changing the passwords for three of the accounts (though the fourth cannot be changed) and fire-walling the Sybase database port on the CCM server to prevent remote network access to the database.
- The information provided is more detailed than the typical CVE description, which often provides a basic summary of the vulnerability.
