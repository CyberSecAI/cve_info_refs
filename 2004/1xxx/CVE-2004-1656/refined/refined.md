- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the `redirecturl` parameter in `comersus_customerLoggedVerify.asp` not being properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject carriage return and line feed characters (%0d%0a) into the HTTP response headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability, which can lead to web cache poisoning and XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the HTTP response, potentially leading to:
  - Web Cache Poisoning: The attacker can inject a malicious HTTP response that gets cached, which will then be served to other users.
  - XSS: The injected response can contain malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a modified `redirecturl` parameter containing the necessary characters to inject custom HTTP headers and body.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges or access are required beyond that.
