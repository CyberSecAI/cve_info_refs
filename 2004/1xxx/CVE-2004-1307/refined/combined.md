## LibTIFF vulnerable to integer overflow in the TIFFFetchStrip() routine

#### Vulnerability Note VU#539110

Original Release Date: 2005-01-20 | Last Revised: 2005-08-23

---

### Overview

An integer overflow in LibTIFF may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| LibTIFF is a library used to encode and decode images in [Tag Image File Format (TIFF)](http://www.libtiff.org/). An integer overflow in the TIFFFetchStripThing() routine within the tif\_dirread.c file may allow an attacker to cause a heap-based buffer overflow. A lack of input validation on user-controlled data concerning the size of an TIFF image may allow a remote attacker to manipulate a call to malloc() to create a buffer with insufficient size. When data is copied to this under-sized buffer, a heap-based buffer overflow may occur.  Note that in order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must craft a TIFF image with the STRIPOFFSETS flag set.This vulnerability is believed to related to the integer overflows described in [VU#687568](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/687568). |
| --- |

### Impact

| If a remote attacker can persuade a user to access a specially crafted TIFF image, that attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of that user. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  This issue has been corrected in LibTIFF versions 3.7.0. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  **Do Not Accept TIFF Files from Unknown or Untrusted Sources**Exploitation occurs by accessing a specially crafted TIFF file (typically .tiff or .tif extension). By only accessing TIFF files from trusted or known sources, the chances of exploitation are reduced. |
