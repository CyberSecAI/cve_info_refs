The provided content is related to CVE-2004-1307.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the `TIFFFetchStripThing()` function within the `tif_dirread.c` file of LibTIFF. Specifically, a lack of input validation on user-controlled data related to TIFF image size allows an attacker to manipulate a call to `malloc()`, leading to an undersized buffer allocation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   Insufficient input validation on TIFF image size data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Remote code execution with the privileges of the user opening the crafted TIFF image.
*   Heap-based buffer overflow

**Attack vectors:**
*   Crafting a malicious TIFF image with the `STRIPOFFSETS` flag set.
*   Persuading a user to open or access the specially crafted TIFF image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Ability to craft a malicious TIFF image.
*   Ability to deliver the crafted TIFF image to a target user.
