- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in the `fcrontab` program that allows local users to view the contents of `fcron.allow` and `fcron.deny`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure due to insufficient access control on the `fcron.allow` and `fcron.deny` files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can view the contents of `fcron.allow` and `fcron.deny` files, potentially gaining knowledge of allowed/denied users or hosts. This could aid in further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system running Fcron.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
