{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The RSniff server does not close the socket file descriptor when a client fails authentication or closes the connection without sending data. This leads to a file descriptor leak.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "File descriptor leak",
       "Lack of proper resource management"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The server will eventually exhaust all available file descriptors, preventing it from accepting new connections.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network connections. An attacker can repeatedly connect to the server, send invalid data, or immediately close the connection."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to establish network connections to the RSniff server. No special privileges are required.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability is located in the `server.c` file of the RSniff application. The fix involves adding a `close(new_sockfd)` call in the authentication failure handling block."
