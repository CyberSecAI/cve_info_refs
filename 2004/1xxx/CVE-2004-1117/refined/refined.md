Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-1117:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure installation practices in the ebuilds (Gentoo's package build scripts) for GIMPS, SETI@home, and ChessBrain. Specifically, these ebuilds installed binaries owned by regular users (nobody:nogroup) and init scripts that would execute these binaries with root privileges. This misconfiguration allowed for local privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure File Ownership:** Binaries intended to be run with elevated privileges were not owned by root.
*   **Unsafe Execution of User-Owned Binaries:** Init scripts executed these user-owned binaries as root, creating a privilege escalation vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges on the affected system. By overwriting the user-owned binaries with malicious code, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with root privileges when the init script runs. This could lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the machine to modify the user-owned binaries.
*   **File System Modification:** The attacker overwrites vulnerable user-owned binaries with their own malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the system.
*   **Write Access to Vulnerable Binaries:** The attacker must have the ability to write to the vulnerable binaries' location which is normally only possible by local users.
*   **Timing:**  The attacker would need to replace the binary before it gets run by the init script

**Additional Details:**
*   The issue was discovered in app-sci/gimps, app-sci/setiathome, and app-sci/chessbrain packages.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by changing the ownership of binaries to root and adjusting the init scripts.
*   The fix involves updating the affected packages to versions `gimps-23.9-r1`, `setiathome-3.03-r2` and `chessbrain-20407-r1` or higher.
* The vulnerability could be exploited if the binaries were located on an NFS share, where they could be overwritten.
