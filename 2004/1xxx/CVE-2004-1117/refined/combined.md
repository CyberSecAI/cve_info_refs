# GIMPS, SETI@home, ChessBrain: Insecure installation — GLSA **200411-26**

Improper file ownership allows user-owned files to be run with root
privileges by init scripts.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sci-misc/gimps** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **23.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **23.9-r1** |

| Package | **sci-misc/setiathome** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **3.08-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.08-r4**revision >= **3.03-r2** |

| Package | **sci-misc/chessbrain** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **20407** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **20407-r1** |

### Background

GIMPS is a client for the distributed Great Internet Mersenne Prime
Search. SETI@home is the client for the Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence (SETI) project. ChessBrain is the client for the
distributed chess supercomputer.

### Description

GIMPS, SETI@home and ChessBrain ebuilds install user-owned binaries and
init scripts which are executed with root privileges.

### Impact

This could lead to a local privilege escalation or root compromise.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GIMPS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sci-misc/gimps-23.9-r1"
```

All SETI@home users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sci-misc/setiathome-3.03-r2"
```

All ChessBrain users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sci-misc/chessbrain-20407-r1"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Ulrich Müller   gentoo-dev  2004-11-02 12:09:53 UTC  ``` app-sci/gimps-23.9 installs /opt/gimps/mprime with ownership nobody:nogroup. In the default configuration, the initscript executes it as root user. If /opt is mounted via NFS, it might be possible to overwrite mprime by an arbitrary binary.  The same applies to the stable -23.5 version.  (Probably, it should be the other way around: the binary should be owned by root and run as a special user.) ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-02 13:00:28 UTC  ``` Hi Michal,  Please commit a fixed version. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-04 13:31:20 UTC  ``` sci please fix setiathome,chessbrain and any other applications with similar issues. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Michal Januszewski (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-04 14:39:59 UTC  ``` Gimps is now fixed. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-06 07:18:58 UTC  ``` sci please fix this ASAP. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Olivier Fisette (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-07 11:18:03 UTC  ``` Fixed for "app-sci/chessbrain".  "app-sci/foldingathome" is also affected. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-07 12:13:17 UTC  ``` Thanks Olivier.   sci please fix foldingathome also. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Olivier Fisette (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-07 12:20:09 UTC  ``` Fixed "app-sci/setiathome-3.08" (the version for x86 and amd64).  Could someone with access to either ppc, sparc, hppa or ia64 please do the same for version 3.03? This seems to be the last affected package.  "app-sci/foldingathome" is not affected. (That was my mistake.) ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-07 12:56:55 UTC  ``` Olivier just update the ebuilds and mark stable on the arches you have access to. Security will handle stable marking for other arches. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Olivier Fisette (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-07 13:32:01 UTC  ``` Fixed "app-sci/setiathome-3.03". All four supported arches are marked unstable. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-07 13:46:38 UTC  ``` Arches please mark setiathome stable. Fixed versions are 3.03-r2 and 3.08-r4.  Combined target keywords for setiathome:  x86 amd64 ppc sparc -alpha hppa ia64  ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Ferris McCormick (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-08 05:56:38 UTC  ``` sparc has following problems with setiathome-3.03-r2: 1) If you happen to have USE='X', installation fails because there is no xsetiathome; 2) If you do not have USE='X', the program installed at /opt/setiathome/setiathome is    not made executable:  You need to do 'chmod +x /opt/setiathome/setihome' by hand. (Previous 3.03-r1 ebuild takes care of this, but I do not know if the deletion was intentional or not. In any event, as it stands, what is installed for -r2 cannot be used but -r1 can be.) ======================== setiathome-3.08 is a nonstarter for sparc, since it does not actually exist.  Regards, Ferris ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-08 06:53:12 UTC  ``` Back to ebuild status.  Olivier please fix. ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Olivier Fisette (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-08 07:41:33 UTC  ``` Should be fixed in CVS, but I cannot test it. ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Ferris McCormick (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-08 08:21:45 UTC  ``` setiathome-3.03-r2 now installs and runs for sparc; sparc done. ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-08 11:19:29 UTC  ``` Back to stable marking. Thx Olivier. ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Jochen Maes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-09 01:23:28 UTC  ``` setiathome stable on ppc ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-13 00:00:27 UTC  ``` Thx Ferris. Please remember to remove arch from CC when you mark stable. ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Ferris McCormick (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-13 05:06:27 UTC  ``` Sorry.  It wasn't completely clear to me that setiathome was the only thing that needed looking at.  (Although I guess [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=69868#c7) gives a pretty good indication.) ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-14 10:36:06 UTC  ``` GLSA drafted Security please review. ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-17 14:28:00 UTC  ``` GLSA 200411-26  sci please remember to remove old vulnerable ebuilds that are no longer needed. ```  [Comment 21](#c21)  Olivier Fisette (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-18 05:53:48 UTC  ``` Removed insecure versions for "app-sci/{gimp,chessbrain}". Must hppa and ia64  mark "app-sci/setiathome-3.03-r2" stable before I remove r1, or should I remove  it immediately? ```  [Comment 22](#c22)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-18 14:01:30 UTC  ``` Yes, you should remove r1 only when hppa and ia64 mark "app-sci/setiathome-3.03-r2" stable. ```  [Comment 23](#c23)  René Nussbaumer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-26 05:03:48 UTC  ``` Removed hppa keyword because the tarball is not available ``` |  |
