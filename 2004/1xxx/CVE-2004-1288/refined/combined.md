# o3read: Buffer overflow during file conversion — GLSA **200501-20**

A buffer overflow in o3read allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by
way of a specially crafted XML file.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/o3read** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.0.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.0.4** |

### Background

o3read is a standalone converter for OpenOffice.org files. It
allows a user to dump the contents tree (o3read) and convert to plain
text (o3totxt) or to HTML (o3tohtml) Writer and Calc files.

### Description

Wiktor Kopec discovered that the parse\_html function in o3read.c
copies any number of bytes into a 1024-byte t[] array.

### Impact

Using a specially crafted file, possibly delivered by e-mail or
over the Web, an attacker may execute arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running o3read.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All o3read users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/o3read-0.0.4"
```
