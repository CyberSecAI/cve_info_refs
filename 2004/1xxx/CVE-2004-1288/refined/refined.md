- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow exists in the `parse_html` function within `o3read.c`. This function copies an arbitrary number of bytes into a fixed-size 1024-byte array (`t[]`), without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running `o3read`.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted XML file, which could be delivered via email or the web.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious XML file. The user must then execute `o3read` on that file.
