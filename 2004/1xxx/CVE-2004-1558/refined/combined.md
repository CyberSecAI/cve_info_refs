How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Vendor URL: http://yahoopops.sourceforge.net Version: YahooPOPS v0.4 up to v0.6 Vulnerability: Remote Buffer overflows  Release Date: 27 September 2004  Vendor Status:  Informed on 24 September 2004 Response: no response yet  Description:  YahooPOPs! Is an application that provides POP3 access to Yahoo! Mail. It is available on the Windows, Linux, Solaris and Mac platforms. This application emulates a POP3 & SMTP server. It also enables popular email clients like Outlook, Netscape, Eudora, Mozilla, etc., to download email from Yahoo! accounts. The Latest version of this Program is 0.6 and released in 23 May 2004 until now over 120000 users download this program.  Both POP3 and SMTP services have buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The Remote Attacker can send specific Request to these services to cause a Stack based buffer overflow which could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or just simply crash the service on a vulnerable system.  Details:  A YahooPOPS 0.x has the Local SMTP and POP3 engines to send and receive emails. SMTP service Dose not Enable By default. Users can enable SMTP by Software Options.  A POP3 USER request with more than 180 bytes will start to corrupt the heap.  POP3 request (Dos Attack):  Telnet localhost 110 +OK POP3 YahooPOPs! Proxy ready  [USER][180xA][BBBB]  As a result EAX and ECX will be overwritten.  SMTP request: Sending a request with more than 504 bytes will overwrite ESP and cause a stack based overflow.  Telnet localhost 25 220 YahooPOPs! Simple Mail Transfer Service Ready  [504xA] [BBBB]  As a result The EIP registers will be overwritten.  Proof of concept demo exploit for YPOP!

Hat-Squad Advisory: Remote Buffer overflow Vulnerability in YahooPOPS
September 22, 2004

Product: YahooPOPS!
Vendor URL: <http://yahoopops.sourceforge.net>
Version: YahooPOPS v0.4 up to v0.6
Vulnerability: Remote Buffer overflows
Release Date: 27 September 2004

Vendor Status:
Informed on 24 September 2004
Response: no response
Description:

YahooPOPs! Is an application that provides POP3 access to Yahoo! Mail. It is \
available on the Windows, Linux, Solaris and Mac platforms. This application emulates \
a POP3 & SMTP server. It also enables popular email clients like Outlook, Netscape, \
Eudora, Mozilla, etc., to download email from Yahoo! accounts. The Latest version of \
this Program is 0.6 and released in 23 May 2004 until now over 120000 users download \
this program.

Both POP3 and SMTP services have buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The Remote Attacker \
can send specific Request to these services to cause a Stack based buffer overflow \
which could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or just simply crash \
the service on a vulnerable system.
Details:

A YahooPOPS 0.x has the Local SMTP and POP3 engines to send and receive emails. SMTP \
service Dose not Enable By default. Users can enable SMTP by Software Options.

A POP3 USER request with more than 180 bytes will start to corrupt the heap.
POP3 request (Dos Attack):

Telnet localhost 110
+OK POP3 YahooPOPs! Proxy ready
[USER][180xA][BBBB]

As a result EAX and ECX will be overwritten.

SMTP request:
Sending a request with more than 504 bytes will overwrite ESP and cause a stack based \
overflow.

Telnet localhost 25
220 YahooPOPs! Simple Mail Transfer Service Ready
[504xA] [BBBB]

As a result The EIP registers will be overwritten.

Proof of concept demo exploit for YPOP! SMTP listener:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <windows.h>
#include <winsock.h>

#pragma comment(lib,"wsock32.lib")

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
