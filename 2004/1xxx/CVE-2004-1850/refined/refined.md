- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The server uses a `sockaddr_in` structure sent by the client during the join process to send subsequent packets. If the client sends a `sockaddr_in` structure with a port and IP address equal to zero, the server enters an infinite loop.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation. The server does not validate the `sockaddr_in` structure, specifically that the IP address and port are not zero.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The server freezes, causing a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a malicious join packet containing a `sockaddr_in` structure with zeroed IP and port values to the game server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the game server.
