Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Xedus Webserver:

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The webserver is susceptible to DoS attacks by a single host opening multiple connections, causing the server to deny access to all users.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Several test scripts included with the webserver do not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for XSS attacks. Specifically, the parameters `username` and `param` in `test.x`, `TestServer.x`, and `testgetrequest.x` are vulnerable.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The server does not properly sanitize file requests, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary files on the server with the privileges of the web server process.

**Root Cause:**

*   **DoS:** The server is unable to handle multiple connections originating from a single host which leads to resource exhaustion or internal errors.
*   **XSS:** Lack of input sanitization of user-supplied parameters in test scripts.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Improper input sanitization of file paths requested by the client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **DoS:** The webserver can be rendered inaccessible to all users.
*   **XSS:** An attacker can execute malicious code within the context of a victim's web browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
*   **Directory Traversal:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive files from the server, potentially including configuration files, logs, and other data, enabling further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **DoS:** Sending multiple connection requests from the same host.
*   **XSS:** Crafting malicious URLs with JavaScript payloads and enticing victims to visit these URLs.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Sending web requests with specially crafted paths that include `../` sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **DoS:** The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the vulnerable server.
*  **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted URL with malicious javascript, and the user needs to visit those URL through a browser.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the vulnerable server and craft malicious URL with `../` sequences.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided text also specifies the default port as 4274, which can be changed by administrator.
* The advisory suggests deleting the sample .x files in the `./sampledocs` directory as a workaround for the XSS issues.
* The advisory mentions that the developers of Xedus webserver were contacted but did not respond.
