The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the Event Calendar module for PHP-Nuke, version 2.13.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Poor user-submitted data handling:** The module does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied data, leading to various security issues.
*   **Lack of proper input sanitization:** Specifically, variables are not properly escaped or quoted in SQL queries and input is not validated when used in HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure (A1, A2, A3):**
    *   The `config.php`, `index.php`, and `submit.php` files reveal the full server path due to errors in including other files.
    *   This is caused by the scripts attempting to include files using relative paths without proper error handling.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (B):**
    *   The `submit.php` file is vulnerable to XSS attacks through several parameters (`type`, `day`, `month`, `year`).
    *   Malicious JavaScript code can be injected via these parameters.
*  **Script Injection in Calendar Event Comments (C):**
    *   Users can inject JavaScript code into event comments.
    *   When other users or admins view these comments, the injected scripts will execute, potentially leading to cookie theft or other malicious actions.
*   **SQL Injection (D):**
    *   The module is vulnerable to SQL injection because variables `$eid` and `$cid` are not enclosed in single quotes in SQL queries.
    *   This allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries, potentially retrieving sensitive data such as admin credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** Information leakage of the server's file system structure.
*   **XSS:**
    *   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
    *   Potential for session hijacking, defacement, or phishing.
*   **Script Injection in Calendar Event Comments:**
     *   Executing arbitrary JavaScript code.
     *   Potential for cookie theft, unauthorized actions, etc.
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Database compromise, potentially including unauthorized data access.
    *   Exposure of sensitive information, such as admin credentials.
    *   Potential for data manipulation or deletion.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** Direct access to the vulnerable files (`config.php`, `index.php`, `submit.php`) through HTTP requests.
*   **XSS:** Exploiting vulnerable URL parameters in HTTP requests to inject JavaScript.
*   **Script Injection in Calendar Event Comments:** Submitting comments containing malicious JavaScript code.
*   **SQL Injection:** Manipulating HTTP GET parameters (`eid`, `cid`) to inject SQL code, specifically when viewing an event.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** No special capabilities required; access to the web server is sufficient.
*   **XSS:** Ability to craft and send HTTP requests to the vulnerable module.
*  **Script Injection in Calendar Event Comments:** An account to add comments or in a publicly visible section.
*   **SQL Injection:** Ability to send HTTP requests, and knowledge of SQL syntax.

**Additional Information:**
*   The report provides a proof-of-concept SQL injection exploit.
*   The vendor was contacted but did not release a patch at the time of the report.
