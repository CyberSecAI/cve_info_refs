```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The `eqn2graph` and `pic2graph` scripts create temporary files in an insecure manner. The process ID (PID) used in the temporary file name is not sufficient to prevent attacks, and the scripts do not check if the temporary file already exists before using it.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insecure temporary file creation
- Race condition vulnerability due to insufficient uniqueness in temporary file names
- Lack of existence checks before using temporary files.
- Symlink attack vulnerability through the insecure creation of temporary files

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to create or overwrite files with the privileges of the user invoking the vulnerable program

Attack vectors:
An attacker can create a symlink with the name of the temporary file used by the script prior to the script creating the temporary file, this can lead to files being overwritten

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to create a symlink to a file within the location that the vulnerable program is creating temporary files.
