{
  "CVE-2004-1058": {
    "Description": "A race condition allows for a local user to read the environment variables of another process that is still spawning through /proc/.../cmdline.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Race condition when reading /proc/.../cmdline",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Race condition",
      "Information exposure"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Local user can read environment variables of other processes.",
    "Attack vectors": "/proc/.../cmdline",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local unprivileged user",
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability is caused by a race condition in the Linux kernel when accessing the /proc/[pid]/cmdline file. During the spawning of a process, the kernel may not have completely set up the processâ€™s environment variables before the /proc/[pid]/cmdline is accessed by another process. This race can allow an attacker to read the environment variables of another process, which can include sensitive information, such as passwords or encryption keys."
