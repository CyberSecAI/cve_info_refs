Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in A-CART Pro & A-CART 2.0:

**Root Cause:**
-  The application lacks proper input validation, which allows attackers to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks through the `catcode` parameter in `category.asp`.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks through user information forms in `deliver.asp` and `billing.asp`, allowing injection of HTML and script code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL statements, potentially gaining administrator access by manipulating the database.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the pages, executing them in the context of other users' browsers, possibly leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **SQL Injection:** Sending a crafted request to `/category.asp` with a malicious SQL statement in the `catcode` parameter, e.g., `category.asp?catcode=1 union all select pass,0,0,0,0 from customers where fname='[Username]'`.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code into user information forms in `deliver.asp` or `billing.asp`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the A-CART application, thus no special privileges are required.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting:**  The attacker needs to be able to submit crafted input to the user information forms in `deliver.asp` and `billing.asp` via the web interface.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The vendor was contacted multiple times with no response.
-   No solution was available at the time of reporting.
