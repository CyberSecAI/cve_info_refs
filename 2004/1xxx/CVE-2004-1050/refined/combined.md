How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-040 - Critical

## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (889293)

Published: December 01, 2004

**Version:** 1.0

**Issued:** December 1, 2004

**Version:** 1.0

#### Summary

**Who should read this document:** Customers who use Microsoft Windows

**Impact of Vulnerability:** Remote Code Execution

**Maximum Severity Rating:** Critical

**Recommendation:** Customers should install the update immediately.

**Security Update Replacement:** This update replaces the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-038](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31851). That update is also a cumulative update.

**Caveats:** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 889293](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/889293) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

**Important:** This update may not include hotfixes that have been released since the release of [MS04-004](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22189), [MS04-025](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31981) or [MS04-038](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31851).

Instead customers should deploy update [889669](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/889669).
In addition, customers who have applied either update rollup [871260](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/871260) or [873377](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/873377) must also apply update rollup [889669](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/889669) instead of the security updates accompanying security bulletin [MS04-040](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38098).

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves a newly-discovered publicly reported vulnerability. A vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer that could allow remote code execution on an affected system. The vulnerability is documented in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin.

If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

Microsoft recommends that customers install the update immediately.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Internet Explorer 6 SP1 (All versions earlier than Windows Server 2003) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTML Elements Vulnerability - [CAN-2004-1050](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2004-1050) | Remote Code Execution | Critical |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces previously released security bulletins for Internet Explorer. The most recent security bulletin and Internet Explorer versions that are affected are listed in following table.

| Bulletin ID | Internet Explorer 6 SP1 (All versions earlier than Windows Server 2003) |
| --- | --- |
| **MS04-038** | Replaced |

**I have received a hotfix from Microsoft or my support provider since the release of MS04-004. Is that hotfix included in this Security Update?**

For Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 for Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, Windows XP Service Pack 1, Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6, Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Me, most Internet Explorer hotfixes are not included in the [MS04-040](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38098) security update. When you install any of the [MS04-040](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38098) security updates for Internet Explorer 6 SP1, Internet Explorer hotfixes released since [MS04-004](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22189) will be removed if the hotfix replaced any of the files listed in the "Security Update Information" section of this bulletin.

Starting with [MS04-038](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31851), cumulative hotfixes for Internet Explorer are available in a separate update rollup that includes both cumulative hotfixes and the security fixes included in the latest security update for Internet Explorer. For example, update rollup 871260 includes the cumulative security fixes in [MS04-038](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31851) as well as hotfixes released since [MS04-004](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22189).

Yes. MBSA will determine if this update is required. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**Note** After April 20, 2004, the Mssecure.xml file that is used by MBSA 1.1.1 and earlier versions is no longer being updated with new security bulletin data. Therefore, scans that are performed after that date with MBSA 1.1.1 or earlier will be incomplete. All users should upgrade to MBSA 1.2 because it provides more accurate security update detection and supports additional products. Users can download MBSA 1.2 from the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about MBSA support, visit the following [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer 1.2 Q&A; Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33332).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine if this update is required?**

As noted in the Affected Components section of this bulletin, this release includes two packages for Internet Explorer 6 SP1. One package is designed for Windows 2000 and Windows XP Service Pack 1. This package uses the Update.exe installation technology discussed above. The second package is designed for Windows NT, Windows 98, and Windows Me. MBSA is not able to determine which Internet Explorer 6 SP1 update is required for a specific Operating System. A package intended for SMS Deployment only has been created that contains both versions of the Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 updates. When deployed with SMS, this package will detect the operating system and install the correct version of the update for that operating system. MBSA, when used with SMS, will instruct SMS administrators to deploy this SMS Deployment package.

## Vulnerability Details

#### HTML Elements Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1050:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer that could allow remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web Page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for HTML Elements Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1050:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.
* By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018 has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

  The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

  + Install the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-040](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-040) or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
  + Use Microsoft Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 with the Microsoft Outlook E-mail Security Update installed
  + Use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or later or Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or later in their default configuration.
* **The following software is not affected by this vulnerability.**

  + Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 3
  + Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4
  + Internet Explorer 5.5 Service Pack 2 on Windows Millennium Edition (Me)
  + Internet Explorer 6 on Windows Server 2003
  + Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP Service Pack 2

#### Workarounds for HTML Elements Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1050:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Install the** **Outlook E-mail Security Update** **if you are using Outlook 2000 SP1 or earlier.**

  By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been applied.

  Customers who use any of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.

#### FAQ for HTML Elements Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1050:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in Internet Explorer processing of certain HTML elements such as FRAME and IFRAME elements.

**What are IFRAME elements?**

Inline Floating Frames (IFRAME) is a technology that allows Web authors to have increased control of the design and interaction of their Web pages. For more information about IFRAME elements, visit this [Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537627.aspx).

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious Web page and persuading the user to visit the page. When the user has visited the page, the attacker could access information from other Web sites, access local files on the system, or cause malicious code to run as the locally logged on user.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires a user to view Web sites for malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as users' workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

It should be noted that FRAME and IFRAME elements are not rendered in the restricted zone, which is the zone where Outlook Express and Outlook by default open HTML email messages. Exploitation of this vulnerability through e-mail therefore requires user interaction in the form of a malicious link in the e-mail message. See the Workarounds Section in this bulletin for more information about this.

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?**

Yes. Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition are critically affected by this vulnerability. A Critical security update for these platforms is available and is provided as part of this security bulletin and can be downloaded from the [Windows Update Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130). For more information about severity ratings, visit this [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer validates the length of a message while processing HTML elements.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CAN-2004-1050.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. When the security bulletin was released, Microsoft had received information that this vulnerability was being exploited.

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. This tool allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results pane**, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name box**, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by confirming that an isInstalled DWORD value with a data value of 1 exists in the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{839117ee-2132-4bae-a56a-42b50204c9b9}
* **Program Version Verification**

  Confirm that **Q889293** is listed in the **Update Versions** field in the **About Internet Explorer** dialog box

## Microsoft Internet Explorer vulnerable to buffer overflow via FRAME and IFRAME elements

#### Vulnerability Note VU#842160

Original Release Date: 2004-11-03 | Last Revised: 2004-12-10

---

### Overview

Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) contains a buffer overflow vulnerability that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running IE.

### Description

| A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the way IE handles the SRC and NAME attributes of HTML elements such as FRAME and IFRAME. Publicly available exploit code uses JavaScript to prepare the heap by allocating memory with blocks that consist of NOP slides and shell code. After mishandling overly long SRC and NAME attributes, IE dereferences a memory address that may fall within one of the prepared heap blocks, running through the NOP slide and executing the attacker's shell code. Without the ability to prepare the heap (i.e., without Active scripting), it becomes more difficult for the attacker to execute arbitrary code. Note, however, that an attacker could use techniques other than Active scripting to prepare the heap to more easily execute arbitrary code.  It appears that this vulnerability was discovered using the [mangleme](http://freshmeat.net/projects/mangleme/) tool.Other programs (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express, AOL, Lotus Notes) that use the WebBrowser ActiveX control could be affected by this vulnerability.Based on currently available information, IE 6 on Windows XP SP2 is not vulnerable. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message), an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could also cause IE (or the program using the WebBrowser control) to crash.Public reports indicate that this vulnerability is used by malicious code called Bofra (also identified as variants of [W32/MyDoom](http://www.us-cert.gov/current/current_activity.html#w32/mydoom)). |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a Patch**Apply the patch referenced in [MS04-040](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-040.mspx). |
| --- |

| **Install Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2)**Microsoft [Windows XP SP2](http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/alerts/SA04-243A.html) is not affected by this vulnerability.**Disable Active scripting**Disabling Active scripting makes it somwehat more difficult for an attacker to prepare the heap to easily execute arbitrary code. At a minimum, disable Active scripting in the Internet zone and the zone used by Outlook, Outlook Express, or any other software that uses the WebBrowser ActiveX control. Instructions for disabling Active scripting can be found in the [Malicious Web Scripts FAQ](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_FAQ.html#ie56). Note that an attacker may be able to prepare the heap using other techinques, in which case disabling Active scripting would only provides defense against attacks that use Active scripting.**Do not follow unsolicited links**Do not click on unsolicited URLs received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels.**Use current versions of Outlook or Outlook Express**By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 use the Restricted Sites Zone to display HTML messages. Because IFRAME and FRAME elements are not rendered in the Restricted Sites Zone, these email clients do not act as attack vectors by default.**Render email in plain text**Configure email client software (mail user agent [MUA]) to render email messages in plain text. Instructions to configure Outlook 2002, Outlook 2003, and Outlook Express 6 are available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Articles [307594](http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=307594), [831607](http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=831607), and [291387](http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=291387), respectively.**Maintain updated antivirus software**[Antivirus software](http://www.cert.org/other_sources/viruses.html#VI) with updated virus definitions may identify and prevent some exploit attempts. Variations of exploits or attack vectors may not be detected. Do not rely on antivirus software to defend against this vulnerability. |
