  "CVE-2004-1050": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer that could allow remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web Page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "An unchecked buffer in Internet Explorer processing of certain HTML elements such as FRAME and IFRAME elements. The vulnerability lies in how IE handles the SRC and NAME attributes of these HTML elements.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap buffer overflow when processing FRAME and IFRAME elements.",
         "Mishandling of overly long SRC and NAME attributes"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution with the privileges of the user running Internet Explorer. An attacker could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges.  System crashes of IE or programs using the WebBrowser ActiveX control could also occur.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafting a malicious web page containing specially crafted FRAME or IFRAME elements with overly long SRC and NAME attributes.",
        "Persuading a user to visit the malicious page."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious HTML document (web page or HTML email). The attacker would need to host the malicious web page and then persuade a user to visit the site. If exploiting via email the attacker needs to persuade the victim to click on a link within the email. The attacker gains the privileges of the user.",
    "additional_information": "Publicly available exploit code uses JavaScript to prepare the heap by allocating memory with blocks that consist of NOP slides and shell code.  After the heap is prepared by an attacker and the vulnerability is triggered, IE dereferences a memory address that may fall within one of the prepared heap blocks, running through the NOP slide and executing the attacker's shell code.  Disabling Active scripting makes it more difficult for an attacker to prepare the heap, but it's not a complete solution as other techniques can be used to achieve the same goal. Other programs (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express, AOL, Lotus Notes) that use the WebBrowser ActiveX control could be affected."
