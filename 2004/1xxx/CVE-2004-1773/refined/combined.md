Subject: sharutils: shar obscure fscanf() buffer overflow
Package: sharutils
Version: 1:4.2.1-11
Severity: normal
Tags: patch

Hello,

I have found an obscure buffer overflow in shar from the sharutils 4.2.1
package.

The shar command executes wc when creating shar archives. In the rather
unlikely scenario where there is a malicious wc command installed that
prints lots of output, a buffer overflow will occur in shar, because of a
"%s" format string in an fscanf() call in shar.c.

This is of course no serious security threat. Nevertheless, I think it
is worth fixing, as the Right Thing for a program should be not to assume
anything about its input and to handle various problems well.

I have attached a patch against sharutils-4.2.1 upstream and an evil wc
command that exhibits this problem in shar on my machine.

I have already reported this upstream:

Hi,
there seems to be an exploit for this vulnerability:
<http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2004-09/att-0792/sharexploit.c>

I'm tagging this bug "security", so that the security team can
double-check whether this needs fixing for Woody and whether this
has to reach Sarge.

Cheers,

         Moritz

# sharutils: Buffer overflows in shar.c and unshar.c — GLSA **200410-01**

sharutils contains two buffer overflow vulnerabilities that could lead to
arbitrary code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/sharutils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **4.2.1-r9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.1-r10** |

### Background

sharutils contains utilities to manage shell archives.

### Description

sharutils contains two buffer overflows. Ulf Harnhammar discovered a
buffer overflow in shar.c, where the length of data returned by the wc
command is not checked. Florian Schilhabel discovered another buffer
overflow in unshar.c.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary
code as the user running one of the sharutils programs.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All sharutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=app-arch/sharutils-4.2.1-r10"
 # emerge ">=app-arch/sharutils-4.2.1-r10"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Ilian Zarov    2002-02-11 14:27:31 UTC  ``` Hi, a new version of nbtscan has been released. NBTscan is a program for scanning IP networks for NetBIOS name information. It sends NetBIOS status query to each address in supplied range and lists received information in human readable form. For each responded host it lists IP address, NetBIOS computer name, logged-in user name and MAC address.  Copying the old .ebuild to nbtscan-1.0.3.ebuild should do the work.  For more information <http://www.inetcat.org/software/nbtscan.html> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Bruce A. Locke (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-12 20:58:09 UTC  ```  Updated.  Thank you for the bug report.  ``` |  |
