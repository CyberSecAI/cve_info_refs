Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CERT VU#920238, which is related to the provided CVE-2004-1758:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how BEA WebLogic Server handles database credentials within the `config.xml` file. Specifically, the server stores the database username and password in clear text under the following conditions:

*   When a JDBC connection pool is not targeted to a server but has database credentials configured.
*   When a JDBC connection pool is untargeted from all servers and then has its password changed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The primary weakness is the storage of database usernames and passwords in clear text within the `config.xml` file, a configuration file often accessible by administrators or those with system access.
*   **Insecure Credential Handling:** The vulnerability arises from not properly encrypting or securely storing the database credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** An attacker who gains access to the `config.xml` file can retrieve the database username and password. This allows the attacker to connect to and potentially compromise the database.
*   **Data Breach:** If the database contains sensitive data, this vulnerability could lead to a data breach.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Access:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker gaining access to the file system where the `config.xml` is stored. This could be achieved via:
    *   Compromising a system administrator account.
    *   Exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain system access.
    *   Physical access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the server's filesystem where the `config.xml` file resides. This requires some level of access to the server.
*   No other special privileges or skills are explicitly mentioned.

**Additional details:**

*   The CERT advisory specifies that this affects WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express versions 8.1 through Service Pack 2, 7.0 through Service Pack 4, and 6.1 through Service Pack 6.
*   BEA provided patches to address this issue, including specific patches for versions 8.1 and 6.1, and recommending upgrading to a patched service pack for version 7.0.
