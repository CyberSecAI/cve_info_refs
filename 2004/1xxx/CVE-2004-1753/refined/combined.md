How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

there are similar reports ([bug 116766](/show_bug.cgi?id=116766 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - [windows] java and all other plugins flickers through active tab on resize because its child window is getting WM_PAINT or WM_WM_ERASEBKGND handled by DefWindowProc"), [bug 162102](/show_bug.cgi?id=162102 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - java clock will be visible over other pages when it's tab is in the background")) but I am unable to reproduce
on a current CVS, Linux.

R.K.Aa: this bug was filed about the Apple java plug-in, so I wouldn't expect to
be able to reproduce this on linux.
On Mac, I've only seen this problem with the Apple plug-in. The MRJ plug-in
hasn't exhibited this problem. Confusing factors are: Apple plug-in is for
10.2; Mozilla MRJ plug-in doesn't work yet on 10.2. When the Mozilla MRJ
plug-in works on 10.2 this will probably be easier to pinpoint.
I suspect this will turn out to be a dup of [bug 162102](/show_bug.cgi?id=162102 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - java clock will be visible over other pages when it's tab is in the background"), but I don't see the data
yet to call it. The java plug-in on Windows and 10.2 could be not implementing
something properly that the Mozilla MRJ plug-in does or maybe the MRJ plug-in
works around a Mozilla problem. Both cases would make this a dup of [bug 162102](/show_bug.cgi?id=162102 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - java clock will be visible over other pages when it's tab is in the background").

You'll need to have tabs set to 'load links in the background' and 'middle click
or control click of links on a web page' for this test case to work as-is.

I can only reproduce this issue when using the branch OS X build (2002-10-14-05)
when toggling between tabs. Tested under 10.2.1.
Steps to reproduce
1) Load this applet in the first tab:
<http://mozilla.org/quality/browser/standards/html/applet_align_middle.html>
2) Create a second tab and the go to a url like apple.com
3) Now, click on first tab to bring to front.
4) Click on second tab to bring to front again.
5) Continue steps 3 & 4 a few times. The applet in tab 1 will randomly paint in
the second tab's window.

1)Go to
<http://www.weather.com/activities/verticalvideo/vdaily/weekendoutlook.html?from=nchomepage>
2) After real plugin has been initialzed, press command T to create a new tab.
3) Real content should appear in this tabbed window.

scroll and if you switch to another tab, it draws through. this isn't

Felix, this bug isn't about the status bar, it's a drawing bug with plug-ins.
Perhaps related to this bug: I've noticed on 2003040708, that if I have a
blinking text insertion-point cursor in a textarea, like this one I'm typing in
now, and I open a new tab, sometimes (but not always) the cursor blinks through
to the other tab.

Hrm, setting the clip region of the port doesn't do any good, for either plugin.
We also set the clipRect on the NPWindow to be empty, and they ignore that too.
I think this is a problem with those plugins. I'm not sure what we can do to fix it.

I took a look at this bug in the debugger and it looks like we are correctly
calling SetWindow(NULL) on the plugins when it gets hidden (either by switching
tabs or changing CSS visibility) so it looks like bugs in the plugins.
I've contacted Apple and they'll fix their Java plugin to correctly respond to
SetWindow(NULL) calls which should fix this bug. Real Player needs to be updated
for Mach-O and they'll fix this at the same time.Flags: blocking1.4+ → blocking1.4?Whiteboard: [adt1][ETA: 5/29] → [adt1][ETA: vendor update]

CC'ing self.
As someone already mentioned, the BBC ticker is a fine example:
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/>
Other examples include this display of Lunar phases, and another
of Jupiter and its moons:
<http://home.attbi.com/~psmcd/app.html>
And the Yahoo! game "Text Twist", and their crossword:
<http://games.yahoo.com/games/downloads/tx.html>
<http://games.yahoo.com/games/gen/cwpuz/puz_030530.html>
Note that the second link will probably only be available for
about two weeks from today; you can get to the current set of
available crosswords at:
<http://games.yahoo.com/games/cw.hf2k>
This is with Mozilla 1.4rc1, OSX 10.2.6, Apple Java 1.4.1
Steps to reproduce are as indicated elsewhere.
1. open new window.
2. open new tab.
3. switch back to first tab, load any of the pages with Java
applets that update themselves
4. switch to second tab. watch applet paint through.
5. switch to first tab. scroll. watch applet output in old
positions not get cleaned up.
6. give an applet focus (the crossword applet is great for this).
7. switch to second tab.
8. type. note that java applet still has focus, and merrily
paints through to second tab.

I'm also seeing this with the Quicktime Plug-In now:
<http://www.path.unimelb.edu.au/~dersch/html/Micros.html>
The image overdraws where the controller should be on scroll. This appears to
be a very common plug-in coding mistake.
Assuming that all the plug-ins are really broken, would it be possible to mimic
the work-around that Safari uses? With Safari shipping with 10.3 as the default
browser, plug-in vendors will likely test against that, so this problem may
recur frequently if we don't implement whatever work-around Safari uses. I
know, inelegant, hackish, etc., but perhaps the problem is already as pervasive
as it is because IE does something similar?

which, in turn, mentions that there are 5 or 6 places a java plug-in gets

In Panther, this problem can draw over the screen of another user with Fast User
Switching.
e.g., start loading:
<http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/qtvr_apart_2.html>
and switch to another user. The plug-in draws on the other user's screen.
So the problem doesn't seem to be constrained to drawing over other Mozilla
windows, it's going all weird at a lower level.

Personally, I think it's pretty sad that this bug has been in the system for
over a year and nothing's been done about it. Come on guys, other browsers don't
have this problem, it can't be fundamentally unsolveable. I recently reported 4
bugs to Firebird and they were all fixed within a week, yet this one bug I've
been dealing with for over a year! Get your acts together, please.
I could 42 duplicates of this bug, doesn't that say something?!? This is the
kind of thing that makes me lose faith in the open source philosophy.

> it can't be fundamentally unsolveable
The problem is not under our control. We're doing everything we can to tell
plugins not to draw when they are in non-visible tabs (by setting their 'plugin
window' to null), but the plugins are ignoring this. The bug has been
acknowledged by the author of Apple's Java plugin, at least. Fixing this bug
requires the plugins to be revved, and, since Mozilla now has little clout with
plugin developers, this is unlikely to happen.

This might be a dumb question - I've never tried anything like this, but I'll throw it out just in case:
If the issue is the Carbon drawing environment (vs. Cocoa) and Mozilla is the last Carbon browser
of import (so it's not being noticed), would it be feasible to embed a Cocoa drawing widget just for
plugins, then hand that off to the plugins to draw in? I think I saw some sample code on the ADC
site for doing the cross-toolkit embedding. Maybe some Camino code could be reused once the
drawing area is setup?
I also wonder if there's an OS bug here too - nothing should be able to draw through to
different user screens. I was going to file a bug in radar, but I'm not clueful enough about this to
write a good bug.
noise: please don't berate the Mozilla volunteers.

> could someone explain how it's a plugin problem if safari doesn't have the same

Safari is a Cocoa-native app, though I'm not sure how it's able to allow plugins
to draw with QuickDraw. Camino is a Cocoa app which uses NSQuickDrawView for
rendering, and has a bunch of hacks because plugins expect to be living in a
Carbon world, where there is a single GrafPort per window (unlike the NSQDView
model of a GrafPort per cocoa view). Throw Quartz Extreme into the mix, and
things get very messy.

Also of note is that applets take input from other tabs too. I noticed at this
page:
<http://www.esbuy.com/dvblbefisped.html>
there is a java navigation applet, which when you switch to other tabs still
does its thing if you mouse over the right spot.
I wonder if keypresses go through as well - could somebody craft a
full-window-size clear window applet with some fancy DOM that would load
invisibly behind a page and steal key input from other tabs?

Attached image
[Text draws through loading image](attachment.cgi?id=141511)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=141511&action=edit)

This is an interesting case - text from the "previous" tab is drawn in the
place of an image on the current tab that is in the process of loading.
Once the image is "loaded" the draw-through doesn't occur. Don't know the
internals of how this works - does something get marked "done" when something
like an image loads? Could there be an bug in the code to handle "undone" page
bits? Any chance plugins aren't marked done? I know, stabbing in the dark.
A slow network connection is probably necessary for recreating this. Who
thought my 26k line would ever come in handy? :)

I am using Mozilla 1.7.2 (Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; nl-NL;
rv:1.7.2) Gecko/20040803) and I am still seeing this. Based on the massive
number of duplicates, I can see a lot of people are unhappy about this one.
I checked [bug 197813](/show_bug.cgi?id=197813 "RESOLVED FIXED - Support Java 1.4.x/1.5.x applets, JavaPluginCocoa.bundle") to see if this is related to the old Java 1.3.1 plugins
that Mozilla normally uses, but from what I can see, this is unrelated. BTW,
that bug says this error is not limited to Mac OSX.
With the new good press and high momentum Mozilla and Firefox enjoy, is there
any chance of nudging Apple into action here?

To be explicit, this bug also exists in Firefox, and is very annoying, as my
homepage contains a Java applet. It is a highly visible issue that could
potentially drive people away, and should really be fixed for Firefox 1.0, if at
all possible. Nominating to block aviary 1.0mac.Flags: blocking-aviary1.0mac?

I just had an interesting problem that may be closely related... Rather than a
tab drawing through the plugin, I just had a plugin (Java) that floated over all
the tabs. I'm attaching a couple of screenshots (I can't reproduce it); if you
think it's a separate bug just let me know and I'll re-file.

With the release of Firefox 1.0, a ton of people are seeing this bug.
For every one person who reports this bug, there must be thousands of
people who hit is without reporting it. Maybe we should have a petition
website where we can enlist users to encourage Apple to get this fixed.

From <http://developer.apple.com/java/faq/#anchor4>
4: What J2SE version do Java applets run under inside a browser?
Apple’s Safari browser only supports Java applets under J2SE 1.4.x. Other
browsers are currently developed to specifically use our 1.3.1 implementation,
and will need to be updated. If you would like to see your favorite browser use
1.4.x on Mac OS X, please contact the vendor and ask them to work with Apple to
adopt the newer version.

<http://javaplugin.sourceforge.net/Readme.html>
The Java Embedding Plugin is a utility that allows other web browsers than
Apple's Safari to use the most recent versions of Java (1.4.X) on Mac OS X. When
used together with an updated version of Mozilla's MRJ Plugin Carbon (included
in this distribution), the Java Embedding Plugin's functionality is currently
available to recent versions of Mozilla, Firefox and Camino. But in principle
any web browser could use one of the Java Embedding Plugin's two APIs to add
support for Java 1.4.X.

The developer of the Java Embedding Plugin can't replicate this bug in Firefox.
Here are the steps I follow to show the bug when running Firefox.
Load up <http://www.fantasyasylum.com>
Open a new tab and load
<http://www.google.com/firefox?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official>
Select a bunch of the text and then de-select it
Change back to fantasy asylum and then back to the Google page. Drawing problems
are now evident.
Is anyone else able to see this bug in Firefox when following the same steps
I've followed?

For me the drawing problems are there as soon as open a new tab. I didn't have to follow any of the
subsequent steps (like selecting text and switching tabs) to see the java scroll box of the first page in
the new tab.

could a Java applet be embedded in a page?

I'm the developer of the Java Embedding Plugin, which seems to
(mostly) resolve this bug.
<http://javaplugin.sourceforge.net/>
As best I can tell, the problem is completely resolved in recent
versions of Firefox (e.g. 1.0) and Camino (e.g. 0.8.2), and partially
resolved in Mozilla (1.7.3, 1.7.5 and 1.8a). The remaining issues
with Mozilla are, I believe, Mozilla's fault (I'll deal with this in a
separate message, after I've had a chance to file a bug report).
But Jeff Leigh has found a way (detailed in his [comment #161](/show_bug.cgi?id=162134#c161 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - [OSX] Java applets draw on wrong tabs")) to make
the problem occur even with Firefox 1.0 and the latest versions of the
Java Embedding Plugin (0.8.8 and 0.8.9). I'm not able to reproduce
what he reports. So the question is, are any of you able to?
If anyone using the latest version of the JEP (currently 0.8.9) and
either Firefox or Camino can consistently make an applet draw in the
"wrong" tab (whether or not you follow the instructions in [comment
#161](/show_bug.cgi?id=162134#c161 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - [OSX] Java applets draw on wrong tabs")), please post here and give a detailed description of what
happens and how you can make it happen.

The short answer is "if you have to ask, you're not using it" :-)
But here's another, slightly more long-winded answer:
Look in your "/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/" and "~/Library/Internet
Plug-Ins/" directories for files named "JavaEmbeddingPlugin.bundle"
and "MRJPlugin.plugin".
If you find either of these files in your "~/Library/Internet
Plug-Ins/" directory (the "Library/Internet Plug-Ins/" directory under
your home directory), drag them out -- having them there will just
confuse you.
If you find both files in your "/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/"
directory, you're \_probably\_ using some version of the Java Embedding
Plugin. To make sure, use "Get Info" on both files. If your
"MRJPlugin.plugin" file's version is something like "1.0-JEP-0.8.9",
you got it from the Java Embedding Plugin. The "Get Info" version
number for "JavaEmbeddingPlugin.bundle" should be something like
"0.8.9". The two version numbers need to match.
For more information see <http://javaplugin.sourceforge.net/>

Yes. I reached the same conclusion. At first I visited the site, and noted that the bug was there (with FF
1.0, X.3.7). So, I followed your link, installed the new plugin, and the bug was gone. In fact, rendering
of the clock seemed sharper, too. Kudos.
So, I'm straight. In about 5 minutes I verified that the latest JEP (0.8.9) fixes the problem.

Attached image
[Screenshot of issue from comment #161](attachment.cgi?id=170306)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=170306&action=edit)

Using the latest version of the JEP (downloaded today) and Firefox 1.0 (on Mac
OS X 10.3.7), I saw the issue described by [comment #161](/show_bug.cgi?id=162134#c161 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - [OSX] Java applets draw on wrong tabs") on the first try. But
then after that, I could only reproduce it sporadically...not every time. I've
attached a screenshot of what I saw. I loaded the first page into a tab, then
loaded the Google page in another tab, then highlighted some of the text and
clicked outside it, and then clicked back and forth and saw it. But like I
said, I've been going crazy trying to reproduce it more, because it doesn't
happen for me MOST of the time...only 2 or 3 times after at least a dozen
attempts...
I'd also like to note that since installing the JEP, I have not seen applets
drawing on the wrong tab on sites where I used to see it, which I am very happy
about since my homepage uses a Java applet. So thanks!

I think the effect you're seeing there is a separate issue from the main problem
Java applets and other plug-ins have had with drawing.
Take a look at this page, for instance:
<http://www.duckware.com/jexepack/index.html>
This page doesn't use any Java applets or Real or QT or Flash, just a JavaScript
that doodles multi-colored line across a web page. The effect leaks through from
one tab to another -- so apart from how plug-ins work, I think there a more
general problem with tab panes being properly respected by other tab panes.
All in all, I take this as very good news!

My bad. I'd somehow gotten the impression that the drawing was being done by a
JavaScript, not a Java applet, but now that I look at the page source... yep.
There's the applet -- spinner.class.

(In reply to [comment #176](/show_bug.cgi?id=162134#c176 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - [OSX] Java applets draw on wrong tabs"))
Thanks!!
Just before I read your message, something I'd done in Firefox had
caused the problem to happen once. Then I read your message ... and
now I've found a very simple way to reproduce the problem well over
50% of the time! I still have no idea \_why\_ this "works", but at
least now I have something to play with.
Here are the steps I followed:
1. Start Firefox 1.0.
2. Visit <http://www.fantasyasylum.com/>, and wait for the news ticker
applet to start.
3. Open a new tab.
4. Type a few characters in the new tab's location bar.
5. Use the mouse to switch back and forth between tabs. You should
often see bits of the fantasyasylum news ticker applet in the blank
tab after you've switched away from the fantasyasylum tab.
6. Delete the characters in the blank tab's location bar.
7. Use the mouse to switch back and forth between tabs. Now you
should never see debris from the news ticker applet when switching
to the blank tab.

Your procedure works for me, using the exact steps you describe. I dare say
that the applet bled through "most" of the time (while characters were in the
address bar of the empty tab), but it was there at least 50% of the time...

(Following up [comment #180](/show_bug.cgi?id=162134#c180 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - [OSX] Java applets draw on wrong tabs"))
Now that I have your attention, let's continue our journey into the
heart of wierdness :-)
I've come to the tentative conclusion that, when using JEP 0.8.9 and
Firefox 1.0, an applet will only draw to the "wrong" tab when the tab
to which you're switching has highlighted text in its location bar --
an applet in the "first" tab (the one you're switching away from) will
only draw into the "second" tab (the one you're switching to) if the
second tab's location bar contains highlighted text. If this is true,
then (presumably) something that happens only when a tab's location
bar contains highlighted text is causing the applet from the "first"
tab to be made invisible only after the "second" tab has been
displayed for the first time.
The procedure I described in [comment #180](/show_bug.cgi?id=162134#c180 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - [OSX] Java applets draw on wrong tabs") demonstrates debris
appearing in the "second" (blank) tab when its location bar contains
highlighted text, and not appearing when its location bar contains no
text at all. Here's a procedure that demonstrates debris not
appearing when the "second" tab's location bar contains
non-highlighted text:
1. Make sure you've installed JEP 0.8.9.
2. Start Firefox 1.0.
3. Visit <http://java.sun.com/applets/jdk/1.4/demo/applets/Animator/example4.html>.
4. Open a new tab, and in it visit <http://www.fantasyasylum.com/>.
5. Click once on the text in the second tab's location bar --
"<http://www.fantasyasylum.com/>" will be highlighted.
6. Switch to the first tab -- no debris should appear.
7. Switch to the second tab -- "<http://www.fantasyasylum.com/>" will no
longer be highlighted, but the text-entry cursor will be flashing
in the second tab's location bar; no debris should appear.
8. Switch to the first tab -- no debris should appear.
9. Switch to the second tab -- "<http://www.fantasyasylum.com/>" will
now be highlighted, and debris from the Animator applet in the
first tab should now appear in the second tab.
10. Switch back and forth a few more times between tabs -- debris
should never appear in the first tab but almost always in the
second tab.
11. Switch to the second tab, delete the highlighted text in its
location bar (the Delete key will do the job), and click the mouse
somewhere in the content area of the second tab's window
(i.e. make the text-entry cursor disappear from the second tab's
location bar).
12. Switch back and forth a few more times between tabs. Now the text
in both tabs' location bars should be non-highlighted, and no
debris should appear in either tab.

both are the browsers' fault (i.e. are due to bugs in Mozilla and

Well, at least the last example seems to cause the misdrawing issue for me even
though I am using JEP and a trunk build from 2 days ago (although I am using the
optimized g4 builds so not official). Since I'm not actually clear how firefox
knows which plugin to use (both java plugins are listed though JEP is newer...I
presume this was what all that bit about checking the file modification time was
about.
Unless, I'm very confused doesn't this show that JEP doesn't resolve these
issues. Also, how would one check if a case belonged in the 'mistiming redraw'
bug or just in this bug? Or is this something one would need to add debugging
statements to a plugin to discover. Finally if this is really a cocoa/carbon
API issue shouldn't it be fairly easy to whip up a short little program
documenting the API error? Or was this assertion just a guess since we don't
really know what is going on?

This page doesn't use any applets. And as of this morning, at least,
it's broken on OS X -- nothing shows up in what I assume is its
ticker. If you look at the page source you'll see no applet tags but
two embed tags -- one (commented out) for the Flash plugin and one for
the Windows Media Player! I assume the problems you had were with the
Flash plugin, before it was commented out -- too bad that happened,
because it's never been completely certain that this bug ([bug 162134](/show_bug.cgi?id=162134 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - [OSX] Java applets draw on wrong tabs"))
is only an issue with Java applets.

Yes.

It doesn't resolve them completely. But it does a \_much\_ better job
than Apple's Java Applet.plugin, even on Mozilla. The issues that
remain are relatively minor. And (I think) they're caused by bugs in
Mozilla and Firefox.
> Also, how would one check if a case belonged in the 'mistiming

That's one of the reasons (the main reason) I added the
"-Djep.debug.visibility" flag to JEP 0.8.9. Java Applet.plugin can't
(of course) give you this information. I suppose I could add similar
debugging code to the MRJ Plugin JEP, to see if there is any
difference in how the Mozilla-family browsers behave when using Java
1.3.1.

While this is possible, I think it's unlikely. The timing issues are
in Carbon-only browsers. In any case we certainly don't know \_which\_
API there might be an issue with.

I don't buy that. Safari doen't show this problem (with tabs), so they must be
fixing it somehow.
This bug should be attacked as hard as possible because it is a killer. The
first time a user sees this, it will go right back to Safari/IE/Opera.

Well, I think a good start would be to try and narrow down exactly what API has
the error or problem. At the moment we seem to have a much to vague grasp of
what is going on to say what is or is not possible.
The fact that safari doesn't have this bug doesn't necessarily mean it is
fixable (they use a completly differnt java plugin interface no?) but without
much more detail about what is going wrong I think it is silly to assume their
is no workaround.

Some reason why this really is hard:
1. When the plugin API was developed, oh, 8-10 years ago, no-one had
heard of browser tabs. A plugin was either in the window, or it wasn't.
There is no affordance in the NPAPI for the browser to tell a plugin that it
is in a non-visible tab.
As a result, we've had to use SetWindow(NULL) type things, but these require
the plugin authors to pay attention to them. Not all plugins do.
2. The Mac OS X browser and plugin space is complex. Not only are there both
CFM and Mach-O plugins, but the drawing environments in the different
browsers are different: Safari is a pure cocoa app, Camino uses QuickDraw
in a cocoa framework, and mozilla/ff are pure QuickDraw. This affects stuff
like tab drawing, and drawing coordinates.
3. Some plugins draw on threads (Java), so you have synchronization issues
tell it not to draw.
4. Some plugins (QuickTime, Real) do Quartz Extreme acceleration stuff,
which can interfere with the browsers attempts to do clipping or hide
widgets in non-frontmost tabs. There are obvious bugs in some plugins
related to this (Director draws at the wrong offset when using the
hardware renderer).
Finally, Mozilla has less clout with plugn vendors than Apple does. It's hard to
get them to address the bugs in their plugins that we need to get fixed.

I looked again at this.
First off, the issue is worse in Firefox/Mozilla than Camino because Camino has
this:
<<http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/widget/src/cocoa/nsChildView.mm#1178>>
Mac widget needs to do something similar, but we'll have to feed the notfication
all the way down the widget hierarchy when a widget is made invisible.
Second, I have a minor patch that makes Java better (tested in Camino, because
it relies on the code above). I also was not able to see any problems with
QuickTime.
However, Real contents is most serious; it draws over all tabs, and even
resizing the window or getting the page to redraw does not erase the Real bits.
It seems that they are being drawn to the screen via OpenGL or something that is
bypassing clipping. (Interestingly, if the plugin is scrolled partially
offscreen, it doesn't stomp over other tabs. I bet it falls back into a software
rendering path there.)Assignee: peterl-bugs → sfraser\_bugs

mInstance->SetWindow(nsnull) is a no-op (since ns4xPluginInstance::SetWindow()
does a null-check and bails) so there's no point calling it. Rather, make sure
the clip rect is empty if the plugin is not visible, and call
mInstance->SetWindow(mPluginWindow) which (depending on the plugin) may or may
not get it to take notice.

Hrm. I can almost fix Real by sending it a fake
nsPluginEventType\_ScrollingEndsEvent event at hide time (maybe this gets it to
notice the changed clipping bounds). It draws once over the new tab, but is at
least erasable.
I'm testing with the plugin installed by RealPlayer 10.0.0 (v325).

I don't think moving to Quartz would help.
Regarding Java specifically, there are several issue so to be aware of:
1. There are potentially 3 java plugins out there:
i) Apple's "Java Applet" plugin
ii) Netscpe's "MRJ Plugin" (now unmaintained)
iii) Steven Michaud's "Java Embedding Plugin" (JEP).
The latter 2 both have fewer drawing problems on scrolling, and in tabs.
For simplicity, I was testing with only the Apple plugin, since it's the worst
offender.
2. Drawing issues are worse in Firefox than Camino.
For reasons that I don't fully understand, Camino is much better behaved
plugin-wise. I don't believe that it's simply because Camino is Cocoa,
because plugins in Camino actually draw to a a window-level GrafPort.
Clipping etc. should be set up the same for plugins in both browsers.
I have a patch that helps prevent some Java applets drawing through tabs in
Firefox, with Apple's plugin. I can fix the drawing of this one:
<<http://java.sun.com/applets/jdk/1.4/demo/applets/Animator/example4.html>>
But this one still draws through tabs, and leaves crud while scrolling:
<<http://members.cox.net/gretnawx/Data/current_weather.htm>>
I do not understand why these applets behave differently. If anyone can
enlighten me, that would be good.
Finally, perhaps we should just ship the Java Embedding Plugin, since it fixes
these, and other Java issues, and allows Mozilla browsers to run the Java 1.4 VM.

[Patch to get mac widget to invalidate plugins on widget hide](attachment.cgi?id=174692&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=174692&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=162134&attachment=174692)

This patch does for Mac widget what Camino does when hiding tabs. It should
help with the timing issue described in [bug 277067](/show_bug.cgi?id=277067 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mozilla mistimes changing QuickDraw plugin visibility when switching tabs").

The problem on this site:
<<http://members.cox.net/gretnawx/Data/current_weather.htm>>
appears to only have to do with the scrolling marquee at the top of the page.
This site is operated from my hometown and I check it frequently; since I
installed the Java Embedding Plugin for Firefox I have not had trouble with any
of the other scripts (such as moon phase) -- just the marquee. It appears
that code specific to the marquee and not to the moon phase causes the problem.

What plugin and browser are you using? I am using a recent g4 optimized firefox
trunk build with the JEP and can't reproduce any junk in other tabs.
It's good to see progress being made to narrow down the exact cause of this bug
and in what API the problem rests. Though it might take some work I don't think
we can really say much about whether the problem is solveable or not until we
have a much better idea exactly where the bug is coming from.

I've now compiled this patch into CVS versions of Mozilla and Firefox
(pulled this morning), and tested both of them with the latest JEP
(0.9.0).
It seems to make no difference with Mozilla -- the problem (as
described at [bug 277067](/show_bug.cgi?id=277067 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mozilla mistimes changing QuickDraw plugin visibility when switching tabs")) is as bad as ever.
It also seems to make no difference with Firefox when using the
procedure described above in [comment #180](/show_bug.cgi?id=162134#c180 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - [OSX] Java applets draw on wrong tabs"). It \_might\_ help a bit when
using the procedure described here in [comment #184](/show_bug.cgi?id=162134#c184 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - [OSX] Java applets draw on wrong tabs") ... but it's hard
to tell.
The waters are muddied by the fact that an unrelated post-Firefox-1.0
change has a fortunate (but entirely accidental) side effect on this
problem (see [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=277067#c12](/show_bug.cgi?id=277067#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mozilla mistimes changing QuickDraw plugin visibility when switching tabs")).
Patched Firefox's behavior is (I think) pretty definitely better than
Firefox 1.0's with [comment #184](/show_bug.cgi?id=162134#c184 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - [OSX] Java applets draw on wrong tabs")'s procedure ... but then so also is
that of the latest Firefox nightly (2005-02-18-08-trunk).

I thought the MPL was compatible with a BSD-style license.
What I envision is the Mozilla-family distros including a snapshot of
the JEP (once the JEP is out of beta). The JEP would continue to
maintain its separate existence (and keep its current license).

I'm having a hard time getting a patch that works for both JEP and Real.
The RealPlayer plugin has a requirement that we have to call SetWindow() on it
any time the location or clipping change. If I do this, then JEP in Firefox is
OK, but JEP in Camino doesn't draw at all.
Stephen, I think we should define from scratch how tab swapping interacts with
plugins, fix Firefox and Camino to follow that, and then fix JEP accordingly.
There's no point you wasting time hacking around our bugs :)
Here's what I suggest:
\* Before the tab hosting plugin is hidden, we set the clip rect on each
plugin to an empty rect, and call SetWindow() on the plugin.
\* After the tab hosting a plugin is shown (this maybe later, at paint time),
we reset the clip rect on each plugin, and again call SetWindow().
Now let's make this the same in FF, Mozilla and Camino, and figure out where we
deviate from it.Status: NEW → ASSIGNED

Excellent idea. Maybe one day there'll be an API for tabbed browsing,
but for now I'll settle for this :-)

Over the next few days I'll rescan the code, do some tests, and think
through the implications of this. In the meantime do keep working on
your own, and don't be afraid to fiddle with this. If we keep in
touch, it should be possible to iron out any problems that may arise.

Now that I understand some of the issues here, there are two problems:
1. Apple's Java plugin has multiple redraw issues (we'll address this by using
the JEP)
2. There are issues with plugins that use QuickTime (which includes the Real
plugin), which only affect Camino. I've spun those off into a Camino-
specific bug, [bug 283120](/show_bug.cgi?id=283120 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Plugins that use QuickTime (incl. Real) can draw through tabs, and leave detritus during scroll").
I'll leave this bug open for the Java issues. If anyone sees plugin drawing
issues in Mozilla/Firefox which do \*NOT\* involve Java, please comment here.Summary: [OSX] (Java applet, Real, QuickTime) XPCOM plug-ins draw on wrong tabs and leave detritus during scroll → [OSX] Java applets draw on wrong tabs

Quicktime still has scrolling problems for the test cases in [comment #64](/show_bug.cgi?id=162134#c64 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - [OSX] Java applets draw on wrong tabs"), and
[comment #81](/show_bug.cgi?id=162134#c81 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - [OSX] Java applets draw on wrong tabs"). Simon, do you have a sense at this point whether that's the same
issue as through-tab drawing?

Camino Quicktime tab drawing issues are covered by [bug 156583](/show_bug.cgi?id=156583 "VERIFIED FIXED - Stray QuickTime, Real, or Java plugin frame can appear after switching to another tab").
Camino Quicktime scrolling issues are covered by [bug 160435](/show_bug.cgi?id=160435 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Scrolling content window downwards while QT movie is playing distorts movie image").

So those should be changed to Core to cover Mozilla/Firefox?

Bill: I tried scrolling and switching tabs with a QT movie in FF and didn't see
the same kind of issues that Camino shows. The movie area does go blank
sometimes, but that's a different issue.
If you see scrolling issues in FF, please post a screenshot (in an image format
like PNG please, not pdf).

Perhaps a clue - taking a screenshot of the scrolling problem with cmd-shift-4
does not result in a picture file with the damage. I got these with a
timed-screenshot from Grab. This is with a SeaMonkey nightly from last week.

This attachment is mostly an illustration that the Quicktime plugin is out of
its mind. Here it's drawing over Apple Mail (content loaded in a Mozilla
window). I would guess this behavior is also what causes it to draw through
Fast User Switching logins.

[QT redraw on embedded mov](attachment.cgi?id=175193)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=175193&action=edit)

I get the Quicktime redraw issue on my own page with embedded mov files. I
have a single frame mov displayed when the page loads, and it loads the actual
mov file when clicked on. When you scroll the page before clicking on any of
them, when you do, one of them (and this may be an issue with the embedding
code on the page?) one of them bleeds off the window onto the desktop. It
actually plays in place, but it flashes the opening frame of the mov on top of
the edge of the window, which then erases the portion on opt of the window, but
the remmnant that was outside the edge of the window is left on the desktop.

It's weird. It seems to be a bit better now (Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac
OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20051001 Firefox/1.6a1) in that you don't
get continuous draw-through, but sometimes you still get "leftovers" after
switching tabs. The animation doesn't draw through, but you get a still frame
on the tab you switched to. I'll attach a screenshot.

I didn't install the JEP. Is it installed by default in Deer Park? (Also, my
Firefox 1.0.7 on the same machine does still have the animation drawing through
problem.)
Sounds like the artifacts I'm seeing are from [bug 277067](/show_bug.cgi?id=277067 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mozilla mistimes changing QuickDraw plugin visibility when switching tabs"), so possibly this bug
is fixed?

It still seems to be happening to an extent. Only what's happening now is that some applets flash on the new tab and then disappear, and others leave a still image (or part of one) on the new tab.

I went through the most recent comments (#240 and after) and checked those duplicate bugs to see if there were still any working testcases. I found 3 but the only issue is that they don't disappear immediately on switching but appear for a fraction of a second.

I see this too, though only on the trunk (aka the 1.9.0 branch).
The problem starts happening with the 2006-09-29-trunk nightly --
i.e. with the switch to Cocoa widgets.
If this has been a problem (on the trunk) for so long, I wonder why
there've been so few reports. Could it be that it only happens with
the current version of the Real plugin?
I tested on OS X 10.5.3 with the current Real plugin (whose version
appears to be 10.1).

I'm on 10.4.11 and a version of Real Plug-In dated 4/27/2007 (no version string in Finder or about:plugins). I get the current frame drawing through tabs, but not the full motion video (of example in [comment 267](/show_bug.cgi?id=162134#c267 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - [OSX] Java applets draw on wrong tabs")).

Another good test case can be found at this <A href="<http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/iseries/v5r2/ic2924/index.htm?info/rzahy/rzahyaclco.htm>"> site</A> (at ibm.com). It's way to hard to download and isolate at the moment though.

What you report isn't this bug's general problem, but is a specific
bug in the Java Embedding Plugin (which is bundled with Mac distros of
Mozilla.org browsers, and which provides Java support on the Mac).
Or more likely it's a newly uncovered Apple bug that the JEP will need
to learn how to work around.
The testcase you've given is the only example of it that I'm aware of.
Please open a new bug on this issue -- either at
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org> or at the JEP's bugs tracker
(<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=649116&group_id=107955&func=browse>).
Thanks in advance for your new bug.
By the way, I was able to reproduce your report in Firefox 3.0.7 on OS
X 10.5.6. I don't see it in Safari (on OS X), or in Firefox 3.0.7 on
Windows XP.

I'm having a similar issue with Java on firefox. I recently signed up for playsega.com which uses java applets to play old genesis games. When loading the games in firefox they appear to load fine but the images appear off centered and if you switch tabs the applet shows on all tabs. Strangely enough if you try to play a different game they will not load at all unless you close firefox and reopen it.
They seem to work without any issue at all in Safari.
I'm using Java Plug-in 1.6.0\_17 on OS X 10.6.2 and Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7
I have tried it on my desktop running Windows Vista ultimate, firefox 3.5.7 and the latest java plugin and there is no such problem.
I can reproduce this every time as well.
I'd be more than happy to include even more information but Im not sure what the cause of this error is.

I'll bet playsega.com's Java applets use Java3D. If so, what you report is a dup of [bug 425278](/show_bug.cgi?id=425278 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - Java3D applets don't work properly with the JEP").

I suspect the problem I noticed is related to Java, so I will report it here.
When I enter a URL into <http://keepvid.com/> and it finds a useable link, a Capcha-type window opens with distorted nonsense words for me to type to show that I am a human being.
It does not show in Firefox 3.5.7 in Mac OS X 10.6.2, but it does in SeaMonkey 2.0.1 and in Camino 2.0.1, as well as in Safari 4.0.4.
