Date: December 2004

Product: Skype (<http://skype.com/>)

"Skype is free Internet telephony that just works.
 Skype is for calling other people on their computers or phones.
 Download Skype and start calling for free all over the world."

Affected versions:

Linux RPM's version 0.92.0.12, possibly others.
(Linux versions are marked as "BETA")

Problem Description:

During installation a world-writable directory "/usr/share/skype/lang" is
created.

Impact:

The directory (presumably) contains various language files used by the
skype application. An attacker could modify these files. It is unknown if
this could be used for attacking local users running the skype application.

Solution:

The problem seems to be fixed in version 0.93.0.3, which is currently
available for download from the skype website.

History:

 - Vendor notified on 19-Nov-2004
 - Vendor acknowledged problem within 40 minutes
 - Fixed version available since 21-Dec-2004

Update (February 2005):

The issue described below has re-appeared in the official (non-BETA)
version released on Feb 1, 2005. Skype were notified on Feb 10, and a
fixed version was released on Feb 14.

Vulnerable: skype-1.0.0.1-suse.i586.rpm (but see below)
Fixed:      skype-1.0.0.7-suse.i586.rpm

NB: it seems that a fixed version skype-1.0.0.1-suse.i586.rpm was
    made available on Feb 11, but without modifying the version number.
    The difference can only be seen with "rpm -qi ..." - :

conrad@adams:~> rpm -qip skype-1.0.0.1-suse.i586.rpm | grep Release
Release     : suse               Build Date: Mon Jan 31 19:00:45 2005
conrad@adams:~> rpm -qip skype-1.0.0.1b-suse.i586.rpm | grep Release
Release     : suse.hotfix1       Build Date: Fri Feb 11 14:18:39 2005
