Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Skype installer creates the directory `/usr/share/skype/lang` with world-writable permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the creation of a world-writable directory. This allows any user on the system to modify files within that directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While the initial report states that it's "unknown if this could be used for attacking local users," the ability to modify language files opens the possibility for injecting malicious code that could be executed by the Skype application. Since the language files are loaded by the application, a crafted language file could lead to code execution in the context of the Skype process.
- **Application Manipulation:** Attackers could modify language files to alter the appearance of the Skype interface or display misleading information.
- **Denial of Service:** Malicious users could corrupt the language files, preventing Skype from functioning properly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker would need local access to the machine where Skype is installed.
- **File Modification:** An attacker would need to have write permissions on the directory `/usr/share/skype/lang`, which is world-writable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user on the system where the vulnerable Skype version is installed. They do not need root or administrative privileges to modify files in `/usr/share/skype/lang`, but they do need access to a shell on that system.

**Affected Versions:**
- Linux RPM versions 0.92.0.12 and likely other beta versions.
- skype-1.0.0.1-suse.i586.rpm (initially)
- skype-1.0.0.1-suse.i586.rpm (without hotfix)

**Fixed Versions:**
- 0.93.0.3 (for the beta versions).
- skype-1.0.0.1-suse.i586.rpm (with hotfix - identified via the Release tag)
- skype-1.0.0.7-suse.i586.rpm

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability re-appeared in the official (non-beta) release of Skype.
-  A hotfix was released for the vulnerable version, but it did not change the version number; it was identified through a "Release" tag. This makes it harder to identify if a given version is vulnerable without more information.
