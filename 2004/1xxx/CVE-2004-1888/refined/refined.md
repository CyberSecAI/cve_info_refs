The provided content details a remote command execution vulnerability in Abrior's Encore Web Forum.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `display.cgi` script, which allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands through the `file` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsanitized input: The `display.cgi` script does not properly sanitize the `file` parameter, allowing the injection of shell commands.
- Lack of input validation: There's no validation or filtering of user-supplied input in the `file` parameter before being used by the script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote command execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the vulnerable web forum with the privileges of the web server user (e.g., 'apache').
- Full system compromise: Depending on the system configuration and the executed commands, a successful exploit can lead to a full system compromise.
- Data breaches: Attackers can potentially access and exfiltrate sensitive data.
- Denial of service: The server can be crashed or rendered unresponsive through malicious commands.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `display.cgi` with malicious commands in the `file` parameter.
- Web browser: The attack can be performed through any web browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the target server hosting the vulnerable web forum.
- No authentication: The vulnerability does not require prior authentication, and can be exploited by an anonymous user.
