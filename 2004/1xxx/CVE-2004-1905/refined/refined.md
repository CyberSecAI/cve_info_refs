The provided content relates to CVE-2004-1905.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in a buffer overflow within the `Internacional` property of the `ASControl.ReportHebrew.1` COM object in Panda ActiveScan 5.0. Additionally, a crash occurs when using the `SetSitesFile` function of the `ASControls.InstallEngineCtl.1` COM object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `Internacional` property of the `ASControl.ReportHebrew.1` object is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when assigned a string longer than 255 characters.
- **Crash Vulnerability:** The `SetSitesFile` function of the `ASControls.InstallEngineCtl.1` object crashes the application when called with specific parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Exploiting the buffer overflow in the `Internacional` property allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on the vulnerable machine.
- **Denial of Service:** The `SetSitesFile` function crashes the software and closes the Internet Explorer window, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote exploitation via browser:** The vulnerabilities are triggered through a web browser by creating and manipulating the vulnerable COM objects using VBScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to visit a malicious website that contains the exploit code (VBScript).
- No prior authentication is needed as the COM objects can be created remotely after the initial use of ActiveScan.
