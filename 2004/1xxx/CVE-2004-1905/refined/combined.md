===============
1) Introduction
===============

Panda ActiveScan 5.0 is a free tool for detecting and eliminating viruses.
It Detects and eliminates more than 66.000 viruses.
It Scans for viruses in e-mails and compressed files.
It Updated every day.
It Warns when new viruses appear.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

======
2) Bug
======

Panda ActiveScan 5.0 installs and registers "ascontrol.dll" which contains
the following COM objects:
ASControl Type Library:
{A52FF42A-9D92-4C41-B3B7-87EBB1B84839}
ASControl.ReportHebrew.1(any language) -
{237AFA6B-D75C-445B-9D87-68DB699FAB32}
ASControls.InstallEngineCtl.1 -
{6E449683-C509-11CF-AAFA-00AA00B6015C}
ASControl.Seleccion.1 -
{6CEC0297-FAFB-41FB-97EA-77E3081B1DFE}
ASControl.Lista.1 -
{4826196E-5CD9-4029-A1D3-789D4651D2C2}
ASControl.ControlConexion.1 -
{6FDCDD41-6C97-4A3B-9E6D-0144B66A1CE4}

After the first time ActiveScan was used, this type of object can be created
localy & remotely! This will probably effect all other languages report
object.

For Example:
Set object = CreateObject("ASControl.ReportHebrew.1" )

The vulnerability appears in the "Internacional" property of the object.
Which means that the following assignment:
object.Internacional = [Long String - 'A'>255]
Will cause a buffer overflow, allowing a remote user to run arbitary code at
system level.

Another vulnerability appears in the "SetSitesFile" function of the Install
Engine obect.
Set object = CreateObject("ASControls.InstallEngineCtl.1" )
The function recieves the following parameters:
object.SetSitesFile(url as string{must exist}, Region as const, language as
const)
However, the use of this function crashes the software.

Which means that the following assignment:
Set object = CreateObject("ASControls.InstallEngineCtl.1" )
object.SetSitesFile "<http://rafiwarez.tripod.com/ncx.exe>", ASIA, hebrew
Will cause a crash the software to crash and will close that Internet
Explorer Window.

* Addon: Panda Antivirus Titanium 7 fails to offer scanning
                by shell integration(right mouse button menu) to
non-alphabetic chars.
