  "vulnerability_summary": {
    "cross_site_scripting": {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient input sanitization of user-supplied data in various scripts.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The application attempts to block `<script>` tags but does not properly filter other XSS vectors such as `<img>` tags with `onload` attributes."
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
      "attack_vectors": "Maliciously crafted URLs with XSS payloads injected into GET parameters such as `id`, `date`, `form`, `user`, `FONTS`, and others.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it or inject the malicious code into the application itself."
    },
    "http_response_splitting": {
      "root_cause": "Lack of proper input validation in `login.php`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The application does not properly sanitize the `return_path` parameter, allowing the injection of newline characters and arbitrary HTTP headers."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can control the HTTP response headers, potentially leading to cache poisoning, cross-site scripting (XSS), or other attacks.",
      "attack_vectors": "Maliciously crafted URLs with HTTP response splitting payloads injected into the `return_path` GET parameter.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it or inject the malicious code into the application itself."
    },
     "arbitrary_code_execution": {
      "root_cause": "The application includes files specified in the `user_inc` parameter without proper validation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The application does not restrict the file paths included via the `user_inc` parameter, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code by including a malicious file uploaded to the server."
      ],
      "impact": "Complete server compromise by executing arbitrary PHP code.",
      "attack_vectors": "Malicious URLs with the file location injected into the `user_inc` parameter.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to upload a file to the server using FTP or another method, and then craft a malicious URL with the path to the file."
    },
    "full_path_disclosure": {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient validation of the `encoded_login` parameter in `validate.php`.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "The application discloses the full path of the script in the web server."
      ],
      "impact": "Exposes server-side file paths, which can assist attackers in further exploitation.",
      "attack_vectors": "Maliciously crafted URLs with the `encoded_login` parameter.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can craft a malicious URL."
    },
      "admin_privilege_escalation": {
      "root_cause": "Vulnerable scripts are susceptible to variable poisoning attacks.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The application allows modification of administrative and access-related variables via GET parameters, enabling privilege escalation."
      ],
       "impact": "Attackers can gain admin privileges and potentially take over the webcalendar application by setting variables via GET parameters.",
      "attack_vectors": "Maliciously crafted URLs injecting variables such as `is_admin`, `is_nonuser_admin`, `is_assistant` and `public_must_be_enabled`.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can craft a malicious URL."
      }
   },
  "additional_notes": [
    "The application's XSS protection is easily bypassed using Unicode encoded strings or other valid XSS attacks such as <img> tags.",
    "The developers have been responsive and the issues have been fixed in the CVS repository."
