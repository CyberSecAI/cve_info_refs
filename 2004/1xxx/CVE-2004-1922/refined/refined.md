- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Internet Explorer does not properly validate the size of a BMP image specified in the BMP file header before allocating memory for it. It relies on the size specified in the header, rather than verifying the actual file size, which can lead to allocation of huge amounts of memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory exhaustion, denial-of-service (DoS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploiting this vulnerability can cause a denial of service by exhausting system memory, leading to system instability, and potentially requiring a system restart.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by loading a specially crafted BMP file within Internet Explorer, e.g. via an `<img>` tag in a web page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to get the user to load a malicious webpage with an embedded malicious BMP file.
