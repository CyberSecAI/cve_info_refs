The provided content describes a vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer related to FTP downloads. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer handles filenames containing "../" (dot-dot-slash) sequences when downloading files from an FTP server. When a file with "../" in its name is downloaded, Internet Explorer uses these sequences to navigate up the directory structure on the local machine rather than treating them as part of the filename.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly sanitize filenames received from FTP servers, which allows for path traversal during the save operation.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** Internet Explorer does not validate or sanitize the filename received from the FTP server before using it to determine the destination path for the downloaded file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite:** An attacker can control the destination where a file downloaded from an FTP server is saved on the victim's local system. This enables overwriting existing files or creating new files in arbitrary locations on the file system where the user has write access, including startup folders.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** By placing malicious files in locations such as startup folders, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution when the user logs in to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious FTP Server:** The attack requires a malicious FTP server that sends filenames with "../" sequences in response to the `LIST` command.
*   **File Download:** The victim user must download a file using either the left-click and save-as procedure or by dragging the file from the FTP server to their local machine.
*   **File Overwriting/Creation:** The exploit leverages the ability to place files in arbitrary locations, specifically targeting locations such as startup folders to achieve code execution upon user login.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to operate a malicious FTP server accessible to the victim.
*   The attacker must be able to control the filenames returned by the FTP server during a LIST operation.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim, as long as the victim can connect to the malicious FTP server via the internet.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided text includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) FTP server written in C (`ftpd-iexpl.c`) that demonstrates the vulnerability.
*   The exploit is effective when downloading files via left-click/save-as or drag-and-drop; however, the double-click method is not vulnerable.
*   Although the user sees the complete file name including ".." sequences, the victim may be tricked into dragging a folder with a malicious file.
*   The vulnerability is noted to exist in Internet Explorer versions 6.0.3790.0 and later.
