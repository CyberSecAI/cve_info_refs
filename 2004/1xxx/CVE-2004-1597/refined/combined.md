How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

UPDATE: RIM Blackberry DoS, data loss

Original disclosure is available at <http://www.hexview.com/docs/20041012-1.txt>

Classification:
===============
Level: low-[MED]-high-crit
ID: HEXVIEW*2004*10*14*1
URL: <http://www.hexview.com/docs/20041014-1.txt>

Update summary:
===============
Vulnerability level changed to MEDIUM.
Vulnerability description is updated.
Vendor status is updated.
HexView disclosure policy is updated.

Vulnerability update:
=====================
There is no buffer overflow condition. Device reset is triggered by a watchdog timer
that times out when a long message is being stored in flash memory. Since reset
is triggered in the middle of write process, it may cause unpredictable results,
but in most cases the data does not get corrupted. HexView confirms that there was
a data corruption issue during tests, but it was not possible to reproduce it.

Vendor Status:
==============
Vendor has produced a fix for the vulnerability.

About HexView:
==============
HexView contributes to online security-related lists for almost a decade.
The scope of our expertize spreads over Windows, Linux, Sun, MacOS platforms,
network applications, and embedded devices. The chances are you read our
advisories or disclosures. For more information visit <http://www.hexview.com>

Distribution:
=============
This document may be freely distributed through any channels as long as the
contents are kept unmodified. Commercial use of the information in the document
is not allowed without written permission from HexView signed by our pgp key.

HexView Disclosure Policy:
==========================
HexView notifies vendors that have publicly available contact e-mail
24 hours before disclosing any information to the public. If we are unable
to find vendor's e-mail address or if no reply is received within 24 hours,
HexView will publish vulnerability notification including all technical
details unless the issue is rated as "critical". If vendor does not reply
within 72 hours, HexView may disclose all details for critical vulnerabilities
as well.

If vendor replies within the above mentioned time period, HexView will
announce the vulnerability, but will not disclose the details required to
reproduce it. HexView will also specify the date when full disclosure
containing all the details will be published. The time period between
announcement and full disclosure is 30 days unless there is an agreement
with vendor and appropriate justification for extension. If vendor resolves
the issue earlier than 30 days after announcement, HexView will publish full
disclosure as soon as the fix is available to the public.

HexView also reserves the right to publish any detail of any vulnerability
at any time.

RIM Blackberry buffer overflow, DoS, data loss

Classification:
===============
Level: low-med-[HIGH]-crit
ID: HEXVIEW*2004*10*12*1

Overview:
=========
RIM Blackberry is a Java-based wireless connectivity solution providing
phone, e-mail, and other services on a variety of handheld devices.

Affected products:
==================
All tests were performed on a RIM Blackberry 7230 with RIM Blackberry
Operating System software version 3.7.1.41. The Blackberry was synchronized
with Microsoft Exchange server using Blackberry Enterprise Server for
Microsoft Exchange.

Cause and Effect:
=================
Insufficient data validation for incoming calendar data makes possible
to cause buffer overflow condition leading to stack corruption. As a result,
it is possible to reboot the device (all stored messages will be lost since
RAM storage will be reinitialized). It is also possible to execute code
embedded by the attacker. It should be mentioned that Blackberry developers
tools are freely available.

Demonstration:
==============
The issue can easily be reproduced by sending a standard Microsoft Outlook
meeting request message with very long string (over 128K) in the "Location:"
field. To force immediate user notification, set meeting date/time to the
past. The Blackberry reboots when it tries to notify the user. No user action
is required. It is possible to render Blackberry device completely useless by
queuing a number of such messages into user's mailbox.

Vendor Status:
==============
At the time of release vendor was not aware of the vulnerability.
HexView does not notify vendors unless there is a prior agreement to do so.
Vendors interested in receiving notifications prior to public disclosure
or more detailed analysis may obtain more information by writing to the
e-mail address provided at the end of the document.
