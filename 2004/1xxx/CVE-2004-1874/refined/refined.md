# Vulnerability Information:
**Root cause:**
- The A-CART Pro & A-CART 2.0 application lacks proper input validation, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code and script code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the `category.asp` page. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the database.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The user information forms in `deliver.asp` and `billing.asp` are vulnerable to XSS attacks, enabling attackers to inject and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the client's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- SQL Injection: An attacker could gain administrator access by injecting malicious SQL statements, leading to complete compromise of the application and potentially the server.
- XSS: Attackers could inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the web pages.

**Attack vectors:**
- SQL Injection: By manipulating the `catcode` parameter in the URL of the `category.asp` page.
- XSS: By injecting malicious scripts into user information forms in `deliver.asp` and `billing.asp`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. For SQL Injection the attacker needs to be able to modify the `catcode` parameter in the `category.asp` URL. For the XSS vulnerability, the attacker needs to input malicious script in the user information forms in `deliver.asp` and `billing.asp`. No specific network position is mentioned and remote exploitation is possible.
