{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries in the `auth_login.php` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL injection vulnerability",
    "Path disclosure vulnerability"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass authentication, gain unauthorized access, change user passwords, and execute arbitrary commands on the system by injecting malicious SQL code.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `username` and `password` parameters in the login form, an attacker can inject SQL code into the query executed against the database. The injected SQL could modify the user password or potentially perform other malicious operations within the database, and when combined with a command injection vulnerability using the data_input_data_cache table, an attacker can execute arbitrary code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the login form of the Cacti application and inject malicious SQL code through the username and password fields, as well as the ability to write to the data_input_data_cache table. An understanding of SQL injection is required to craft the appropriate attack."
