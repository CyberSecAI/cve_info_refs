The provided content is related to CVE-2004-1002.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `ppp` daemon not properly verifying certain data structures used in the CBCP (Call Back Control Protocol) protocol.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper data validation in the CBCP protocol handling within the `ppp` daemon.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause the `pppd` server to crash due to an invalid memory access, leading to a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted packets exploiting the CBCP protocol vulnerabilities to the `pppd` server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send packets to the vulnerable `pppd` server. This may require network access or the ability to establish a ppp connection.
