- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by two ASP files, `Statsbrowse.asp` and `Generalbrowse.asp`, which do not properly sanitize user-supplied input for the `FilePath` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary paths.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Path traversal: The application fails to restrict the path provided in the `FilePath` parameter.
    - Insecure direct object reference: The application directly uses the user-provided path to access files and directories on the server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can browse any file and directory on the server, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - By crafting a URL with the `FilePath` parameter set to an arbitrary path, an attacker can use the vulnerable scripts to browse the server's filesystem.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a valid account to access the `/admin` section of the application. Once logged in, the attacker can modify the URL to exploit the vulnerability.
