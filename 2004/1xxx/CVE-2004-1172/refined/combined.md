How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#### Vulnerability Note VU#907729

Original Release Date: 2005-01-14 | Last Revised: 2006-05-01

---

### Overview

Certain versions of Veritas Backup Exec 8.x and 9.x can be remotely exploited to allow execution of arbitrary code on affected servers.

### Description

| A buffer overflow exists in Veritas Backup Exec 8.x (prior to 8.60.3878 Hotfix 68), and 9.x (pritor to 9.1.4691 Hotfix 40). A stack-based buffer can be overwritten when certain registration requests containing overly long hostnames are sent to vulnerable servers.  Exploits for this vulnerability have been made available via public web sites. Active exploitation of this vulnerability has been reported. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote intruder may be able to crash affected systems or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the running service which may include domain-wide administrative rights. |
