Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-1172:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Veritas Backup Exec. This occurs when processing registration requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. The application does not properly validate the length of the hostname received in registration requests, allowing a specially crafted, overly long hostname to overwrite the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the affected server.
*   **System Crash:**  Exploitation can lead to system crashes.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The executed code runs with the privileges of the Backup Exec service, which may include domain-wide administrative rights, leading to significant privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Network-Based:** The attack vector involves sending specially crafted registration requests over the network (specifically, to TCP port 6101).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Backup Exec server.
*   **Ability to Send Malicious Registration Requests:** The attacker must be able to send crafted registration requests with an overly long hostname to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Details**

*   Public exploits for this vulnerability were available, and active exploitation was reported.
*   The vulnerability affects Veritas Backup Exec 8.x (prior to 8.60.3878 Hotfix 68) and 9.x (prior to 9.1.4691 Hotfix 40).
*   Hitachi and NEC also acknowledged that their products using Veritas Backup Exec were affected by this vulnerability.
