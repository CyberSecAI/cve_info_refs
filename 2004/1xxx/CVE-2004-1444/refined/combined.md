| [Description](#c0)  Allan Graves    2004-06-10 02:14:42 UTC  ``` The net-www/roundup needs updating from 0.5.6 to the newer 0.7.4 version available.  All versions less than the 0.6.11 version have been shown to have a directory traversal security hole: <http://secunia.com/advisories/11801/>    Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-10 09:26:22 UTC  ``` Daniel/Martin --  You two are the only people who have ever touched this ebuild.  Can one of you please update it to the newest version? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-22 10:49:06 UTC  ``` Masked in package.mask due to lack of ownership. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-22 10:51:21 UTC  ``` I don't think this mask deserves a temporary GLSA. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Fernando Serboncini (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-29 11:26:00 UTC  ``` I've managed to install roundup 0.7.4 by simple copying it as roundup-0.7.4. The security issues, I think, are fixed in this version and the ebuild goes perfectly (the installation script is as simple as "python setup.py").  I think this should be updated and unmasked. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-29 11:35:37 UTC  ``` It will only be unmasked if a Gentoo dev steps up and agrees to take over maintenance of it. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Chris White (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-08 14:16:42 UTC  ``` I'm a gentoo dev, this package is mine.  I'll take care of this when I get off of work. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Chris White (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-09 00:55:13 UTC  ``` ebuild in cvs, please remove the package.mask to test. Plan is:  ppc, sparc, amd64 mark stable.  This package was marked stable on x86 through the following test case:  1) emerge =roundup-0.7.6 2) chdir to the home of a non-privileged user (in my case /home/chris) 3) mkdir roundup 4) roundup-admin install    - answered 'roundup' for the first question    - hit enter to accept the defaults for the rest 5) used the config at:    - <http://dev.gentoo.org/~chriswhite/config.py> 6) placed that in the roundup directory to replace the one there 7) roundup-admin initialise    - answered 'roundup' for the first question    - entered in an admin password 8) roundup start 8080 localhost roundup 9) pointed my browser at <http://localhost:8080/support> 10) logged in as 'admin' with my admin password set ealier 11) created a bug, attached the file at:    - <http://dev.gentoo.org/~chriswhite/roundup_test.txt>    - and commited the [bug 12](show_bug.cgi?id=12 "RESOLVED FIXED - OpenAFS fails to build")) used the Show Issue dialog and entered one for the first issue 13) resolved the issue and commited with a message 14) closed the browser 15) chdir back to the unprivleged users home dir 16) ran      - roundup stop roundup     - in that directory to kill the server and remove the .pid file 17) checked the roundup directory to make sure the .pid file was removed  end of test. Please use this same test case to stable mark the build. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Travis Tilley (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-09 09:03:39 UTC  ``` i'm not marking this stable. there isnt a current version in amd64 stable anyways, so there is no reason to bypass normal quality assurance. the same goes for ppc...  an app should be in ~arch for a while before being marked stable. it has to be tested. the only exception is when something needs to be pushed to stable for a security fix... since we have no insecure version in stable bypassing QA makes no sense. this should have been on your dev quiz, please dont CC amd64 for stuff like this in the future. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Chris White (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-09 09:06:53 UTC  ``` As per discussion with Lv, the plan will be changed to:  sparc stable x86 stable  Sorry for any trouble/confusion.  PPC removed. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Gustavo Zacarias (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-09 11:03:51 UTC  ``` Sparc stable.  ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Chris White (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-09 11:14:02 UTC  ``` Fixed the B3 error (urg).  Working on the glsa now. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-11 15:01:54 UTC  ``` glsa 200408-09.  mad props to chriswhite for resurrecting this from the dead. ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Roundup: Filesystem access vulnerability — GLSA **200408-09**

Roundup will make files owned by the user that it's running as accessable
to a remote attacker.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/roundup** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.6.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.7.6** |

### Background

Roundup is a simple to use issue-tracking system with command-line,
web, and e-mail interfaces.

### Description

Improper handling of a specially crafted URL allows access to the
server's filesystem, which could contain sensitive information.

### Impact

An attacker could view files owned by the user running Roundup. This
will never be root however, as Roundup will not run as root.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version of Roundup.

### Resolution

All Roundup users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=www-apps/roundup-0.7.6"
 # emerge ">=www-apps/roundup-0.7.6"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
