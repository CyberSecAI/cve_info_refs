The provided content describes vulnerabilities in PnTresMailer code browser 6.03, specifically related to information disclosure.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to path traversal due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the `filetohighlight` and `filetodownload` parameters in the `codebrowserpntm.php` script are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The application does not properly validate the `filetohighlight` and `filetodownload` parameters, allowing an attacker to navigate the file system and access files outside of the intended directory.
- **Information Disclosure:** The application leaks sensitive information such as source code and system files due to the path traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, such as configuration files, source code, and system files like `/etc/passwd`.
- This can lead to further attacks such as privilege escalation, gaining access to sensitive information, and potentially compromising the entire server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `codebrowserpntm.php` script, specifically manipulating the `filetohighlight` and `filetodownload` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges are required.
