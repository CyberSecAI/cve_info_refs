Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2004-1756:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how BEA WebLogic Server handles certificate chain validation when custom trust managers are in use. Specifically, if a custom trust manager rejects a certificate chain, the server might still incorrectly accept it, bypassing the intended security policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Certificate Validation:** The core weakness is the server's failure to consistently adhere to the decisions of custom trust managers. Even when a trust manager rejects a certificate chain, the server may incorrectly accept it. This indicates a logical flaw in the certificate validation process.
*   **Bypass of Custom Trust Managers:** The server does not fully respect the validation logic provided by custom trust managers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Impersonation:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to impersonate either:
    *   A user during an inbound two-way SSL request, by presenting a certificate chain that would be rejected by the trust manager, but incorrectly accepted by the server.
    *   A remote server during an outbound SSL request, by similarly presenting a flawed certificate that gets incorrectly accepted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Two-Way SSL Requests (Inbound):** Attackers can target user authentication processes that utilize two-way SSL. By manipulating the client-side certificate, an attacker can impersonate a legitimate user.
*   **Outbound SSL Requests:** Attackers can target connections made by the WebLogic Server to other remote servers. By presenting an invalid certificate, the attacker can impersonate the legitimate remote server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** Attackers must be able to establish network connections to the vulnerable WebLogic Server.
*   **SSL Communication:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the server using SSL/TLS.
*   **Malicious Certificate:** The attacker needs to craft or obtain a certificate chain that would be rejected by the custom trust manager but improperly accepted by the WebLogic Server's flawed validation.

**Affected Versions:**

*   WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express 8.1 through Service Pack 2
*   WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express 7.0 through Service Pack 4

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability specifically affects sites that use custom trust managers.
*   The provided document from cert.org contains a reference to the vendor's advisory (BEA04-054.00), which provides further details on the vulnerability.
*   The document includes fix information for Weblogic Server and Express version 8.1 and 7.0
