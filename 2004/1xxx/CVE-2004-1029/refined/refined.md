Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2004-1029:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in the Java Plugin's security framework.  Specifically, the Java Plugin fails to prevent JavaScript code from bypassing access control restrictions when attempting to access private Java packages.  These packages are intended for internal use by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and not meant to be accessed by untrusted applets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypass of Access Control:** The vulnerability allows JavaScript code to use the reflection API to access private Java packages, which should normally be restricted.
*   **Java Sandbox Escape:** By gaining access to these private packages, an attacker can potentially manipulate the Java environment, including disabling the security manager, thus escaping the Java sandbox.
*   **Reflection API Abuse:** The JavaScript reflection API is being exploited to circumvent Java's access control mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Once the sandbox is breached, a malicious applet can perform any action the user can, including reading, writing, and modifying files on the system.
*   **System Compromise:** This can lead to a complete compromise of the user's system, including the ability to upload and run programs, steal sensitive data, and potentially take full control of the machine.
*   **Cross-Platform Exploitation:** The exploit can be used on multiple OSes and architectures because Java is a cross-platform language.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attack:** The attack is initiated when a victim visits a malicious web page hosting the specially crafted Java applet.
*   **Automatic Execution:** Java Applets are normally loaded and started automatically by web browsers, requiring minimal user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a malicious website:** An attacker needs to host a web page containing the malicious Java applet and the JavaScript code that exploits the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Java Reflection API and Private Packages:** The attacker requires knowledge of how to use reflection to access restricted Java classes.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by the use of javascript code like: `var c=document.applets[0].getClass().forName('sun.text.Utility');` to access the private package `sun.text.Utility`
*  The vulnerable versions were tested on Windows and Linux, and with Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera.
*  The vulnerability was fixed in J2SE 1.4.2\_06.
