The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the Error Manager v2.1 for PhpNuke. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**1. Full Path Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** The application includes a language file based on user-supplied input (`$newlang` or `$lang`) without proper validation or sanitization.
*   **Vulnerability:** By providing a non-existent language file name (e.g., `foobar`), the `include()` function will trigger a PHP error, revealing the full server path to the `error.php` file.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of the web server's internal directory structure and the full path of the `error.php` script.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a GET request to `error.php` with a crafted `newlang` parameter (e.g., `error.php?newlang=foobar`).
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker requires the ability to make HTTP requests to the server.

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `$pagetitle` variable is used without proper initialization. If the `$error` variable doesn't match specific conditions, the `$pagetitle` variable is not set, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts using `pagetitle` or `error` parameters.
*   **Vulnerability:**  XSS vulnerability due to uninitialized `$pagetitle` and lack of input sanitization of the `error` and `pagetitle` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code via crafted URLs.
*   **Impact:**  Execution of malicious JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to cookie stealing, session hijacking, and other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Sending a GET request to `error.php` with a crafted `pagetitle` parameter (e.g., `error.php?pagetitle=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).
    *   Sending a GET request to `error.php` with a crafted `error` parameter (e.g., `error.php?error=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker requires the ability to make HTTP requests to the server.

**3. Script Injection to Error Log**

*   **Root Cause:** The Error Manager logs error details, including the referer and request URI, without sanitizing them, allowing HTML and JavaScript injection.
*   **Vulnerability:**  Injection of arbitrary HTML and Javascript code into error logs due to lack of sanitization of logged data.
*   **Impact:** When an administrator views the error log, the injected malicious code will be executed in their browser, potentially leading to account compromise by stealing cookies or creating new admin accounts by using the exploit detailed in waraxe-2004-SA#008
*  **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that submits a request to `error.php` with an embedded JavaScript payload. The attacker forces the victim to load the form and submit it to the vulnerable server.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to cause errors on the vulnerable server through the form in order to trigger the logging of the request information.
