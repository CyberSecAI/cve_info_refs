The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in NukeCalendar v1.1.a, a PHP-Nuke module. Here's a breakdown of each vulnerability:

**1. Full Path Disclosure:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application displays error messages that reveal the full server path to the PHP-Nuke installation when an invalid `eid` parameter is provided in the URL. Also, direct access to block files like `block-Calendar.php` without the intended PHP-Nuke context results in errors that expose the full path. This occurs because the renamed block file lacks the updated protection logic, and direct access reveals the path through error messages.
*   **Weakness:**  Lack of proper error handling and exposure of the full server path when errors occur. Incorrect protection code in the block files.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure, which could aid in further attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted GET requests with an invalid `eid` parameter in `modules.php`, or directly accessing the block files via a web browser.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send web requests.

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not sanitize the `eid` parameter when viewing events. User-supplied JavaScript code is injected directly into the output of the page.
*   **Weakness:** Improper input sanitization of the `eid` parameter
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing other actions within the context of the user's session.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a GET or POST request to `modules.php` with malicious JavaScript code in the `eid` parameter. POST requests are preferred due to restrictions on GET requests.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send web requests.

**3. SQL Injection:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize the `eid` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code into the database query.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization on the `eid` parameter.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially extracting sensitive data (e.g., usernames and password hashes) or modifying the database.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a GET request to `modules.php` with malicious SQL code in the `eid` parameter, specifically designed as a UNION-based SQL injection.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send web requests.
