How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Tobias Weisserth    2004-03-22 15:59:59 UTC  ``` Read the URL for details (<http://nettwerked.mg2.org/advisories/xinebug>). This got posted on bugtraq Saturday, 20/03/2004.  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: In the section of the xine-bugreport/xine-check script which assembles a bug report email, a symlink vulnerability exists due to an insecure file write of the finished bug report email template.  This may allow an attacker to write to/corrupt sensitive system files, and in theory elevate privileges, although unlikely. Actual Results:   Exploitation #############  Below is an example exploitation scenario which I actually carried out on my system.  --- attack --- [shaun@localhost shaun]$ ls -al /etc/nologin ls: /etc/nologin: No such file or directory [shaun@localhost shaun]$ ln -s /etc/nologin /tmp/xine-bugreport  [...]  [root@localhost bin]# xine-bugreport Please be patient, this script may take a while to run... logging to /tmp/xine-check.log... [OUCH!!] You're running me with root permissions?          You should definitely run xine as normal user, not root. Running it as          root will expose you to some severe security issues.          This script should run as the same user that you would use to run          xine. If you run me as root (as you currently are), I cannot check          if your real-life user has sufficient permissions...          Unless you want to recheck something with root permissions, you should          abort me now (press Ctrl-C) and run me from your usual account.          press <enter> to continue...

However, it looks like you installed xine from the RedHat packages.          So I'll just guess that you are using the standard locations.          If you want me to be sure about those file locations, you can install          the 'xine-lib-devel' package (or 'xine-devel', depend on what packages          you're using, which contains xine-config.

If your DVD-ROM device is /dev/hdb (slave ATAPI device on primary bus),          rm /dev/dvd          ln -s hdb /dev/dvd          typed as root will give you the symlink.          Alternatively, you can configure xine to use the real device directly,          using the setup dialog within xine, but I can't check your DMA          settings in that case...          press <enter> to continue...

Note, however, that there is a 40K limit on messages sent to the mailing list, So you should strip down the parts that repeat over and over, if there are any. You can either copy&paste this output from the terminal where you ran xine, or you can collect xine's output in a file named /tmp/xine.out, using this command: xine >/tmp/xine.out 2>&1 (assuming you have a Bourne compatible shell, like bash, for example) If you need to add any parameters, you can do so... This method is useful if you want to remove part of the output... Which method would you prefer? 1) copy&paste 2) logfile /tmp/xine.out please select (1..2): 2  please press <return> when you have the log ready in /tmp/xine.out  Hmmm, I could not read the /tmp/xine.out file. Skipping this step. You may add the output later, if this wasn't your intention...          press <enter> to continue...    Okay. That's all I could guide you through... I have assembled a skeleton for your bugreport in the file     /tmp/xine-bugreport  You're strongly encouraged to add a detailed description of your problem. Just look for 'additional description', and fill it in...  When you're finished, you can use your favourite mailer to send it to <xine-user@lists.sf.net>. Please use this subject line, or something similar: Subject: bug: hello world Alternatively, I could try to send the bug report for you, using /bin/mail -s "bug: hello world" Please make sure to add the additional description before saying "yes"!

# Multiple vulnerabilities in xine — GLSA **200404-20**

Several vulnerabilities have been found in xine-ui and xine-lib,
potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite files with the rights of the
user.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/xine-ui** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.9.23-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.23-r2** |

| Package | **media-libs/xine-lib** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1\_rc3-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1\_rc3-r3** |

### Background

xine is a multimedia player allowing to play back CDs, DVDs, and VCDs
and decoding multimedia files like AVI, MOV, WMV, and MP3 from local
disk drives, and displays multimedia streamed over the Internet. It is
available in Gentoo as a reusable library (xine-lib) with a standard
user interface (xine-ui).

### Description

Several vulnerabilities were found in xine-ui and xine-lib. By opening
a malicious MRL in any xine-lib based media player, an attacker can
write arbitrary content to an arbitrary file, only restricted by the
permissions of the user running the application. By opening a malicious
playlist in the xine-ui media player, an attacker can write arbitrary
content to an arbitrary file, only restricted by the permissions of the
user running xine-ui. Finally, a temporary file is created in an
insecure manner by the xine-check and xine-bugreport scripts,
potentially allowing a local attacker to use a symlink attack.

### Impact

These three vulnerabilities may alow an attacker to corrupt system
files, thus potentially leading to a Denial of Service. It is also
theoretically possible, though very unlikely, to use these
vulnerabilities to elevate the privileges of the attacker.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are advised to
upgrade to the latest available versions of xine-ui and xine-lib.

### Resolution

All users of xine-ui or another xine-based player should upgrade to the
latest stable versions:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=media-video/xine-ui-0.9.23-r2"
 # emerge ">=media-video/xine-ui-0.9.23-r2"

 # emerge -pv ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1_rc3-r3"
 # emerge ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1_rc3-r3"
```
