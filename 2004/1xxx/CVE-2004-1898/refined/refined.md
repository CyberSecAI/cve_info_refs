      "content_type": "Advisory",
      "details": "Multiple vulnerabilities were found in Monit during a simple code review. All of the vulnerabilities are in Monit's HTTP/HTTPS administration interfaces, and as such can only be exploited if the interface is enabled and accessible. Two of the vulnerabilities lie in the Basic authentication code, while one vulnerability lies in the processing of POST requests.\n\n*   **Basic Authentication Out-of-Bounds Read (Denial of Service)**\n    When faced with a Basic authentication request without a password, Monit will decrement a pointer returned by a strchr() call without appropriate NULL pointer checking. The error results in a segmentation fault during a strcpy() call. This request can be generated with a simple web browser. Specifically, if the base64-decoded credentials string does not contain a colon, the vulnerability can be exploited.\n\n*   **Basic Authentication Buffer Overflow (Remote Root)**\n    When faced with a Basic authentication request with an overly-long user name (> 256 characters), vulnerable versions of Monit will overrun a stack-based buffer. This potentially allows a remote attacker to gain root privileges.\n\n*   **POST Input Off-By-One (Exploitability Varies)**\n    When faced with a POST submission that is exactly 1,024 bytes, Monit suffers from an off-by-one overflow. Exploitability depends upon the version of gcc used to compile the application. Some compilers will allow this overflow to modify the frame pointer, potentially controlling stack frames.\n\n*  **UPDATE: Integer Overflow in POST Input Handler**\n    By specifying a Content-Length header of -1, a zero-byte heap allocation is performed. An attacker can then input an arbitrary amount of data, overwriting significant portions of the heap. This issue could also be exploited.",
    "vulnerability": "Out-of-bounds read, buffer overflow, off-by-one, integer overflow",
      "impact": "A remote attacker with access to Monit's web interface via HTTP or HTTPS clients could potentially gain the privileges of the root user, cause a denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can send malformed HTTP requests to the web interface.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the Monit web interface.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerabilities are caused by improper handling of input in Monit's HTTP/HTTPS administration interfaces."
