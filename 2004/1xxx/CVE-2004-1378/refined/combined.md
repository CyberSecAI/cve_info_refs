José Antonio Calvo discovered a bug in the Jabber 1.x server.
According to Matthias Wimmer:

> Without this patch, it is possible to remotly crash
> jabberd14, if there is access to one of the following types
> of network sockets:
>
> * Socket accepting client connections
> * Socket accepting connections from other servers
> * Socket connecting to an other Jabber server
> * Socket accepting connections from server components
> * Socket connecting to server components
>
> This is any socket on which the jabberd server parses
> XML!
>
> The problem existed in the included expat XML parser code.
> This patch removes the included expat code from jabberd14
> and links jabberd against an installed version of expat.

# jabberd 1.x: Denial of Service vulnerability — GLSA **200409-31**

The jabberd server was found to be vulnerable to a remote Denial of Service
attack.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-im/jabberd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.4.3-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.3-r4** |

### Background

Jabber is a set of streaming XML protocols enabling message, presence,
and other structured information exchange between two hosts. jabberd is
the original implementation of the Jabber protocol server.

### Description

Jose Antonio Calvo found a defect in routines handling XML parsing of
incoming data. jabberd 1.x may crash upon reception of invalid data on
any socket connection on which XML is parsed.

### Impact

A remote attacker may send a specific sequence of bytes to an open
socket to crash the jabberd server, resulting in a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All jabberd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-im/jabberd-1.4.3-r4"
 # emerge ">=net-im/jabberd-1.4.3-r4"
```
