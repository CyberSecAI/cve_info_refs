- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization when handling filenames within UMOD archives during installation. Specifically, the UMOD installer does not prevent the use of ".." sequences in filenames.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness is the insufficient validation of filenames within the manifest.ini file of a UMOD archive, allowing for directory traversal.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the partition where the game is installed. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system by overwriting critical files, like the OS kernel, or install malicious applications.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a specially crafted UMOD archive file with malicious filenames using ".." path traversal sequences. The victim would need to install this malicious UMOD file using the game's built-in installer.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious UMOD file. The attacker would need to trick the victim into installing the crafted UMOD file on their system. This requires local access to the victim machine since the user has to initiate the installation of the mod on their machine.
