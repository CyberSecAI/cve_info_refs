Zone Labs IMsecure Active Link Filter Bypass
<http://www.kurczaba.com/html/security/0410141.htm>
-------------------------------------------------

Overview:
A vulnerability has been discovered in the Zone Labs IMsecure Active Link Filter

Vendor:
Zone Labs (<http://www.zonelabs.com>)

Affected Systems/Configuration:
Versions of IMsecure and IMsecure Pro prior to 1.5

Vulnerability/Exploit:
The Active Link filter blocks potentially dangerous URLs in IM messages.
For example, IMsecure will remove URLs with extensions of .vbs, and .exe. By using \
hex encoded characters in the file extension of the URL, it is possible to bypass the \
Active Link filter.

Workaround:
Upgrade to version 1.5 or higher

Proof of Concept:
[http://www.example.com/somefile.e%78e](http://www.example.com/somefile.exe)

In the example above, "78" is hex for "x".In plain English, the URL reads:

<http://www.example.com/somefile.exe>

Date Discovered:
April 1, 2004

Fix Available:
October 12, 2004

Severity:
Low

Under some circumstances, IMsecure and IMsecure Pro may allow specifically encoded URLs to bypass Active Link filtering. As such, an IMsecure user with Active Link filtering enabled may receive an unfiltered active link.  Upgrading to the latest release of IMsecure and IMsecure Pro will resolve this issue. The latest releases of IMsecure and IMsecure Pro are versions 1.5 or newer.  **Date Published**: October 13, 2004**Date Last Revised**: October 13, 2004  **Impact**: Low risk. Users of IMsecure could receive a URL link to malicious content despite the Active Link feature being enabled. However, clicking a link in the IMsecure interface will launch the default web browser—which will also prompt the user before executing any code. This issue requires direct action by user to present any risk.  Affected Products:   * IMsecure and IMsecure Pro versions older than 1.5   Unaffected Products:   * No other Zone Labs products are affected by this issue   **Description**: Zone Labs IMsecure products contain features to filter URLs sent to the user. Users may enable or disable these features. A specially crafted URL may bypass IMsecure product filtering, thereby presenting an active URL link for the user to click on. This link could be malicious and therefore present increased risk to the end user.  This issue requires direct action by user to present any risk. In all cases, the user must click the URL link to become exposed to any malicious code. A user cannot be attacked without taking specific action to click a malicious link.  **Recommended Actions:** IMsecure and IMsecure Pro users should upgrade to version 1.5 or newer.
