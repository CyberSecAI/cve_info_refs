Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the Active Link filter of Zone Labs IMsecure. The filter blocks URLs with specific file extensions (e.g., .exe, .vbs) to prevent users from clicking on malicious links. However, the filter fails to properly handle hex-encoded characters within the file extension part of the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The Active Link filter does not properly decode or normalize URLs before checking for blocked file extensions.
- **URL Encoding Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the filter by hex-encoding characters within the file extension, effectively concealing malicious extensions (e.g., .exe) from the filter's detection mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A user could receive a malicious link via Instant Messaging that bypasses the filtering mechanism.
- If the user clicks the link, their default browser will open and potentially execute malicious code if the link leads to malicious content.
- The user is required to click the link in order to be exposed to the attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Instant Messaging (IM) messages. An attacker crafts a malicious URL with hex-encoded file extensions, sending this in a message to a victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send IM messages to the victim.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with hex-encoded characters in the file extension.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is considered low severity because user interaction is required to trigger the exploitation (clicking the link) and the browser will prompt the user before executing any code.
- Affected products are versions of IMsecure and IMsecure Pro prior to version 1.5.
- The issue was discovered on April 1, 2004 and a fix was available on October 12, 2004.

This vulnerability is a classic example of an input validation issue, which is a common class of vulnerabilities. The hex encoding bypass method can be effective in tricking simple filters that do not normalize or decode their input data.
