Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure inclusion of a PHP file (`sp-turn.php`) in `html/affich.php`. The `$base` variable, which is used to construct the path to the included file, is directly taken from user input via the URL parameter `base`. This allows an attacker to control the included file path, leading to arbitrary remote file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. The application blindly includes a file based on user-supplied input without proper validation or sanitization.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not validate or sanitize the `$base` variable, allowing any URL to be used.
- **Direct Use of User Input:** The application uses user-controlled input directly in a file inclusion function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a file from a remote server under the attacker's control, the attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the vulnerable server. This can lead to complete compromise of the server and data.
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can read sensitive information from the server's filesystem, including application configuration, user data, and other confidential information.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could potentially overload the server or cause it to malfunction.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL that sets the `base` parameter to point to a remote server controlled by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Ability to Host a Malicious PHP File:** The attacker needs to have a server under their control where they can host a malicious `sp-turn.php` file.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable software:** The attacker needs to be aware of the existence of this vulnerability to exploit it.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit example clearly demonstrates how an attacker can include a remote file.
- The solution proposed involves using `file_exists` before requiring the file, which mitigates the issue.
- The vulnerability exists in `html/affich.php` of GEMITEL v 3.50.
- The vulnerability was reported by a user named "jaguar" from wulab.com.
