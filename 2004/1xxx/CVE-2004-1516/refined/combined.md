Updated: 12-16-2004 @ 4:26 PM  The patch can be downloaded from here:  <http://phpwebsite.appstate.edu/downloads/security/phpwebsite-core-security-patch2.tar.gz> md5sum: 1b3153eed4c026289f8744f65e8b922a  This patch should only be applied to versions 0.9.3-2 or greater. All you need to do is untar the file in the base directory of your phpwebsite install.  Thanks to Maestro De-Seguridad for bringing this problem to our attention.  We will discuss the security hole in more detail after people have had a chance to apply the patch.

A remote user can conduct HTTP response splitting attacks.  Maestro reported that the 'index.php' script does not properly validate user-supplied input in several parameters. A remote user can submit a specially crafted HTTP POST request to cause the target server to return a split response. A remote user can exploit this to spoof content on the target server, attempt to poison any intermediate web caches, or conduct cross-site scripting attacks.  A demonstration exploit POST request is provided:  POST /index.php HTTP/1.0 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-length: 218 Connection: Keep-Alive  module=user&norm_user_op=login&block_username=%0d%0aContent-Length:%200%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.1%20200%20Ok%0d%0aContent-Length:%2031%0d%0aConte nt-Type:% site in 0wned</html>&password=foobar Impact:  A remote user can create a request that, when loaded by the target user, will cause arbitrary content to be displayed.  A remote user may be able to poison any intermediate web caches with arbitrary content.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
