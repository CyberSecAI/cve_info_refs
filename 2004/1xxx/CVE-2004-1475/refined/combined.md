# xine-lib: VCD MRL buffer overflow — GLSA **200408-18**

xine-lib contains an exploitable buffer overflow in the VCD handling code

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/xine-lib** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1\_rc5-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1\_rc5-r3** |

### Background

xine-lib is a multimedia library which can be utilized to create
multimedia frontends.

### Description

xine-lib contains a bug where it is possible to overflow the vcd://
input source identifier management buffer through carefully crafted
playlists.

### Impact

An attacker may construct a carefully-crafted playlist file which will
cause xine-lib to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the
user. In order to conform with the generic naming standards of most
Unix-like systems, playlists can have extensions other than .asx (the
standard xine playlist format), and made to look like another file
(MP3, AVI, or MPEG for example). If an attacker crafts a playlist with
a valid header, they can insert a VCD playlist line that can cause a
buffer overflow and possible shellcode execution.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version of xine-lib.

### Resolution

All xine-lib users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1_rc5-r3"
 # emerge ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1_rc5-r3"
```

# xine-lib: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200409-30**

xine-lib contains several vulnerabilities potentially allowing the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/xine-lib** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1\_rc5-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1\_rc6** |

### Background

xine-lib is a multimedia library which can be utilized to create
multimedia frontends.

### Description

xine-lib contains two stack-based overflows and one heap-based
overflow. In the code reading VCD disc labels, the ISO disc label is
copied into an unprotected stack buffer of fixed size. Also, there is a
buffer overflow in the code that parses subtitles and prepares them for
display (XSA-2004-4). Finally, xine-lib contains a heap-based overflow
in the DVD sub-picture decoder (XSA-2004-5).

(Please note that the VCD MRL issue mentioned in XSA-2004-4 was fixed
with GLSA 200408-18.)

### Impact

With carefully-crafted VCDs, DVDs, MPEGs or subtitles, an attacker may
cause xine-lib to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the
user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All xine-lib users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1_rc6"
 # emerge ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1_rc6"
```
