# PuTTY: Pre-authentication arbitrary code execution — GLSA **200408-04**

PuTTY contains a vulnerability allowing a SSH server to execute arbitrary
code on the connecting client.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/putty** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.54** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.55** |

### Background

PuTTY is a free implementation of Telnet and SSH for Win32 and Unix
platforms, along with an xterm terminal emulator.

### Description

PuTTY contains a vulnerability allowing a malicious server to execute
arbitrary code on the connecting client before host key verification.

### Impact

When connecting to a server using the SSH2 protocol an attacker is able
to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
PuTTY by sending specially crafted packets to the client during the
authentication process but before host key verification.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version of PuTTY.

### Resolution

All PuTTY users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=net-misc/putty-0.55"
 # emerge ">=net-misc/putty-0.55"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  PJ    2002-08-02 18:40:32 UTC  ``` Hey. This ebuild is for a collection of quotes from Douglas Adams' Hitchhikers  Guide to the Galaxy for the fortune program.  Source: <http://www.splitbrain.org/Fortunes/hitchhiker/fortune-hitchhiker.tgz> Homepage: <http://www.splitbrain.org/index.php?x=.%2FFortunes%2Fhitchhiker>  I suggest app-games/fortune-mod-hitchhiker, to go along with the current mods  which already exist. This package is dependent upon the fortune program (app- games/fortune-mod).  -PJ ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  PJ    2002-08-02 18:43:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 2764](attachment.cgi?id=2764 "fortune-mod-hitchhiker-0.1.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=2764&action=edit "fortune-mod-hitchhiker-0.1.ebuild")] fortune-mod-hitchhiker-0.1.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  José Alberto Suárez López    2002-08-09 11:44:47 UTC  ``` you forgott the LICENSE. please can find it? and post here ``` |  |

                 Vulnerabilities in PuTTY and PSCP

Date Published: 2004-08-04

Last Update: 2004-08-04

Advisory ID: CORE-2004-0705

Bugtraq ID: None currently assigned.

CVE Name: None currently assigned.

Title: Vulnerabilities in PuTTY and PSCP

Class: Boundary Error Condition

Remotely Exploitable: Yes

Locally Exploitable: No

Advisory URL:
 <http://www.coresecurity.com/common/showdoc.php?idx=417&idxseccion=10>

Vendors contacted:
- Maintainers of PuTTY
  . Core notification: 2004-07-28
  . Notification acknowledged by PuTTY maintainers: 2004-07-29
  . Fixed version (beta 0.55) released: 2004-08-03

Release Mode: FORCED RELEASE

*Vulnerability Description:*

 PuTTY is a free implementation of Telnet and SSH for Win32 and Unix
 platforms, along with an xterm terminal emulator.

 PuTTY and PSCP are client applications used by network and
 security administrators to login securily to networked server systems.

 We have found that by sending specially crafted packets to the client
 during the authentication process, an attacker is able to compromise
 and execute arbitrary code on the machine running PuTTY or PSCP.

 In SSH2, an attacker impersonating a trusted host can launch an attack
 before the client has the ability to determine the difference between
 the trusted and fake host. This attack is performed before host key
 verification.

*Vulnerable Packages:*

 PuTTY 0.54 and previous versions are vulnerable.

*Solution/Vendor Information/Workaround:*

 PuTTY 0.55 fixes these vulnerabilities. It is available at:
 <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html>

 PuTTY maintainers recommend that everybody upgrade to 0.55 as soon
 as possible.

*Credits:*

 These vulnerabilities were found by Daniel De Luca, Laura Nuñez and
 Carlos Sarraute from Core Security Technologies.

*Technical Description - Exploit/Concept Code:*

 The vulnerabilities were triggered by modifying the implementation
 of OpenSSH 3.8.1p1, specifically by modifying the following functions:
  packet_put_int
  packet_put_string
  packet_put_cstring
  packet_put_raw
  packet_put_bignum
  packet_put_bignum2
 to send specially crafted packets to the SSH client.

 [[1]](#1) Heap overflow using Bignum

 While PSCP is authenticating to the server this vulnerability can be
 triggered by sending a specially crafted big number (the "base" big
 number sent by the server).
 The vulnerability lies in the following code (from sshbn.c):
----------------------------------------------------------------------
/*
 * Compute (base ^ exp) % mod.
 * The base MUST be smaller than the modulus.
 * The most significant word of mod MUST be non-zero.
 * We assume that the result array is the same size as the mod array.
 */
Bignum modpow(Bignum base, Bignum exp, Bignum mod)
{
    BignumInt *a, *b, *n, *m;
    int mshift;
    int mlen, i, j;
    Bignum result;

    /* Allocate m of size mlen, copy mod to m */
    /* We use big endian internally */
    mlen = mod[[0]](#0);

    [...]

    /* Allocate n of size mlen, copy base to n */
    n = snewn(mlen, BignumInt);
    i = mlen - base[[0]](#0);
    for (j = 0; j < i; j++)
       n[j] = 0;
    for (j = 0; j < base[[0]](#0); j++)
       n[i + j] = base[base[[0]](#0) - j];

    [...]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 In a normal session, the base is smaller than the modulus, but no
 checks are done to ensure this. By sending a specially crafted base,
 when  i = mlen - base[[0]](#0)  is calculated, we can give  i  a controlled
 negative value, then overflow the memory allocated to n, when the
    for (j = 0; j < base[[0]](#0); j++)
       n[i + j] = base[base[[0]](#0) - j];
 loop is executed. This vulnerability can be used by an attacker to
 execute arbitrary code on the machine running PSCP.

 [[2]](#2) Another heap overflow using Bignum

 A second vulnerability can be triggered in the PuTTY client during
 the  authentication process. By modifying the second big number sent
 by the server, an attacker can make the PuTTY client crash.
 We believe this could be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary
 code on the machine running PuTTY.
