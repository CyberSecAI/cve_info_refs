The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in the Coppermine Photo Gallery for PhpNuke, as described in the security advisory waraxe-2004-SA#026, which is related to the content of CVE-2004-1986.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **A. Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Many scripts within the Coppermine package are directly accessible, and not protected. Accessing these scripts directly causes PHP error messages which then reveals the full path to the script.
    *   **Weakness:** Inadequate access controls and error handling in PHP scripts.
    *  **Impact:** Full path disclosure provides attackers with critical information about the server's file structure and the location of sensitive files which can be leveraged in further attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to vulnerable PHP scripts via HTTP requests.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** No special capabilities required; this is passively observed.

*   **B. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `menu.inc.php` script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input (`CPG_URL` parameter).
    *  **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization and output encoding.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially stealing cookies and performing unauthorized actions on behalf of users.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted URLs passed to the `menu.inc.php` script.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft and send malicious URLs to victims.

*   **C. Arbitrary Directory Browsing:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `searchnew` parameter in `modules.php` is vulnerable and can be used to browse directories on the server.
     *   **Weakness:** Inadequate input validation for the `startdir` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers, with nuke admin rights can view the directory structure, potentially revealing sensitive information and files.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the `startdir` parameter when accessing `/modules.php` with the `coppermine` module.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Needs phpNuke admin rights

*  **D. Arbitrary Shell Command Execution:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `exec()` function is used in `picmgmtbatch.inc.php` with insufficient sanitization of configuration variables such as `impath`.
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient sanitization of configuration variables used in system calls, specifically in the `exec()` function.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers with nuke admin rights, can inject arbitrary shell commands via the `impath` config variable and execute them on the server by triggering image processing.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Uploading an image to trigger image processing, after modifying the `impath` variable in Coppermine configuration using nuke admin rights.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Needs phpNuke admin rights

*   **E. Remote File Inclusion:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Vulnerable scripts include files based on user-supplied parameters (`CPG_M_DIR` and `THEME_DIR`), without proper sanitization.
     *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization and validation in file inclusion paths.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can include remote PHP scripts, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting URLs with malicious remote paths as parameters for the vulnerable scripts.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to host a malicious PHP script and craft URLs to trigger the inclusion.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Coppermine Photo Gallery 1.2.2b (new version)
*   Coppermine Photo Gallery 1.2.0 RC4 (old version)

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory emphasizes that vulnerabilities requiring admin access to PhpNuke are still significant because of other known PhpNuke vulnerabilities that could lead to takeover of a admin account, which could then be used to exploit the coppermine vulnerabilities.
*   The remote file inclusion vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary PHP code parsing and shell command injection, ultimately leading to total server compromise.
*   The advisory also mentions the possibility of obtaining a remote shell via an arbitrary port, which bypasses web server logging, and a subsequent local root exploit could lead to total server control.
