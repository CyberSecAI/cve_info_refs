Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Oracle database server when creating wrapped PL/SQL procedures. The vulnerability is triggered by placing an "overly token" within the text of a wrapped procedure created with version 9 of Oracle.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the Oracle server when creating a wrapped PL/SQL procedure.
- The "wrapped" nature of the procedure's code, intended for encryption, is not handled correctly during creation when encountering specific tokens, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Oracle user on the server, effectively taking control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the creation of a wrapped PL/SQL procedure.
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious wrapped procedure containing an overly large token, which triggers the buffer overflow when the procedure is created.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create a stored procedure (which could be a normal database user).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the Oracle database server.
- The ability to create stored procedures, implying a valid database account.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Oracle 10g and 9i databases.
- Oracle released patch #68 to fix this issue.
- NGSSQuirreL tool can be used to detect this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is related to the way wrapped procedures are created in Oracle, not just during runtime.
- The CERT document does not explicitly mention the wrapped procedure vulnerability but references Oracle Security Alert #68, which addresses this and other vulnerabilities.
