The provided content describes a vulnerability in the `mod_disk_cache` module of Apache HTTP Server versions 2.0.48, 2.0.49, and potentially earlier 2.0.x versions.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `mod_disk_cache` module stores client authentication credentials, including plaintext passwords in the case of Basic Authentication, within cached objects on disk. This occurs because the module writes all headers from the client request (`r->headers_in`) to the cache file, without filtering out sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Storage of sensitive information: The module saves client authentication credentials (including plaintext passwords when using Basic Authentication) to disk.
- Violation of RFC2616: The module stores hop-by-hop headers, such as `Proxy-Authenticate` and `Proxy-Authorization`, which should not be stored by caches, according to RFC2616.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of credentials: An attacker who gains access to the disk cache can obtain client authentication credentials, including plaintext passwords, potentially allowing them to impersonate users or access protected resources.
- Compromise of proxy authentication: Stored proxy authentication headers could be used to gain access to upstream resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- Unauthorized access to the disk cache: An attacker needs to gain access to the file system where Apache stores cached files. This could be through a system compromise, a misconfigured server, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain access to the filesystem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- File system access: The attacker needs to have read access to the disk where Apache stores cached data. This would require system-level access or a specific exploit that could grant them such access.
- Knowledge of cached data location: The attacker needs to know or be able to find the location of the Apache disk cache directory.
