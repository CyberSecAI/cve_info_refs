Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in WebCalendar:

**A. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization in various scripts. The application attempts to block `<script>` tags but fails to prevent other XSS attack vectors.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application uses a simple regular expression `preg_match ( "/<\s*script/i", $val )` to detect `<script>` tags but does not adequately filter other XSS vectors.
*   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web pages. This could lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   `<img>` tag based attacks: e.g., `<img src=... onload=javascript:alert(document.cookie)>`
    *   Event handlers within HTML tags: e.g., `<input onclick=javascript:alert(document.cookie)>`
    *   By passing the simple script tag filter with unicode encoded strings
    *   URL parameters such as `id`, `date`, `form`, `listid`, `users`, `fday`, `fmonth`, `fyear`, `user`, and `FONTS` are vulnerable
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  Ability to craft malicious URLs and/or control data submitted via HTTP GET requests.

**B. HTTP Response Splitting**

*   **Root Cause:** Poor input validation in `login.php`.
*   **Weaknesses:** The `return_path` parameter in `login.php` is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject newline characters and additional HTTP headers.
*   **Impact:** Allows the attacker to manipulate the HTTP response sent to the client. This can be used for various malicious purposes, including cache poisoning, session hijacking, or injecting malicious content.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Crafting a URL with a malicious `return_path` parameter including `%0d%0a` (carriage return and line feed characters).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft a malicious URL with the ability to control the `return_path` parameter of the `login.php` script

**C. Code Execution**

*   **Root Cause:**  Inclusion of arbitrary files via the `user_inc` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses:** The `init.php` script includes a file specified by the `user_inc` parameter without proper validation.
*   **Impact:** If an attacker can upload a malicious PHP file to the server via FTP or another method, they can execute arbitrary code on the web server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Uploading a malicious file to the web server and then crafting a URL that includes the malicious file using the `user_inc` parameter of `init.php`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to upload files to the web server via FTP or other means.

**D. Full Path Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient validation of the `encoded_login` parameter in `validate.php`.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application leaks the full server path of the `validate.php` script in its response
*   **Impact:** Exposes the full path of the script on the server's file system. This information could be used by an attacker to plan further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a HTTP GET request to `validate.php` with a malformed `encoded_login` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send a malformed HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `validate.php` script.

**E. Admin Privileges Escalation via Variable Poisoning**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper access control checks and reliance on client-side parameters to determine user privileges.
*   **Weaknesses:**  The application uses URL parameters such as `is_admin`, `is_nonuser_admin`, and `is_assistant` to determine user privileges. These parameters can be manipulated by an attacker.
*   **Impact:**  Allows an attacker to gain administrative privileges by manipulating URL parameters, bypassing access controls to gain higher permissions and access more functionality.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating URL parameters such as `is_admin`, `is_nonuser_admin`, and `is_assistant` to `true` or by manipulating other parameters such as `public_must_be_enabled` and `public_access` to gain access to administrative functionalities.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft URLs with manipulated parameters.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities**

The identified vulnerabilities highlight serious flaws in WebCalendar's security design:

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:**  The primary weakness is the inadequate filtering and sanitization of user inputs. This is prevalent in XSS, HTTP Response Splitting, and Full Path Disclosure.
*   **Lack of Access Controls:** The application incorrectly relies on client-supplied parameters to manage user privileges, as seen in the Admin Privileges escalation issue.
*   **Insecure File Handling:** The inclusion of arbitrary files via the `user_inc` parameter allows for remote code execution, which is another serious vulnerability.
*   **Poor Security Practices:** The use of a simplistic regular expression to block `<script>` tags demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic security principles.
