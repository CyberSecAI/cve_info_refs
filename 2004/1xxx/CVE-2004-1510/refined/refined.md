The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in WebCalendar, a PHP application. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**A. Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:**  Insufficient input validation. The application checks for `<script>` tags but fails to prevent other XSS attack vectors like `<img>` tags with `onload` events.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper sanitization of user inputs in various scripts like `view_entry.php`, `view_d.php`, `usersel.php`, `datesel.php`, `trailer.php`, and `styles.php`.
*  **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious HTML and JavaScript code through URL parameters. The attacker uses `<img src=` tags with `onload=javascript:alert(document.cookie)` attributes to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser. Additionally, they can inject javascript through other attributes like onclick or by injecting code inside the style tags.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs with the XSS payload. The victim needs to access this crafted URL.

**B. HTTP Response Splitting Error:**

*   **Root Cause:** Poor input validation in `login.php`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Failure to properly sanitize the `return_path` parameter, allowing the injection of newline characters (`%0d%0a`).
*   **Attack Vector:** By injecting newline characters and malicious headers into the `return_path` parameter.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can manipulate the HTTP response, potentially leading to various attacks such as cache poisoning or cross-site scripting if the manipulated response is reflected.
*  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL with a payload containing newline characters and malicious headers.

**C. Possible Code Execution:**

*  **Root Cause:**  Lack of proper file access controls and inclusion mechanisms.
*  **Weaknesses:** The application allows the inclusion of arbitrary files via the `user_inc` parameter in `init.php`.
*  **Attack Vector:** The attacker uploads a malicious PHP file to the web directory through FTP or other means, and then includes and executes that file by providing its path in the `user_inc` parameter.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the web server, as the attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server user.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the web server and craft a URL with the correct path to execute their file.

**D. Full Path Disclosure:**

*   **Root Cause:** Poor validation of the `encoded_login` parameter in `validate.php`.
*   **Weaknesses:** The script reveals the full server path when this parameter is manipulated.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted request with an invalid `encoded_login` parameter.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain information about the server's file system structure, which can be useful for further attacks.
*  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send a request to the affected script with an manipulated parameter.

**E. Admin Privileges Escalation:**

*   **Root Cause:** Vulnerability to variable poisoning in various scripts.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application relies on URL parameters for access control, which is easily manipulated. Scripts fail to properly validate the legitimacy of parameters like `is_admin`, `is_nonuser_admin`, and `is_assistant`.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates URL parameters to gain admin access.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain administrator privileges and perform unauthorized actions, potentially including adding, modifying, or deleting calendar entries.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to craft URLs with the administrative privileges parameters set to "true."

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory notes that the application uses a simple regular expression to prevent `<script>` tags. This check is easily bypassed.
*   The developers were responsive to the reported vulnerabilities and provided fixes in the CVS repository.
