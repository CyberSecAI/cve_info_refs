Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in TikiWiki 1.8.1 and earlier, as detailed in the marc.info post:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of null or non-existent values in various PHP files, revealing the server's full physical path in error messages. Lack of input validation and direct file access without proper checks.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Information leakage through error messages. Direct access to files that should not be accessed directly.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Directly calling vulnerable PHP files with crafted or missing parameters. Tampering with SQL parameters to generate errors that disclose path information.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to make web requests to the TikiWiki instance. No authentication is needed to trigger this.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in various parameters across numerous files, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Improper output encoding of user-provided data leading to execution of malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser.
    *  **Attack Vectors:** By injecting malicious javascript in parameters of various PHP files that are not properly sanitized or encoded.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to make web requests with crafted input. No authentication is needed to trigger this.

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *  **Root Cause:** Lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input for the `sort_mode` and `offset` parameters, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Unvalidated parameters in SQL queries can modify the intended query, allowing access to potentially sensitive information and potentially leading to complete control of the database.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted web requests to vulnerable PHP files, containing malicious SQL in the `sort_mode` or `offset` parameters.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** Ability to make web requests with crafted input. No authentication is needed to trigger this.

*   **Code Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Insufficient sanitization of user input in user profiles and directory entries, allowing injection of arbitrary code/scripts.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization in specific fields which can allow attackers to embed malicious code.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Inputting malicious code into user profiles (theme, country field, real name, displayed time zone) and directory entries (name, description, URL, country).
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Access to user profiles and directory entry functionalities.

*   **Remote File/Directory Enumeration via Traversal:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The map feature of TikiWiki, uses user-supplied `mapfile` parameter without proper path validation, allowing directory traversal.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Path traversal vulnerability in map feature leads to remote file/directory enumeration.
    *  **Attack Vectors:** Crafting a web request to `/tiki-map.phtml` with a `mapfile` parameter that includes directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`).
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to make web requests and knowledge about file/directory structure on the server.

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:**
    *  **Root Cause:** Lack of validation during image uploads for user profiles, allowing arbitrary files to be uploaded.
    *  **Weaknesses:**  Lack of file type restrictions allows upload of malicious files.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Uploading arbitrary files using the image upload feature in user profiles.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** User account on the TikiWiki instance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Path Disclosure:** Can reveal sensitive server information, aiding further attacks.
*   **XSS:** Allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in user's browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or further compromise.
*   **SQL Injection:** Enables attackers to read/modify the database, potentially leading to data breaches, loss of integrity, and complete system compromise.
*   **Code Injection:** Can lead to various attacks such as defacement, phishing, redirection, and arbitrary code execution.
*  **Remote File/Directory Enumeration:** Provides attackers with information about file system structure to assist in planning further attacks.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with the rights of the webserver, potentially compromising the whole server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The marc.info post emphasizes that the listed examples for each vulnerability are not exhaustive, as TikiWiki is a very large project.
*   The TikiWiki team is praised for their rapid and thorough response to these security issues.
*   The vulnerabilities affect TikiWiki versions 1.8.1 and earlier.
