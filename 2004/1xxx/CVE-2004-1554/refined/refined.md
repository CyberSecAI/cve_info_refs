```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The script `livre_include.php` includes files based on the value of the `chem_absolu` parameter without proper sanitization.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Unsanitized user-supplied input is used to construct a file path for inclusion
- Remote file inclusion (RFI) vulnerability

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, leading to the execution of malicious code on the server. This could lead to complete compromise of the web application and server.

Attack vectors:
- The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP GET request to `livre_include.php` by providing a malicious URL through the `chem_absolu` parameter.
- The `no_connect` parameter must be set to a non-empty value to reach the vulnerable code path.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to have access to a server hosting the malicious script that can be included.
