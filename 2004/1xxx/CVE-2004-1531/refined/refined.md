Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the `pid` parameter within the `index.php` file of Invision Power Board (IPB) version 2.x. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize or escape user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By injecting malicious SQL code into the `pid` parameter, an attacker can manipulate the SQL query executed by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying database. This can lead to:
    - **Data Breach:**  Retrieval of sensitive information stored in the database.
    - **Data Modification:** Modification or deletion of data, including forum content, user information, and administrative settings.
    - **Denial of Service:** Potentially disrupting the forum's functionality.
    - **Privilege Escalation:**  In some scenarios, could lead to gaining administrative access to the application and server

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `index.php` script.
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `qpid` which is part of the query string within the URL: `index.php?act=Post&CODE=02&f=2&t=1&qpid=...`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable IPB installation. No prior authentication or access to the server is required, as this is a remote vulnerability.
- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable SQL query is as follows:
  ```sql
  select p.*, t.forum_id FROM ibf_posts p LEFT JOIN ibf_topics t ON (t.tid=p.topic_id) WHERE pid IN ( ... )
  ```
- The attacker injects SQL code into the `pid` parameter, which is directly inserted into the `WHERE pid IN ( ... )` clause of the query.
- An example exploit URL is provided as: `http://site/forum/index.php?act=Post&CODE=02&f=2&t=1&qpid=1'[sql_injection]`

**Affected Versions**
The vulnerability affects IPB versions 2.0.0, 2.0.1, and 2.0.2, as identified in the provided information.
