'       Non-critacal Cross-Site Scripting bug in CuteNews            '
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

  Software: CuteNews <= 1.3.6
  Homepage: <http://www.cutephp.com>
  Author: "Exoduks" - HackGen Team
  Release Date: 2 Semptember, 2004
  Website: [www.hackgen.org](http://www.hackgen.org) [www.hackgen.tk](http://www.hackgen.tk) [www.hackgen.net](http://www.hackgen.net)
  Mail: exoduks [at] gmail . com

0x01 - Affected software description:
 -------------------------------------
 CuteNews is a very popular news publishing sistem written in php
 by CutePHP Team. The script use a flat files for storing the news
 and you don't need a mysql database. It supports comments and
 archives that can be organized by months.

 0x02 - Vulnerability Discription:
 ---------------------------------
 Vulnerability exists in index.php because there is not a checking for
 input code in mod variable , so we can inject some code into the script and
 execute injected code. I have to say that this is a non-critical bug because
 you need to have some of this privilegies for accesing the index.php.
 You need to have Adminstrator, Editor, Journalist or Commenter privilegies.
 But if you give some user with these privilegie, special design
 link you can steal his cookie and get full control of script.

 0x03 - Vulnerability Code:
 --------------------------
 Vulnerability code is in index.php from line 595 to line 511 in cutenews 1.3.6

 ----- beging the code in index.php -----

if($mod == ""){ require("./inc/main.mdu"); }

    elseif( $system_modules[$mod] )

    {

            if($system_modules[$mod] == "user"){ require("./inc/". $mod . ".mdu"); }

        elseif($system_modules[$mod] == "admin" and $member_db[1] == 1){ \
require("./inc/". $mod . ".mdu"); }

        elseif($system_modules[$mod] == "admin" and $member_db[1] != 1){ msg("error", \
"Access denied", "Only admin can access this module"); exit;}

        else{ die("Module access must be set to <b>user</b> or <b>admin</b>"); }

    }

    else{ die("$mod is NOT a valid module"); }

 ----- end of the code -----

 0x04 - How to fix this bug:
 ---------------------------
 The vendor has been conntacted 30 min ago and it will probably relese a new
 fixed version. So upgrade yours scripts to new version when it come out, or
 you can fix it with my "fix code". Fix you can find at <http://forum.hackgen.org>

 0x05 - Exploit:
 ----------------

 <http://www.host.com/cutenews/index.php?mod=>[XSS CODE]

 <http://www.host.com/cutenews/index.php?mod=&lt;script&gt;alert>(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;

 0x006 - The End:
 ----------------
 End you have come to the end of this advisor. This is my first but not last advisor.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
