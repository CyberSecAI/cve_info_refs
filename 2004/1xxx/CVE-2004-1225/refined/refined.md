    {
      "cve": "CVE-2004-1225",
      "is_relevant": true,
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation in various scripts and parameters used in SQL queries, include() or require() directives, and installation scripts.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "SQL Injection: Unsanitized input allows manipulation of SQL queries.",
          "Full Path Disclosure: Scripts reveal full paths when unexpected input is encountered.",
          "File Inclusion/Remote Command Execution: Unvalidated user input in include/require directives allows for arbitrary file disclosure and remote command execution.",
          "Insecure Installation: Install scripts are not removed/locked after installation, exposing sensitive information (MySQL password in plaintext) and allowing for denial of service attacks."
        ],
        "impact": "Attackers can bypass authentication, gain unauthorized access, retrieve sensitive data, execute arbitrary commands on the server, and perform denial-of-service attacks.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Manipulating SQL queries via HTTP GET parameters.",
          "Providing unexpected input to scripts to reveal full paths.",
          "Specifying file paths in HTTP GET parameters used in include/require directives.",
           "Accessing install scripts directly through web browser."
        ],
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires network access to the SugarSales application. Some vulnerabilities can be exploited without authentication, while others require a valid login which can be achieved through SQL injection. In the case of install script exploitation, they must have knowledge that the install directory exists and has not been removed."
