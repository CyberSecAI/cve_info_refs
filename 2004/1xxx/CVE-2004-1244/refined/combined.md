Microsoft has made available an [Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) to assist customers with the detection of needed security updates not currently supported by MBSA.

For detailed information about the programs that MBSA currently does not detect, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460)

**What is the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST)?**

As part of an ongoing commitment to provide detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft delivers a stand-alone detection tool whenever the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and the Office Detection Tool (ODT) cannot detect whether the update is required for an MSRC release cycle. This stand-alone tool is called the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST) and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a version of the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers can run the tool from a command line interface (CLI) and view the results of the XML output file. To help customers better utilize the tool, [detailed documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) will be provided with the tool. There is also a version of the tool that [SMS](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894154) customers can obtain that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.

**Can I use a version of the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. Microsoft has created a version of the EST that will determine if you need to apply this update for all of the products listed under Affected Products above. [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 984193](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) describes the EST in detail, as well as provides a download link to the tool. There is also a version of this tool that SMS customers can obtain. See the following [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 894154](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894154).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. SMS uses MBSA for detection; therefore, SMS has the same limitation listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA does not detect. Additionally, there is a version of the [EST](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894154) that SMS customers can obtain that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.
For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

The Security Update Inventory Tool is required for detecting Microsoft Windows and other affected Microsoft products. For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460)

## Vulnerability Details

#### PNG Processing Vulnerability in Windows Media Player - CAN-2004-1244:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Media Player because it does not properly handle PNG files with excessive width or height values. An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious PNG that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site or clicked a link in a malicious e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for PNG Processing Vulnerability in Windows Media Player- CAN-2004-1244:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability through media containing a reference to a malicious PNG file. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for PNG Processing Vulnerability in Windows Media Player - CAN-2004-1244:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

There are several different attack vectors that Microsoft has identified for this vulnerability. Each attack vector has a different workaround.

* **Static WMP File Extension Attack workaround**

  **Disassociate the WMP file extensions.**
  Disassociate the file extensions (.ASX, .WAX, .WVX, .WPL, .WMX, .WMS, .WMZ) in Windows to avoid previewing or opening files that point to malformed PNG files.

  Manual Steps - Windows Media Player method:

  + Launch Windows Explorer
  + On the Tools Menu select âFolder Optionsâ
  + Select the âFile Typesâ tab
  + Scroll to find the .ASX file extension and then press the âDeleteâ button
  + Repeat step 4 for each of the file extensions listed above.

  In addition, enterprise customers can configure Outlook to block the dangerous files listed using the steps documented in [Microsoft Knowledgebase Article 837388](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=837388). Use these instructions to add the documented file extensions to the Level1 block list.

  Home users can configure Outlook Express to block the dangerous files listed using the steps documented in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=291387). Use this information to configure each of the file extensions as âconfirm open after downloadâ in the Windows file types dialog.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Deleting the file associations with Media Player has a high potential for breaking corporate users who may be using Windows Media Server / Player to deliver web casts, training etc.
  Home users trying to watch streaming content on various Web sites may also be impacted by implementing this workaround.
* **Internet Explorer workaround for WMP ActiveX attack**

  **Disable the Windows Media Player ActiveX Control**. To prevent against an attack within a webpage follow these steps to disable the Windows Media Player ActiveX Control:

  Follow the instructions documented in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q240797) to killbit the following CLSIDs in Internet Explorer:

  ```
  CLSID:{6BF52A52-394A-11D3-B153-00C04F79FAA6}PROGID:WMPlayer.OCX.7
  CLSID:{22D6F312-B0F6-11D0-94AB-0080C74C7E95}PROGID:MediaPlayer.MediaPlayer.1
  CLSID:{05589FA1-C356-11CE-BF01-00AA0055595A}PROGID:AMOVIE.ActiveMovieControl.2

  ```

  **Impact of Workaround:**

  When you disable the Windows Media Player ActiveX control, pages using this control will no longer function as designed. This prevents any content from being played though the control, including audio and video.
* **Content-Type HTTP Header Attack**

  The only way to prevent this attack is to remove all of the possible MIME type entries from the registry that associate Windows Media Player with the MIME type listed in the Content-Type header being returned by the server since they all can be abused to exploit the vulnerability. Below is a list of MIME types that are associated with the WMP CLSID.

  ```
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/vnd.ms-wpl
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/x-mplayer2
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/x-ms-wmd

  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\audio/x-wav
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\midi/mid
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/avi
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/mpeg
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/mpg
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/msvideo
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-ivf
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-mpeg
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-mpeg2a
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-ms-asf
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-ms-asf-plugin
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-msvideo

  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-ms-wmp
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-ms-wmv
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-ms-wmx
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\video/x-ms-wvx

  ```

  **Impact of Workaround:**

  + These MIME type registry keys all have a CLSID value which points to the following CLSID:

    HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\CLSID\{CD3AFA8F-B84F-48F0-9393-7EDC34128127}\InprocServer32
    This CLSID is associated with WMP.DLL which is responsible for launching Windows Media Player when these MIME types are used. Un-registering WMP.DLL will break Windows Media Player.
  + The MIME types listed in this workaround are specific to Windows XP. There may be additional MIME types available on other platforms.

#### Workarounds for PNG Processing Vulnerability in MSN Messenger - CAN-2004-0597:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* Review all of the contacts currently in your contact list and remove or block any that you do not know, do not trust or no longer need.
* Do not agree to accept file transfers from contacts you do not know or trust.
* Block access to MSN Messenger and Web Messenger in a corporate environment.

  1. Block access to outgoing port 1863 in your corporate environment.
     Note MSN Messenger Service is connected through port 1863 when a direct connection is established. When a direct connection cannot be established, the MSN Messenger Service is connected through port 80.
  2. Block HTTP access to **messenger.hotmail.com**. If you would like to block access to MSN Web Messenger you will also need to block HTTP access to **webmessenger.msn.com**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** MSN Messenger clients will not be able to connect to the MSN Messenger network

#### FAQ for PNG Processing Vulnerability in MSN Messenger - CAN-2004-0597:

**Is the MSN Messenger 7.0 beta affected by this vulnerability?**

No. This vulnerability was reported prior to the release of the MSN Messenger 7.0 beta, and is therefore already incorporated into that product version.

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

MSN Messenger implements the public lipng 1.2.5 version library that is recently found to have several known vulnerabilities.

**What is PNG?**

PNG stands for Portable Network Graphics. The Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format was designed to replace the older and simpler GIF format and, to some extent, the much more complex TIFF format. Additional information about PNG can be found at the following [Web site](https://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngintro.html).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker would likely seek to exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to add them to their contacts list, and sending a specially crafted emoticon or display picture.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative credentials are given the ability to log on to servers and run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?**

Yes. Customers running an affected version of MSN Messenger should install the updated version of MSN Messenger.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by updating the library used by MSN Messenger to one that correctly validates the PNG file being passed to it.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

These vulnerabilities have been publicly released and assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CAN-2004-0597](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2004-0597) .

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Windows Media Player does not properly handle PNG images with excessive width or height values

#### Vulnerability Note VU#259890

Original Release Date: 2005-02-08 | Last Revised: 2005-02-09

---

### Overview

Microsoft Windows Media Player fails to properly handle PNG images containing unexpected information. Remote attackers may be able to craft a malicious PNG image that would cause Media Player to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| Microsoft Windows Media Player (WMP) is an application that ships with Microsoft Windows systems. It is used to play various types of media files. WMP will recognize embedded URLs in media files and launch the site specified. According to [MS05-009](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-009.mspx):  *A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Media Player because it does not properly handle PNG files with excessive width or height values. An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious PNG that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site or clicked a link in a malicious e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.* Please refer to Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-009](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-009.mspx) for more information regarding this vulnerability and its remediation. In addition, Note that this vulnerability is related to the issues described in [VU#817368](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/817368) or [VU#388984](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/388984). |
| --- |

### Impact

| If a remote attacker can persuade a user to access a malicious PNG file with Windows Media Player, that attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**  Microsoft has released Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-009](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-009.mspx) to address this issue. |
| --- |

| **Do Not Follow Unsolicited Links**In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases. |
