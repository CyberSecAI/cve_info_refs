## Cisco IOS/CatOS exposes read-write SNMP community string via traversal of View-based Access Control MIB (VACM) using read-only community string

#### Vulnerability Note VU#645400

Original Release Date: 2001-05-01 | Last Revised: 2002-03-05

---

### Overview

There is a vulnerability that permits unauthorized access to several switch and router products manufactured by Cisco Systems. An attacker who gains access to an affected device can read and modify its configuration, creating a denial-of-service condition, an information leak, or both.

### Description

| Certain versions of the Cisco Internetworking Operating System (IOS) and Catalyst Operating System (CatOS) contain a default configuration that allows a read-only Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) community string to expose a read-write community string. The exposure occurs in the View-based Access Control (VACM) MIB, which is a Management Information Base module that allows system administrators to configure access policies for SNMP-managed devices. Once exposed, the read-write community string grants an attacker complete access to affected devices, allowing them to gather information, monitor network traffic, and alter or disrupt network operation. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability allows attackers to read and modify any SNMP objects present on an affected device. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability can re-route or disrupt network traffic as well as gather information about network topology and system administration contacts. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Cisco has released an advisory that provides a list of affected products, along with instructions for obtaining fixed software. Because there are many possible combinations of hardware and software configurations, the CERT/CC recommends that all users of IOS and CatOS software consult the following Cisco Security Advisory:   <http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/ios-snmp-community-vulns-pub.shtml> |
| --- |

| Cisco has provided detailed information on implementing workarounds to address this issue. Please consult the Cisco advisory referenced above. |
