  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "A default configuration in certain versions of Cisco IOS and CatOS allows a read-only SNMP community string to expose a read-write community string through the View-based Access Control (VACM) MIB.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure default configuration",
        "Exposure of read-write SNMP community string via read-only string"

This includes gathering information, monitoring network traffic, and altering or disrupting network operation, leading to denial-of-service, information leaks, or both.",

        "Exploitation of SNMP protocol",
