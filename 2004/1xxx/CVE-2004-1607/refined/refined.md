Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in Sage SalesLogix:

**1. Web Client: Authentication Bypass**

*   **Root Cause:** The web client relies solely on a cookie for authentication, without proper session tracking or password verification.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of session management, trusting client-supplied data, insecure authentication.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can impersonate any user, including the administrator, gaining full access to the system.
*  **Attack vector:** By crafting a malicious cookie.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to intercept and modify HTTP headers, basic understanding of web requests.

**2. Web Client: Information Disclosure in HTTP Headers**

*   **Root Cause:** The application leaks detailed error messages including stack traces and memory locations in HTTP headers upon crashing.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient error handling, information leakage through HTTP headers.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gather information about the system, which could aid in further exploitation.
*   **Attack vector:** By sending invalid requests to trigger an application crash.
*  **Required Capabilities:** Basic understanding of HTTP requests.

**3. Web Client: Document Store Directory Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:**  The application reveals the full paths to the Library and Attachment directories when an invalid filename is requested.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient input validation, information leakage by revealing file paths in error messages.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the file system structure.
*   **Attack vector:** By submitting a request with invalid file parameter values.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Basic understanding of web requests.

**4. Web Client: SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:**  The application constructs SQL queries using unsanitized user-provided input.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization, SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breach, modification, or complete control of the database server.
*   **Attack vector:** By injecting malicious SQL code through URL parameters.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Knowledge of SQL injection techniques, basic understanding of web requests.

**5. Web Client: Passwords are Revealed in Source Code**

*   **Root Cause:** The application includes sensitive data such as database credentials (username, password) within the VBScript code of the web page.
*   **Weakness:** Hardcoding sensitive data within client-side scripts.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can obtain database credentials, and other sensitive information, enabling direct access to the database.
*   **Attack vector:** By viewing the HTML source code of a web page or by intercepting web traffic.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Basic understanding of web requests, ability to view HTML source code.

**6.  SLX: Client / server authentication weaknesses**

*   **Root Cause:** The SLX client-server communication protocol does not require client authentication before executing commands.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of server-side authentication enforcement in the protocol.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can impersonate a server, execute arbitrary commands on the server, or perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
*   **Attack vector:** Network interception and manipulation.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Network manipulation capabilities (e.g., ARP spoofing), understanding of network protocols.

**7. SLX: Server reveals database username and password**

*   **Root Cause:** The server discloses database credentials when requested using the `GetConnection` command on port 1707 without prior authentication.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of authentication before providing access to database credentials
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain full access to the database, including read/write permissions, and potential privilege escalation.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a specific command to the server over the network (TCP port 1707).
*   **Required Capabilities:**  Network connectivity to the server, ability to craft network packets, basic understanding of the protocol.

**8. SLX: Arbitrary files can be created on the SalesLogix server**

*  **Root Cause:** The `ProcessQueueFile` command on the SLX server allows for arbitrary file uploads without proper validation combined with directory traversal vulnerabilities.
*  **Weakness:**  Lack of directory traversal and input validation when handling file uploads.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can create, truncate, or overwrite arbitrary files on the server's filesystem.
*  **Attack vector:** Utilizing the `ProcessQueueFile` command with a crafted file path, and content.
*  **Required Capabilities:**  Network connectivity to the server, ability to craft network packets, knowledge of the protocol.

**Additional Notes**
* The advisory notes that the vendor has released patches to address these vulnerabilities, but the author has not verified them.
* The advisory includes a proof-of-concept Perl exploit for the arbitrary file creation vulnerability.
* The vendor, Sage, was notified of the vulnerabilities, which were discovered on May 19, 2004. The advisory was released on October 18, 2004.
