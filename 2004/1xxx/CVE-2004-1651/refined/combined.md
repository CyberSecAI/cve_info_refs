              Multiple Vulnerabilities in phpScheduleIt

Affected software description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

phpScheduleIt 1.0.0 RC1

phpScheduleIt is a web application that attempts
to solve the problem of
scheduling and managing resource utilization. It
provides a permissions-based
calendar that allows users to self-register and
reserve resources and the
tools to manage those reservations.

Some typical applications are conference room,
equipment, or work shift scheduling.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vulnerabilities:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A. Multiple Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities

A1. When you register a new user the fields
"Name" and "Last Name" (at least)
allows potentially dangerous HTML (and also
any Client-side scripting language).

If do you want to try it follow these steps :

       1.- Go to http://<site-with-phpScheduleIt>
       2.- Click on "Click Here to Register"
       3.- Enter the required fields and in the name
and/or last name insert the
           following data :

               a&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;

       4.- Click on register. The system doesn't
check if the e-mail is valid and/or
           if this is a robot! You are logged in!!!
       5.- You will see your cookie in a box.

Exploitation of this issue could allow for theft of
cookie-based authentication
credentials. Other attacks are also possible.

A2. When you create a new Schedule you can
insert potentially dangerous HTML or Client
side script in the Schedule Name field.

Exploitation of this issue could allow for theft of
cookie-based authentication credentials.
Other attacks are also possible.

B. Privilege Excalation Vulnerabilities

B1. Privilege excalation (Administrator
privileges) of a normal user.

The best way to test it is by follow these steps :

       1.- Goto http://<site-with-phpScheduleIt>
       2.- Logging as administrator.
       3.- Now, insert in the browser the following
location http://<site-with-phpScheduleIt> or
       	   just click on the Back button in your
browser.
       4.- Logging as a normal user.
       5.- The user is a normal user with the Admin
user privileges.

This doesn't work if the Administrator does click
on "Logout".

NOTE: This requires that the user be on the
same machine and browser as the
administrator and is really more of a physical
security issue than a
programatic risk.

The fix:
~~~~~~~~

The security issues have been fixed and will be
included in the codebase
starting with version 1.0.0.
