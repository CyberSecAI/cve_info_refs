The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in phpScheduleIt 1.0.0 RC1.

**A. Multiple Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities**

*   **A1:**
    *   **Root cause:** Insufficient input validation in the "Name" and "Last Name" fields during user registration.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Allows injection of arbitrary HTML and client-side scripting code.
    *   **Impact:**  Cookie-based authentication credentials theft, and other potential attacks via injected scripts.
    *   **Attack vector:** User registration form.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to register a new user.
*   **A2:**
    *   **Root cause:** Insufficient input validation in the "Schedule Name" field during schedule creation.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Allows injection of arbitrary HTML and client-side scripting code.
    *   **Impact:** Cookie-based authentication credentials theft, and other potential attacks via injected scripts.
    *   **Attack vector:** Schedule creation form.
    *    **Required attacker capabilities:** Authenticated user capable of creating a new schedule.

**B. Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities**

*   **B1:**
    *   **Root cause:** Improper handling of session data or caching, allowing a normal user to inherit administrator privileges.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Insecure session management.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to administrative functions, user privilege escalation.
    *   **Attack vector:** Browsing history (back button) and concurrent sessions from the same browser.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Requires an administrator to have logged into the application on the same browser and not properly logged out and an attacker logs in from the same browser as a normal user.
    *  **Note**: The advisory does note that this is more of a physical security issue and programatic risk, since it requires the user to be on the same machine and browser.

The advisory states that these issues have been fixed in version 1.0.0.
