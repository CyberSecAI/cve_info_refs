User Interface
▾

Bugzilla :: User Interface
General issues having to do with the user interface. This includes both presentation (how it looks) and behavior (how it works) but not functionality (what it does), which should be filed in a function-specific component like Email Notifications or in Bugzilla-General. Examples of bugs you might file here include column label "Pri" is confusing and take anonymous users to the simple query page by default but not need way to filter for requests with no requestee.
As a general rule, bugs that affect only a single Bugzilla web page or can be fixed with changes just to templates probably go in this component, while bugs that affect multiple pages or fixes to Perl code probably go somewhere else.

This needs to be fixed in show\_bug.cgi by removing fields from displayfields and
then in the template by checking for private on longdescs and attachments

Hmm. Is it perhaps instead the right solution to check permissions inside the
CGI and not even make the data available to templates if they shouldn't display it?
That would mean, in terms of comments, that we'd need to pass comment numbers
along with the data, as they wouldn't necessarily be contiguous any more.

Yes. I was just thinking that before I even read Gerv's comment. Especially
with customizing templates making it so darn easy for an admin (or even a
developer, as in this case) to shoot themselves in the foot. The CGIs already
decide who can see a secured bug before it even gets displayed. Bug.pm and
Attachment.pm should do the same with secure fields inside the bug as well.
On that note, however, I'm willing to let a filter fix go in as a security fix
as long as we have a new bug filed to handle the back-end data filtering which
someone plans to actually work on.

The more comprehensive fix probably needs to do the following....
1) GetComments needs to move to Comment.pm (??)
2) Bug.pm, Search.pm, Comment.pm(?), and Attachment.pm all need to be aware of
these restrictions and only return information for the current user UNLESS they
are passed another user object.

Filter out private fields
Make sure this gets flagged as a security patch (blatently) in the commit
message when it gets checked in. The localizers need to make sure to fix this
in their templates as well, so we need to make sure it stands out in the bonsai
query they run to see what's changed in the templates.

/me goes and adds this one to it, this is more serious than the other two.

Do we have a bug for this yet?
The fact that this will affect localizers that already have 2.18 templates done
is a big reason why this needs to be done on the back-end instead, long-term.Flags: blocking2.20?Flags: blocking2.20+Flags: blocking2.18?Flags: blocking2.18+

Bugzilla Security Advisory
October 24, 2004

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.

This advisory covers three security bugs that have recently been
discovered and fixed in the Bugzilla code: In the stable 2.16 releases,
it is possible to make a specific change to a bug without permissions;
and in the 2.18 release candidate, there are information leaks with
private attachments and comments.  We are not aware of any occasions
where any of these vulnerabilities have been exploited.

All Bugzilla installations are advised to upgrade to the latest stable
version of Bugzilla, 2.16.7, or to the current 2.18 release candidates,
2.18rc3, which were released today.

Development snapshots and version 2.18 release candidates prior to
version 2.18rc3 are also affected, so if you are using a development
snapshot or 2.18 release candidate, you should obtain a newer one
(2.18rc3) or use CVS to update.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Issue 1
- -------
Class:       Unauthorized Bug Change
Versions:    2.9 through 2.18rc2 and 2.19(from cvs)
Description: It is possible to send a carefully crafted HTTP POST
~             message to process_bug.cgi which will remove keywords from
~             a bug even if you don't have permissions to edit all bug
~             fields (the "editbugs" permission).  Such changes are
~             reported in "bug changed" email notifications, so they are
~             easily detected and reversed if someone abuses it.
Reference:   <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=252638>

Issue 2
- -------
Class:       Information Leak
Versions:    2.17.1 through 2.18rc2 and 2.19(from cvs) (2.16-based
~             releases and earlier are not affected)
Description: Exporting a bug to XML exposes user comments and attachment
~             summaries which are marked as private to users who are not
~             members of the group allowed to see private comments and
~             attachments.  XML export is not exposed in the user
~             interface, but is available to anyone who knows the correct
~             URL to invoke it.  This only affects sites that use the
~             'insidergroup' feature.
Reference:   <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=263780>

Issue 3
- -------
Class:       Information Leak
Versions:    2.17.1 through 2.18rc2 and 2.19(from cvs) (2.16-based
~             releases and earlier are not affected)
Description: Changes to the metadata (filename, description, mime type,
~             review flags) on attachments which were flagged as private
~             get displayed to users who are not members of the group
~             allowed to see private attachments when viewing the bug
~             activity log and when receiving bug change notification
~             mails.  This only affects sites that use the 'insidergroup'
~             feature.

Vulnerability Solutions
=======================

The fixes for all of the security bugs mentioned in this advisory are
included in the 2.16.7 and 2.18rc3 releases, and in the 2.19.1
development snapshot.  Upgrading to these releases will protect
installations from possible exploits of these issues.

Full release downloads, patches to upgrade Bugzilla to 2.16.7 from
previous 2.16.x versions, and CVS upgrade instructions are available at:
~  <http://www.bugzilla.org/download/>

Specific patches for each of the individual issues can be found on the
corresponding bug reports for each issue, at the URL given in the
reference for that issue in the list above.
