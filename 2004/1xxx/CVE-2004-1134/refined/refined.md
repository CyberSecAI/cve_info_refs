**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer overflow: The ISAPI extension fails to properly validate the length of input parameters, leading to a buffer overflow when a long string is supplied.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: The buffer overflow can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a long string as a parameter in the URL, specifically when calling `w3who.dll` via an HTTP GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable `w3who.dll` file. No authentication or prior access to the server is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to send a specially crafted request with an overly long parameter to cause the buffer overflow.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in `w3who.dll`, an ISAPI extension included in the Windows 2000/XP Resource Kit.
- The vulnerable code is no longer available from the vendor's website.
- The advisory mentions that a Metasploit plugin and Nessus script have been developed to exploit or detect the vulnerability, respectively.
