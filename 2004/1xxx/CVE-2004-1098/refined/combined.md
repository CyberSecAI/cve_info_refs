It does *not* break SOAP-Lite-60a-r1. There was a mistake in the ebuild which I corrected this morning and retested. SOAP-Lite-60a-r1 works fine with 5.413 and up, including 5.415. If you can pass me some code that doesn't work I'd be happy to test it out. The tests will fail with the flush because of a flaw in the tests themselves, not SOAP-Lite/MIME-tools interaction. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Simon Stelling (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-02 04:08:03 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-02 10:25:36 UTC  ``` GLSA 200411-06 ``` |  |

# MIME-tools: Virus detection evasion — GLSA **200411-06**

MIME-tools doesn't handle empty MIME boundaries correctly. This may prevent
some virus-scanning programs which use MIME-tools from detecting certain
viruses.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-perl/MIME-tools** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.415** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.415** |

### Background

MIME-tools is a Perl module containing functions to handle MIME
attachments.

### Description

MIME-tools doesn't correctly parse attachment boundaries with an empty
name (boundary="").

### Impact

An attacker could send a carefully crafted email and evade detection on
some email virus-scanning programs using MIME-tools for attachment
decoding.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MIME-tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-perl/MIME-tools-5.415"
```
