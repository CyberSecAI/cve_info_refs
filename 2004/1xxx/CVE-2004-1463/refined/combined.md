# MoinMoin: Group ACL bypass — GLSA **200408-25**

MoinMoin contains a bug allowing anonymous users to bypass ACLs (Access
Control Lists) and carry out operations that should be limited to
authorized users.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/moinmoin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.3** |

### Background

MoinMoin is a Python clone of WikiWiki, based on PikiPiki.

### Description

MoinMoin contains two unspecified bugs, one allowing anonymous users
elevated access when not using ACLs, and the other in the ACL handling
in the PageEditor.

### Impact

Restrictions on anonymous users were not properly enforced. This could
lead to unauthorized users gaining administrative access to functions
such as "revert" and "delete". Sites are vulnerable whether or not they
are using ACLs.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround.

### Resolution

All users should upgrade to the latest available version of MoinMoin,
as follows:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=www-apps/moinmoin-1.2.3"
 # emerge ">=www-apps/moinmoin-1.2.3"
```
