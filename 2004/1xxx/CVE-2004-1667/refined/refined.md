Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-1667:

*   **Vulnerability:** Off-by-one error
*   **Affected Software:** Halo: Combat Evolved versions 1.04 and earlier.
*   **Platforms:** Windows and MacOS
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability occurs during the client's response in the Gamespy SDK handshake algorithm. Specifically, when the client sends a response larger than 32 bytes, it causes the server to crash. The game converts the encryption hash received from the client to a hex string using a 32-byte buffer. A NULL terminator is added at the end of the buffer, overwriting a byte of the canary value used by the exception handler, leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote, targeting the server.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The server crashes when it receives a crafted client response exceeding 32 bytes.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to send a specially crafted network packet to the Halo server.
*   **Fix:** Patch 1.05 for both Win32 and MacOS.
*   **Additional detail:** The encryption hash used by Halo for encrypting its packets is usually composed of 0 bytes at the beginning, meaning only the last 2 or 3 bytes are non-zero. The hex conversion is only done if the first byte of the hash isn't zero. This explains why normal connections aren't affected.
