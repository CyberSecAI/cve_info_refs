Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2004-1916:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause lies in insufficient input validation within the LCDproc server (LCDd), specifically when handling client-supplied data. This lack of validation leads to buffer overflows and a format string vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Buffer Overflow in `parse_all_client_messages()`:**
    *   A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `parse_all_client_messages()` function within `parse.c`.
    *   The `errmsg` buffer is overflowed when an invalid, long command is sent to the server.
    *   This allows an attacker to overwrite the return address on the stack, gaining control of the `eip` register.
2.  **Buffer Overflow in `test_func_func()`:**
    *   A buffer overflow is present in the `test_func_func()` function located in `client_functions.c`.
    *   By sending a large number of arguments (long `argv`) with the `test_func` command to the server, the `str` buffer gets overflowed.
3.  **Format String Vulnerability in `test_func_func()`:**
    *   The `printf(str)` statement within the `test_func_func()` function is vulnerable to a format string attack because it directly prints the user controlled `str` buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the LCDproc server, typically the "nobody" user.
*   This could lead to complete system compromise if LCDd runs under a privileged account, although this is not the default.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   These are remote vulnerabilities.
*   Attackers can exploit these flaws by sending crafted network requests to the LCDd server.
*   Specifically, the attacker needs to send a long, invalid command to trigger the overflow in `parse_all_client_messages()`, or a large number of arguments with the `test_func` command to trigger the overflows and format string issues in `test_func_func()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network connectivity to the target running the vulnerable LCDd server.
*   The attacker does not require prior authentication.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the LCDd server.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Priv8 Security Research.
*   The advisory includes proof-of-concept code, and a patch to fix the issues, available at `http://www.priv8security.com/releases/lcdproc/`.
*   The gentoo security advisory states the vulnerable versions are <= 0.4.4-r1, and the issue is fixed in version >=0.4.5.
