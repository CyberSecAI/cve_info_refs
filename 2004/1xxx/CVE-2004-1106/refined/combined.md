Package        : gallery
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-1106
BugTraq ID     : 11602

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in gallery, a web-based
photo album written in PHP4.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CAN-2004-1106

    Jim Paris discovered a cross site scripting vulnerability which
    allows code to be inserted by using specially formed URLs.

CVE-NOMATCH

    The upstream developers of gallery have fixed several cases of
    possible variable injection that could trick gallery to unintended
    actions, e.g. leaking database passwords.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.5-8woody3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4-pl4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your gallery package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 alias woody

The primary problem is a cross site  scripting vulnerability which allows code to be inserted into a Gallery  by using specially formed URLs. This code then appears to be part of the  Gallery.  No risk is posed to the webserver-itself or any non-Gallery data, but a  Gallery install could be compromised using appropriate code.  All Gallery users are very strongly urged to upgrade to 1.4.4-pl3  immediately, which fixes this serious problem and will secure your system. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Luke Macken (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-02 16:48:59 UTC  ``` web-apps,  please bump to 1.4.4-pl3. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tom Hosiawa    2004-11-02 17:53:21 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 43201](attachment.cgi?id=43201 "gallery-1.4.4_p3.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=43201&action=edit "gallery-1.4.4_p3.ebuild")] gallery-1.4.4_p3.ebuild  This is based on the ebuild I did for 2.0_alpha3.
