<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
December 24th, 2004                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : tiff
Vulnerability  : insufficient input validation
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-1308

"infamous41md" discovered a problem in libtiff, the Tag Image File
Format library for processing TIFF graphics files.  Upon reading a
TIFF file it is possible to allocate a zero sized buffer and write to
it which would lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.5-6woody2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.1-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your libtiff packages immediately.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

## LibTIFF vulnerable to integer overflow via corrupted directory entry count

#### Vulnerability Note VU#125598

Original Release Date: 2005-01-11 | Last Revised: 2005-05-12

---

### Overview

An integer overflow in LibTIFF may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| LibTIFF is a library used to encode and decode images in [Tag Image File Format (TIFF)](http://www.libtiff.org/). A lack of validation on user supplied input may allow buffer overflow to occur. TIFF files contain directory entry header fields to describe the data in the file. If a remote attacker creates a TIFF file with specially crafted directory headers and persuades a user to access that file, an integer overflow will occur that may eventually lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. |
| --- |

### Impact

| If a remote attacker can persuade a user to access a specially crafted TIFF image, that attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of that user. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or Patch**  This issue has been corrected in LibTIFF version 3.7.1. Obtain a patch or upgraded software from your vendor. Recompile statically linked applications. |
| --- |

| **Do Not Accept TIFF Files from Unknown or Untrusted Sources**  Exploitation occurs by accessing a specially crafted TIFF file (typically .tiff or .tif extension). By only accessing TIFF files from trusted or known sources, the chances of exploitation are reduced. |

Notified:  January 11, 2005  Updated: January 13, 2005

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

NetBSD does not include libtiff in the Operating System release.

It is available as a third-party package in the pkgsrc system, and was updated to 3.7.1 when the release first became public. A number of graphical programs and desktop environments in pkgsrc depend on libtiff, and so it may well have been installed as part of building another package.

Known vulnerabilities in third-party pkgsrc packages are published in the pkg-vulnerabilities database. NetBSD recommends that users check installed packages against this database regularly using the tools in the security/audit-packages package.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
