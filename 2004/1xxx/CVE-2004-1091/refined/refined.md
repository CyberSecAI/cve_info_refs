Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-1091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference within the `mc` (Midnight Commander) software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code attempts to access memory via a pointer that is NULL, which leads to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Exploitation of this vulnerability will cause the application to crash, rendering it unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The specific attack vector isn't detailed in the provided text, but the vulnerability can be triggered remotely, meaning it's likely triggered by a specific input or action within `mc` that causes the program to attempt to dereference a null pointer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to manipulate input to the `mc` application in a way that triggers the null dereference. This likely involves crafting specific files or commands that the `mc` application processes.
- No specific system privileges are mentioned. This is a DoS, not a privilege escalation.
