=====================
Vulnerability Details
=====================

1) AUTHENTICATION CIRCUMVENTION
===============================

DESCRIPTION:

LINBOX has a webbased administration portal on port 8080 that is accessible
through the internet by default. Opening this page in a browser gives the
user the following options:

- Administration
- Webmail
- Personal Settings

Hitting the link "Administration", the web application requests username and
password. The authentication mechanisms seems to be provided by a AuthMySQL
3.1 Apache module.

However because of a configuration fault, it is possible for an attacker to
bypass the authentication by opening the page //admin/user.pl (note the double
slash at the beginning), which gets the attacker to a list of users. Once on
that page, an attacker could as well just add a user of it's own (with
administration priviledges) and log in comfortably at the front page.

EXAMPLE:

---*---
Http-Request:
<http://demo.linbox.at//admin/user.pl>

---*---

REMARKS:

As soon as the attacker has an administrativ account, he can:
- Create/delete/change usrs
- Create/delete/change VPN accounts
- Change the network configuration (IP, default GW, etc.)
- Create/delete/change Samba shares as well as their permissions
- Shut the system down
- Deactivate the virus scanner

2) PASSWORD DISCLOSURE FOR ALL EXISTING USERS
=============================================

DESCRIPTION:

As soon as the attacker as access to the users.pl page (as described in 1),
he can read all passwords of all existing users by simply hitting the edit
button for each user. This page contains the password in an HTML password
input box, which the attacker can read in cleartext by viewing the source
code of the HTML page.

EXAMPLE:

<tr><td class="ADMIN-LEFT">Password:</td><td class="ADMIN-RIGHT"
colspan="1"><input type="password" name="adm_Password" value="dieter" />
***-----------------------------------------------------------^^^^^^
 </td></tr>
<tr><td class="ADMIN-LEFT">Passwortbestätigung:</td><td class="ADMIN-RIGHT"
colspan="1"><input type="password" name="adm_Passwortbestätigung"
value="dieter" /> </td></tr>
***----^^^^^^

3) SYSTEM LOGIN THROUGH SSH
===========================

DESCRIPTION:

As all user accounts on the administrative portal are also system accounts,
an attacker can use a ssh-shell (if available) to login to the system with
the passwords provided in 2).

===============
GENERAL REMARKS
===============

Above findings derive from an external (black box) security test.
we would like to apologize in advance for potential nonconformities and/or
known issues.
