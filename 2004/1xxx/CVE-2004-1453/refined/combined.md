| [Description](#c0)  Brandon Hale (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-05 08:10:19 UTC  ``` There is an issue in Glibc where LD_DEBUG is allowed on suid binaries when it should not be. Patch is applied to glibc-2.3.4.20040619-r1, KEYWORDS="-* ~x86 ~mips ~amd64 ~hppa" ${FILESDIR}/glibc-sec-hotfix-20040804.patch  The patch conflicts with owl-malloc patch in some glibcs, so they are both rolled into the patch. Remove owl-malloc if adding to another glibc.  Arch folks please fix your current glibc or test + keyword a patched version. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2004-08-05 08:26:03 UTC  ``` hotfix applies cleanly to 2.3.2-r10  we'll also have to touch up the patch to apply cleanly to 2.2.5 (it just needs a few cosmetic touchups) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2004-08-05 08:29:34 UTC  ``` all glibc's in portage atm (except for glibc-2.3.4.20040619-r1) need to get updated and/or pruned  arch maintainers: we'll add the patch and then post the versions that'll need to get marked stable / unstable ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2004-08-05 10:23:51 UTC  ``` glibc-2.3.2-r11 is in portage ... these arches are eligible for moving to stable: x86 ppc sparc mips alpha arm hppa amd64 ia64 s390  this should be pretty painless since the only changes between the previous stables (glibc-2.3.2-r{9,10}) consists of: - ebuild clean up (moving flag mangling functions out of global scope) - no longer stripping libpthread or libthread_db - this security patch ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tom Martin (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-05 11:54:57 UTC  ``` Stable on amd64. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Travis Tilley (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-06 03:12:06 UTC  ``` slarti - we dont even use 2.3.2 on amd64... glibc-2.3.4.20040619-r1 has the hotfix and that's what we use.  ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-07 03:29:00 UTC  ``` For stable profiles, here is what the arches currently use and should try to mark stable.

For them, a patched 2.3.3 should be produced, or maybe they can directly go for the 2.3.4.20040619-r1 : mips (2.3.3.20040420) x86 (2.3.3.20040420)   This arch uses a 2.3.4.

# glibc: Information leak with LD\_DEBUG — GLSA **200408-16**

glibc contains an information leak vulnerability allowing the debugging of
SUID binaries.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-libs/glibc** on the alpha arm hppa ia64 sparc s390 architecture |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.3.2-r10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.3.2-r11** |

| Package | **sys-libs/glibc** on the x86 ppc architecture |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.3.3.20040420** |

| Package | **sys-libs/glibc** on the mips architecture |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.3.3.20040420** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.3.4.20040619-r1** |

| Package | **sys-libs/glibc** on the amd64 architecture |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.3.4.20040619** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.3.4.20040619-r1** |

| Package | **sys-libs/glibc** on the ppc64 architecture |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.3.4.20040605** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.3.4.20040808** |

### Background

The GNU C library defines various Unix-like "system calls" and other
basic facilities needed for a standard POSIX-like application to
operate.

### Description

Silvio Cesare discovered a potential information leak in glibc. It
allows LD\_DEBUG on SUID binaries where it should not be allowed. This
has various security implications, which may be used to gain
confidentional information.

### Impact

An attacker can gain the list of symbols a SUID application uses and
their locations and can then use a trojaned library taking precendence
over those symbols to gain information or perform further exploitation.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version of glibc.

### Resolution

All glibc users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv your_version
 # emerge your_version
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
