Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the potential vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The iwebnegar software, a Farsi weblog application written in PHP, is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where untrusted user input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This is present in multiple files, such as `comments.php`, `index.php` and the administrator login page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can manipulate database queries using SQL injection to bypass security checks, access unauthorized information, modify data, or potentially gain control of the database server or the application.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **URL Parameter Injection:** The provided example shows that the `string` parameter in `index.php` is vulnerable. Specifically, the attacker can inject SQL code through the `string` parameter in the URL `http://site/weblog/index.php?string=[sql injection code]`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application. No specific privileges are required.
