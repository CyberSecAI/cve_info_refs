Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:**

*   The LCDproc server (LCDd) has insufficient input validation of client-supplied data. Specifically, it lacks proper bounds checking when handling client commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow (Problem 1):** In the `parse_all_client_messages()` function within `parse.c`, a long, invalid command sent by a client can overflow the `errmsg` buffer, leading to potential arbitrary code execution. The code includes a comment "// FIXME: Check for buffer overflows here..." indicating a known issue that was not addressed
*   **Buffer Overflow (Problem 2):** The `test_func_func()` function in `client_functions.c` is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing a long list of arguments. Specifically, the `str` buffer is overflowed in the loop where it's being populated with the arguments (`argv`).
*   **Format String Vulnerability (Problem 3):** The same `test_func_func()` function has a format string vulnerability in the `printf(str);` call, which can be exploited if the contents of the `str` buffer contain format string specifiers (e.g., %x, %s, %n) due to the previous buffer overflow vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the LCDproc server (LCDd). By default, this is often the 'nobody' user, but it could have higher privileges if configured differently.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable if the LCDd server is configured to listen on all network interfaces. This is usually done via the "Bind" parameter in the LCDproc configuration file.
*   **Network-based:** An attacker would need to send crafted messages to the LCDd server via the network to trigger these vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the machine running the vulnerable LCDd server.
*   **Knowledge of the Protocol:** The attacker needs to know how to interact with the LCDd server to send specific commands that trigger the vulnerabilities (e.g., sending a long invalid command for buffer overflow 1, sending many long arguments to the test_func command to exploit overflow and format string).
*   **Ability to craft packets:** The attacker needs to send malformed commands designed to cause the buffer overflows.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions a proof-of-concept exploit `priv8lcd.pl` and a patch are available from the Priv8 Security Research website.
*   The advisory also notes that the `parse_all_client_messages()` function has a FIXME comment related to buffer overflow checks, which were not properly implemented.
*   The gentoo advisory mentions upgrading to version 0.4.5, while Priv8 mentions 0.4.4
