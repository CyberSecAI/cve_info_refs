Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-1005:

**Verification:**
The provided documents explicitly mention CVE-2004-1005 and describe it as relating to "Multiple buffer overflows" in Midnight Commander. This aligns with the official CVE description which refers to buffer overflows.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the presence of multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities within the Midnight Commander application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflows are present in the code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could exploit these buffer overflows to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running Midnight Commander.
- This could also lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is not precisely specified, but it involves exploiting the buffer overflows present in the application. This likely means that the overflows can be triggered via the handling of crafted data.
- The Gentoo advisory states that the vulnerability is "exploitable remotely", implying that the crafted data may not need to originate from the local machine or file system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide crafted input that can trigger the buffer overflows.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the vulnerable code.
