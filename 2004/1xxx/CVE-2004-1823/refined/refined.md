Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the JelSoft vBulletin XSS vulnerabilities:

*   **Vulnerability:** Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Software:** JelSoft vBulletin.
*   **Affected Versions:** vBulletin 3.0.0 RC4 and potentially earlier versions.
*   **Root Cause:** Improper input validation in several PHP files allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into web pages viewed by other users. The report indicates that vBulletin does not adequately sanitize user-supplied input, making XSS attacks easier to execute.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited through the following parameters in the specified PHP files:
    *   `showthread.php?t=[VID]&page=[INT][XSS]`
    *   `forumdisplay.php?f=[VID]&page=[INT]&sort=lastpost&order=[XSS]`
    *   `memberlist.php?action=getall&what=[XSS]&ltr=&perpage=25&orderby=username` (affects versions prior to 3.0).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of a user's browser when they visit a vulnerable page. This can lead to:
    *   Disclosure of user information.
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs containing the XSS payload and entice users to visit them. This could be achieved through:
    *   Posting malicious links on the forum.
    *   Sending phishing emails.
    *   Other social engineering techniques.
*   **Details beyond CVE description:** This provides specific vulnerable files and parameters.
