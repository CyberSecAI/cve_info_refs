Vendor  : Jelsoft Enterprises
URL     : <http://www.vbulletin.com>
Version : vBulletin 3.0.0 RC4 && Others
Risk    : Cross Site Scripting

Description:
vBulletin is a powerful, scalable and fully customisable forums package
for your web site. Based on the PHP language, backed with a blisteringly
fast MySQL back-end database, vBulletin is the ideal community solution
for all medium-to-large sites.

Cross Site Scripting:
JelSoft vBulletin is prone to attack in three different files (maybe more)
The files affected are "showthread.php", "forumdisplay.php", and also the
"memberlist.php" file. The "memberlist.php" does not seem to be prone to
the same attack I am about to talk about in versions three and later. The
type of XSS that takes place though on vBulletin is what I would call a
higher risk XSS issue. What I mean by that is a lot of times slashes will
be added to certain characters, or certain strings/characters disallowed,
but in vBulletin you can enter pretty much anything and have it execute
successfully. This makes it a whole lot easier for an attacker to use these
vulnerabilities to disclose a users information. Below are examples of the
issues I have talked about here. Remember, the "memberlist.php" issue only
seems to affect versions prior to 3.0, but the others affect all versions.

showthread.php?t=[VID]&page=[INT][XSS]
forumdisplay.php?f=[VID]&page=[INT]&sort=lastpost&order=[XSS]
memberlist.php?action=getall&what=[XSS]&ltr=&perpage=25&orderby=username

Solution:
JelSoft were notified and there will probably be a release of a patch or
update to resolve these issues. Who knows, they might even charge you for
the upgrade also :P heheh
