Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in EmuLive Server4:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Unauthorized Admin Access:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly validate or handle session IDs when accessing administrative pages. It appears that the application uses a session ID located between two slashes in the URL, but allows access without a valid session ID if the slashes are present.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper session management and lack of authentication enforcement.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can gain full administrative access to the server, allowing them to manage server statistics, affiliate data, eCommerce reports, and other sensitive information, and perform administrative actions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a URL with "//" after the host info, e.g., `<http://localhost//PUBLIC/ADMIN/INDEX.HTM>`, bypassing the expected session ID check.
    *   **Required Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs network access to the server.

2.  **Remote Server Crash:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application's handling of connections on TCP port 66 is flawed. Specifically, sending a sequence of carriage returns causes the server to crash.
    *   **Weakness:**  Insufficient input validation and error handling for network connections.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the server, making it unavailable.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a sequence of eight or more carriage returns to the server on TCP port 66.
    *    **Required Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs network access to the server on TCP port 66.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The unauthorized admin access vulnerability also reveals the potential for session hijacking, where an attacker can obtain valid session credentials from another machine.
*   The server crash vulnerability was reported to cause the server machine to freeze requiring a hard reset.
* The provided content includes a link to the original advisory with proof of concept, but the linked website only contains generic information about SOC 2 compliance.
