  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `displaycontent()` function in `config.php` does not properly validate the input provided via the `show` parameter in the URL.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Full path disclosure: When no value is provided for the `show` parameter, the function generates an error message including the installation path. Path traversal: The function does not sanitize the input in the `show` parameter allowing the use of `../` sequences to access arbitrary files.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Full path disclosure can reveal sensitive information about the server's filesystem structure. Path traversal can lead to the disclosure of sensitive files, such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hosts`, or server configuration files like `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely by crafting specific URLs with the vulnerable `show` parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be an unauthenticated remote user."
