Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2004-1882:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `strItems` parameter in `mailorder.asp` and `payonline.asp` scripts is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `strImageTag` parameter in the `largeimage.asp` script is not sanitized, allowing injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  Lack of input validation and sanitization on the `strItems` parameter allows attackers to modify SQL queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Lack of input validation and sanitization on the `strImageTag` parameter allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Remote code execution on the server via `xp_cmdshell` in MS SQL Server. Attackers can execute system commands on the server.
    *   Potentially access or modify sensitive data stored in the database.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Session hijacking, where attackers can steal user session IDs.
    *   Access to user's personal data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  Attackers manipulate the `strItems` parameter via HTTP requests to `mailorder.asp` or `payonline.asp`.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into the `strImageTag` parameter via a crafted URL to `largeimage.asp`. Users must then be tricked into visiting the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected scripts with crafted input.
    *   The application must be using MS SQL Server as a backend to enable `xp_cmdshell` execution.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   The attacker needs to craft a URL with malicious JavaScript code injected into the `strImageTag` parameter.
    *   The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory details failed attempts at fixing the vulnerabilities. CactuSoft attempted to escape single quotes for the SQL injection and remove HTML tags for the XSS, but the S-Quadra team was able to bypass these mitigations.
*   The advisory provides Proof of Concept (PoC) code demonstrating the exploit for both vulnerabilities.
*   The advisory indicates that CactuSoft ceased communication with the researchers after the bypass of the initial fixes.
