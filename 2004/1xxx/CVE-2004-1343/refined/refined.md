- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CVS server crashes when the `cvs-repouids` file exists but lacks a mapping for the current repository.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: A missing mapping in the `cvs-repouids` file leads to a crash of the CVS server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote user can cause a denial of service (DoS) by triggering the server crash.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote user can trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the CVS server in a way that causes it to access a repository without a corresponding mapping in `cvs-repouids`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the CVS server remotely.
