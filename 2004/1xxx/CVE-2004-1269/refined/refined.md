{
  "CVE-2004-1269": {
    "description": "The lppasswd program in CUPS does not verify that the passwd.new file is different from STDERR, which allows local users to overwrite the password file with arbitrary content or deny further password modifications by redirecting the output to the password file instead of creating a new file.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `lppasswd` program does not validate if the new password file (`passwd.new`) is different from the standard error (STDERR).",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper file validation",
         "Lack of input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "Local users can overwrite the CUPS password file with arbitrary content, leading to unauthorized access or denial of service. Users can also prevent further password modifications.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local access is required for exploitation. An attacker needs to be able to execute the `lppasswd` command.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "Local user privileges are required to execute the lppasswd program."
    }
