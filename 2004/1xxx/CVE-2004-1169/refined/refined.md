Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in MaxDB WebTools:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **WebDav handler long 'Overwrite' header stack overflow:**
    *   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the WebDAV handler when processing a long 'Overwrite' header.
    *   **Weakness:**  Improper bounds checking when handling the 'Overwrite' header allows for a stack-based buffer overflow.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution as root or SYSTEM.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with an overly long "Overwrite" header.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker with the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

2.  **Funny 'wahttp' NULL pointer dereference:**
    *   **Root Cause:** A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists within the 'wahttp' component when handling specific invalid requests.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper handling of requests for non-existent files.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS).
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a "GET" request for a non-existent file via a `telnet` connection.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker who can send raw HTTP requests.

**Affected Software:**

*   MaxDB WebTools version 7.5.00.18 and prior.

**Fix:**

*   MaxDB 7.0.19 is reported to address these vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory indicates that the WebDAV overflow vulnerability is "easy to exploit" and could lead to remote root/SYSTEM access.
*   The 'wahttp' NULL pointer dereference is described as "funny," which implies it might have been an unintended consequence of the code or easy to spot.

This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description by including the specific attack vectors and exploit methods used for both vulnerabilities. It also specifies that the stack overflow leads to remote root/SYSTEM access.
