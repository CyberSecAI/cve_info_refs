- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The server is unable to properly handle certain wide characters (16-bit) in network data, leading to a crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of wide characters, lack of input validation/sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Server crash, denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted wide characters via network communication to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker capable of sending network data to the server.
