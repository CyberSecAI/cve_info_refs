        "vulnerability": "Basic Authentication Out-of-Bounds Read (Denial of Service)",
        "description": "When faced with a Basic authentication request without a password, Monit will decrement a pointer returned by a strchr() call without appropriate NULL pointer checking. The error results in a segmentation fault during a strcpy() call. This request can be generated with a simple web browser. Specifically, if the base64-decoded credentials string does not contain a colon, the vulnerability can be exploited.",

          "description": "When faced with a POST submission that is exactly 1,024 bytes, Monit suffers from an off-by-one overflow. Exploitability depends upon the version of gcc used to compile the application. Some compilers will allow this overflow to modify the frame pointer, potentially controlling stack frames.",
