| [Description](#c0)  Rajiv Aaron Manglani (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-10 21:18:26 UTC  ``` From: 	  jon@squirrelmail.org 	Subject: 	[SquirrelMail Security Advisory] Cross Site Scripting in encoded text 	Date: 	November 10, 2004 1:04:51 AM EST 	To: 	  squirrelmail-devel@lists.sourceforge.net, squirrelmail-announce@lists.sourceforge.net 	Cc: 	  squirrelmail-users@lists.sourceforge.net, squirrelmail-plugins@lists.sourceforge.net, bugtraq@securityfocus.com  SquirrelMail Security Notice ============================  About ----- SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP4. It includes built-in pure PHP support for the IMAP and SMTP protocols, and all pages render in pure HTML 4.0 (with no JavaScript required) for maximum compatibility across browsers. It has very few requirements and is very easy to configure and install. SquirrelMail has all the functionality you would want from an email client, including strong MIME support, address books, and folder manipulation.  Details ------- There is a cross site scripting issue in the decoding of encoded text in certain headers. SquirrelMail correctly decodes the specially crafted header, but doesn't sanitize the decoded strings.  Affected -------- SquirrelMail 1.4.3a and earlier SquirrelMail 1.5.1-cvs before 23rd October 2004  Resolution ---------- A patch has been published to resolve this issue for the SquirrelMail 1.4.3a branch, and can be downloaded from here:   <http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/squirrelmail/sm143a-xss.diff?download>  To apply this patch, copy the sm143a-xss.diff file into the base SquirrelMail directory, and follow the command:    patch -p0 < sm143a-xss.diff  Those using SquirrelMail 1.5.1-cvs should update using CVS, or use a copy of the latest snapshot downloadable from the SquirrelMail website at:    <http://www.squirrelmail.org>   Acknowledgements ---------------- Special thanks goes to Joost Pol for notifying us about this issue.   Comments -------- The SquirrelMail development team work hard with people reporting security issues in an attempt to resolve issues. We appreciate those that are willing to dedicate the time to work with us on any issue they uncover in the SquirrelMail project.  If any further issues are uncovered, a dedicated mail address can be used to report the issue.  The address is security@squirrelmail.org.  --  Jonathan Angliss (jon@squirrelmail.org) ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-10 22:34:20 UTC  ``` Jeremy please provide a fixed ebuild. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Jeremy Huddleston (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-11 00:23:50 UTC  ``` the second chunk of that patch looks bad...

# SquirrelMail: Encoded text XSS vulnerability — GLSA **200411-25**

Squirrelmail fails to properly sanitize user input, which could lead to a
compromise of webmail accounts.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/squirrelmail** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.3a-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.3a-r2** |

### Background

SquirrelMail is a webmail package written in PHP. It supports IMAP and
SMTP, and can optionally be installed with SQL support.

### Description

SquirrelMail fails to properly sanitize certain strings when decoding
specially-crafted headers.

### Impact

By enticing a user to read a specially-crafted e-mail, an attacker can
execute arbitrary scripts running in the context of the victim's
browser. This could lead to a compromise of the user's webmail account,
cookie theft, etc.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All SquirrelMail users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/squirrelmail-1.4.3a-r2"
```

Note: Users with the vhosts USE flag set should manually use
webapp-config to finalize the update.
