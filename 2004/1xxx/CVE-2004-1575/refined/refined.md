Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted XML document that uses XML attributes in a way that leads to excessive CPU resource consumption by the XML parser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core weakness lies in the way Xerces-C++ 2.5.0 handles XML attributes, leading to a denial of service (DoS).
- The vulnerability stems from the parser's inefficient handling of maliciously crafted attribute structures within an XML document.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The XML parser consumes 100% CPU resources, making the target machine unresponsive.
- The duration of the CPU resource exhaustion can vary from seconds to minutes depending on the size of the malicious XML document.
- It is noted that a few hundred KB of specially crafted XML can cause a target machine to consume 100% CPU for several minutes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a malicious XML document.
- The attacker needs to send/provide the malicious XML document to the target machine using the vulnerable Xerces-C++ parser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted XML document to a system that uses Xerces-C++ 2.5.0 to parse it.
- No specific privileged access or position is specified for the attacker.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Xerces-C++ version 2.6.0.
- The advisory mentions that the vendor was contacted and a fix was made available.
