| [Description](#c0)  Tom Hosiawa    2004-07-20 09:45:07 UTC  ``` Subversion 1.0.6 is ready. Grab it from:    <http://subversion.tigris.org/tarballs/subversion-1.0.6.tar.gz>   <http://subversion.tigris.org/tarballs/subversion-1.0.6.tar.bz2>   The MD5 checksums are:    160c655194dff55f9fdd856110801d01  subversion-1.0.6.tar.gz   bb05fe041fef7491b3555904d97f5e1c  subversion-1.0.6.tar.bz2  PGP Signatures are available at:    <http://subversion.tigris.org/tarballs/subversion-1.0.6.tar.gz.asc>    <http://subversion.tigris.org/tarballs/subversion-1.0.6.tar.bz2.asc>  PGP Signatures will be made by the following person(s) for this release:    Ben Reser [1024D/641E358B] with fingerprint:    42F5 91FD E577 F545 FB40  8F6B 7241 856B 641E 358B   This is likely the last bugfix release in the 1.0.x line.    Subversion versions up to and including 1.0.5 have a bug in mod_authz_svn that allows users with write access to read portions of the repository that they do not have read access to.  Subversion 1.0.6 and newer (including 1.1.0-rc1) are not vulnerable to this issue.  Details: ========  mod_authz_svn would allow a user to copy portions of a repo to which they did not have read permissions to portions that they did have  read permissions on, thereby evading the read restrictions.  Severity: =========  This is a low risk issue.  Only sites running mod_authz_svn (an Apache module) that are trying to restrict some of their users with write access to a repo from reading part of that repo are vulnerable.  Most installations will not fall into this category. Additionally, any attempt to use such a vulnerability will be apparent as the copy will be versioned.  Plus, it's doubtful any site would permit public write access to its repository so this issue should not be accessible by unauthenticated users.  This vulnerability does not affect users running svnserve.  Workarounds: ============  * Disable DAV and use svnserve.  * Separate content into different repos.  * Disable the COPY method via Apache configuration.  Note this will   disallow all copies.  Recommendations: ================  We recommend all users upgrade to 1.0.6 or 1.1.0-rc1.   Questions, comments, and bug reports to users_at_subversion.tigris.org.

HP-UX B.11.11
=============
hpuxwsAPACHE
action: install revision A.2.0.54.02 or subsequent

=============
hpuxwsAPACHE
action: install revision B.2.0.54.02 or subsequent
END AFFECTED VERSIONS
RESOLUTION:
HP has made the following software updates available to resolve
the issue:
HP-UX B.11.00 - Apache revision A.2.0.54.02 or subsequent
HP-UX B.11.11 (IPv4) - Apache revision A.2.0.54.02 or subsequent
HP-UX B.11.11 (IPv6) - Apache revision B.2.0.54.02 or subsequent
HP-UX B.11.22 - Upgrade to HP-UX B.11.23
HP-UX B.11.23 - Apache revision B.2.0.54.02 or subsequent
NOTE: Support ended for HP-UX Web Server Suite for HP-UX 11i v1.6
(B.11.22) after March 31, 2004. HP-UX Web Server Suite for
HP-UX 11i v1.6 (B.11.22) is no longer available or
supported.
Users of HP-UX Web Server Suite on HP-UX 11i v1.6 are
encouraged to update to HP-UX 11i v2 (B.11.23) and install
the latest HP-UX Web Server Suite for HP-UX 11i v2.
Please write to security-alert (at) hp (dot) com [email concealed] for more information.
Apache Update Procedure
Check for Apache Installation
- -----------------------------
To determine if the Apache web server from HP is installed on your
system, use Software Distributor's swlist command. All three
revisions of the product may co-exist on a single system.
For example, the results of the command
swlist -l product | grep -i apache
hpuxwsAPACHE B.2.0.52.00 HP-UX Apache-based Web Server
Stop Apache
- -----------------------------
Before updating, make sure to stop any previous Apache binary.
Otherwise, the previous binary will continue running, preventing
the new one from starting, although the installation would be
successful. After determining which Apache is installed, stop
Apache with the following commands:
for hpuxwsAPACHE: /opt/hpws/apache[32]/bin/apachectl stop
Download and Install Apache
- -----------------------------
- Download Apache from Software Depot:
<http://h20293.www2.hp.com/portal/swdepot/displayProductInfo.do?
productNumber=HPUXWSATW213>
- Verify successful download by comparing the cksum with the
value specified on the installation web page.
- Use SD to swinstall the depot.
Installation of this new revision of HP Apache over an existing
HP Apache installation is supported, while installation over a
non-HP Apache is NOT supported.
Removing Apache Installation
- ----------------------------
If you prefer to remove Apache from your system instead of
installing a newer revision to resolve the security problem,
use both Software Distributor's "swremove" command and also
"rm -rf" the home location as specified in the rc.config.d file
"HOME" variables.
%ls /etc/rc.config.d | grep apache
hpapache2conf
hpws\_apache[32]conf
MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - Update plus other actions
Install the revision of the product.

# Subversion: Vulnerability in mod\_authz\_svn — GLSA **200407-20**

Users with write access to parts of a Subversion repository may bypass read
restrictions in mod\_authz\_svn and read any part of the repository they
wish.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-util/subversion** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.0.4-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.6** |

### Background

Subversion is an advanced version control system, similar to CVS, which
supports additional functionality such as the ability to move, copy and
delete files and directories. A Subversion server may be run as an
Apache module, a standalone server (svnserve), or on-demand over ssh (a
la CVS' ":ext:" protocol). The mod\_authz\_svn Apache module works with
Subversion in Apache to limit access to parts of Subversion
repositories based on policy set by the administrator.

### Description

Users with write access to part of a Subversion repository may bypass
read restrictions on any part of that repository. This can be done
using an "svn copy" command to copy the portion of a repository the
user wishes to read into an area where they have write access.

Since copies are versioned, any such copy attempts will be readily
apparent.

### Impact

This is a low-risk vulnerability. It affects only users of Subversion
who are running servers inside Apache and using mod\_authz\_svn.
Additionally, this vulnerability may be exploited only by users with
write access to some portion of a repository.

### Workaround

Keep sensitive content separated into different Subversion
repositories, or disable the Apache Subversion server and use svnserve
instead.

### Resolution

All Subversion users should upgrade to the latest available version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=dev-util/subversion-1.0.6"
 # emerve ">=dev-util/subversion-1.0.6"
```
