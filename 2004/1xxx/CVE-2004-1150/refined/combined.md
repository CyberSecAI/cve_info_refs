How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

NSFOCUS Security Advisory(SA2005-01)

Topic: Buffer Overflow in WinAMP in_cdda.dll CDA Device Name

Release Date: 2005-01-27

CVE CAN ID: CAN-2004-1150

<http://www.nsfocus.com/english/homepage/research/0501.htm>

Affected systems & software
===========================
Nullsoft WinAMP 5.0
Nullsoft WinAMP 5.01
Nullsoft WinAMP 5.02
Nullsoft WinAMP 5.03
Nullsoft WinAMP 5.04
Nullsoft WinAMP 5.05
Nullsoft WinAMP 5.06
Nullsoft WinAMP 5.07
Nullsoft WinAMP 5.08

Unaffected systems & software
=============================
Nullsoft WinAMP 2.X
Nullsoft WinAMP 5.08c

Summary
=========

WinAMP is a popular media player that supports various media and playlist
formats, including playlists in m3u or pls format.

NSFocus Security Team has found a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
plug-in by which WinAMP plays CD. An attacker can construct a malicious playlist
file that is embedded in a HTML page. If a user is persuaded to click it,
then the attacker can gain complete control over the user's system.

Description
============

WinAMP implements various functionalities through different plug-ins that
are stored in "plugins" sub-directory of WinAMP installation directory. For
example, in_mp3.dll is used to play MP3 files and in_cdda.dll is used to
play CD.

The in_cdda.dll of WinAMP supports play path requests in the following format:

  1. <Driver\><PathName\>[FileName].cda
  2. linein://
  3. cda://
  4. cda://<Driver>
  5. cda://<Driver>,<TrackNumber>

Brett Moore of Security-Assessment.com discovered a stack overflow when in_cdda.dll
handles the first path. WinAMP released version 5.07 to fix that vulnerability.

Actually, in_cdda.dll will still cause an overflow when handling 4th and 5th
path above. Stack overflow will be triggered only by adding an over-long device
name or sound track number behind "cda://".

Any method that can pass a play path to WinAMP can be used to trigger this
vulnerability, for example, command line.

One possible remote attacking vector is to construct a playlist file in m3u
or pls format with an over-long path embedded in HTML. Once a user visits
such a malicious page, it will execute the code of attacker's choice.

Workaround
=============

NSFOCUS suggests to remove in_cdda.dll from Plugins of WinAMP.

Vendor Status
==============

2004.11.24  Informed the vendor support@winamp.com, no response
2004.12.06  Tests proved winamp 5.07 is affected, informed the vendor again
2004.12.07  The vendor confirmed the vulnerability
2004.12.25  Tests proved winamp 5.08 is affected, informed the vendor
2005.01.10  The vendor released winamp 5.08c to fix the vulnerability

The vendor has released winamp 5.08c to fix this vulnerability. The latest
version is available at <http://www.winamp.com/player/>

Additional Information
========================

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CAN-2004-1150 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in the
CVE list (<http://cve.mitre.org>), which standardizes names for security problems.
Candidates may change significantly before they become official CVE entries.

Acknowledgment
===============

Yu Yang of NSFOCUS Security Team found the vulnerability.
