{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow in the embedded HTTP server of the USRobotics USR808054 wireless access point.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the HTTP version string processing within GET requests to the embedded HTTP server.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the access point, disconnecting all wireless users. It may also be possible to execute arbitrary code, gaining complete control over the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted GET request with an oversized HTTP version string to the access point's HTTP server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the wireless access point and be able to send HTTP requests to its port 80. No administrator password is required for this attack."
