Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in VU#702086, which is related to CVE-2004-1104:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way multiple web browsers handle the `BASE` and `FORM` elements within HTML. Specifically, when a `BASE` element precedes a `FORM` element, certain browsers display the URL from the `BASE` element in the status bar, while actually accessing the URL specified in the `FORM` element when a link is clicked. This discrepancy allows for URL spoofing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **URL Spoofing:** The primary vulnerability is that the displayed URL in the status bar does not match the actual URL that is accessed when a link is clicked.
- **Incorrect URL Interpretation:** Browsers are not consistently handling the `BASE` and `FORM` elements, leading to this discrepancy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing/Social Engineering:** An attacker can mislead users into believing they are visiting a legitimate website when they are actually being directed to a malicious site.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** By directing users to a malicious site, attackers can employ additional social engineering tactics to steal credentials, credit card numbers, or other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Pages:** Attackers can craft malicious web pages that exploit this vulnerability using the `BASE` and `FORM` elements.
- **Link Manipulation:** Attackers can distribute malicious links through emails or other means that point to these crafted pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host Web Content:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious pages designed to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** To be fully effective, the attacker would need to use social engineering techniques to trick users into interacting with the malicious links and disclosing sensitive information.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability does not require active scripting (JavaScript) to be enabled for Internet Explorer exploitation.
- The provided content identifies multiple affected browsers including Internet Explorer and Safari, while others like Mozilla, Opera, and Konqueror are listed as not affected.
- The document from cert.org does not include a CVSS score.
