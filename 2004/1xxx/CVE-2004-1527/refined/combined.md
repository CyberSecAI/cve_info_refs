How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SNS Advisory No.79
A Possibility of Cookie Overwrite in Microsoft Internet Explorer

Problem first discovered on: Mon, 01 Sept 2003
Published on: Mon, 15 Nov 2004
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity Level:
---------------
  Low

Overview:
---------
  Microsoft Internet Explorer contains a vulnerability that could cause a
  Cookie to be overwritten under certain conditions.

Problem Description:
--------------------
  Microsoft Internet Explorer fails to check certain character strings
  when accepting cookies.

  If Internet Explorer accepts a cookie with a crafted Path attribute,
  it becomes possible to overwrite a cookie issued by another site under
  specific conditions.

  [Preconditions for the exploit]
    1. If the target domain name contains the attacker's domain name,
       or if the target IP address contains the attacker's IP address

    2. If the target site is running a Web service on a wildcard domain

  Exploitation therefore, could make it possible for attackers to hijack
  Web sessions and login as legitimate users.

Tested Versions:
----------------
  Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 Service Pack 1

Solution:
---------
  If you use Windows XP, apply Service Pack 2.
  Or as an alternative workaround, change the configuration as follows:

   1. When accepting a cookie, please set to prompt a dialog in [Internet Options].

      1) Go to [Privacy] -> [Advanced]

      2) In the "Cookies" section, check the "Override automatic cookie
         handling" checkbox.

      3) Under First-party Cookies, select [Prompt]

      4) Click [OK]

   2. Please choose [Block Cookie] to cancel cookies that do not start with "/".
