Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of password protection on the `/rpFWUpload.html` page of ZyXEL Prestige 650 HW routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The `/rpFWUpload.html` page, which includes a reset button, is accessible without any authentication or password checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Router Reset:** An attacker can remotely reset the router's configuration to its default settings. This can lead to a denial of service, as it disrupts network connectivity for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router. This could be from the internet if remote administration is enabled, or from within the local network if the attacker is on the same network.
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request directly to the `/rpFWUpload.html` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to reach the router's IP address on port 80 (or the port where the HTTP management interface is accessible).
- **No Authentication Required:** No login credentials are required to access the vulnerable page.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker only needs to navigate to the vulnerable URL and click the reset button.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is also present in ZyXEL Prestige 623/652 models.
- The web management interface is often enabled by default on these devices.
- The fix would require password protection on the `/rpFWUpload.html` page.
