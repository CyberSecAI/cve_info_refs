- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Design errors in the `fcronsighup` program.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `fcronsighup` program allows a local user to bypass access restrictions, view the contents of root-owned files, remove arbitrary files, create empty files, and send a SIGHUP to any process. Specifically, this CVE relates to the ability to view the contents of root-owned files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to perform a Denial of Service on the system running Fcron.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
