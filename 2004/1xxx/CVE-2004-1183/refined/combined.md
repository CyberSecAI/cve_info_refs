# tiff: New overflows in image decoding — GLSA **200501-06**

An integer overflow has been found in the TIFF library image decoding
routines and the tiffdump utility, potentially allowing arbitrary code
execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.7.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.7.1-r1** |

### Background

The TIFF library contains encoding and decoding routines for the
Tag Image File Format. It is called by numerous programs, including
GNOME and KDE applications, to interpret TIFF images.

### Description

infamous41md found a potential integer overflow in the directory
entry count routines of the TIFF library (CAN-2004-1308). Dmitry V.
Levin found another similar issue in the tiffdump utility
(CAN-2004-1183).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a carefully crafted
TIFF image file, which would potentially lead to execution of arbitrary
code with the rights of the user viewing the image. This affects any
program that makes use of the TIFF library, including many web browsers
or mail readers.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All TIFF library users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.7.1-r1"
```

Package        : tiff
Vulnerability  : unsanitised input
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-1183

Dmitry V. Levin discovered a buffer overflow in libtiff, the Tag Image
File Format library for processing TIFF graphics files.  Upon reading
a TIFF file it is possible to crash the application, and maybe also to
execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.5-6.woody5.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.1-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your libtiff package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

===========================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-54-1		   January 06, 2005
tiff vulnerability
CAN-2004-1183
===========================================================

A security issue affects the following Ubuntu releases:

Ubuntu 4.10 (Warty Warthog)

The following packages are affected:

libtiff-tools

The problem can be corrected by upgrading the affected package to
version 3.6.1-1.1ubuntu1.2.  In general, a standard system upgrade is
sufficient to effect the necessary changes.

Details follow:

Dmitry V. Levin discovered a buffer overflow in the "tiffdump"
utility. If an attacker tricked a user into processing a malicious
TIFF image with tiffdump, they could cause a buffer overflow which at
least causes the program to crash. However, it is not entirely clear
whether this can be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user opening the image.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
