Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2004-1158:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Konqueror web browser allows websites to load web pages into a window or tab that is currently being used by another website. This is due to insufficient restrictions on how Konqueror handles window and tab loading.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Window Injection:** A malicious website can inject its content into a window or tab opened by a trusted website or trick a trusted website into loading content into an existing window or tab.
-  This vulnerability is similar to a previous "Frame Injection Vulnerability" but the fix for that did not cover the window case.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Confusion:**  An attacker can confuse the user about the origin of the webpage. The user may believe they are interacting with a trusted website when they are actually interacting with a malicious site.
- **Confidential Information Theft:**  Users may unknowingly send confidential information intended for the trusted website to the malicious website due to the misleading content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious website crafts a web page that exploits the window injection vulnerability in Konqueror.
- The user visits the malicious website which then injects its content into a window or tab that was originally opened by a trusted website.
- The user may also be tricked by a trusted website into loading malicious content if the trusted website is vulnerable to such attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious website or find a way to inject the attack into a trusted website.
- The target user needs to use the Konqueror web browser, specifically versions up to and including KDE 3.3.2.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is assigned the identifier CAN-2004-1158 by the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project.
- Secunia was involved in discovering and reporting the vulnerability.
- Patches were made available for KDE 3.2.3 and 3.3.2.
- The issue is a variant of a previous frame injection vulnerability, but the fix did not apply to window injection.
