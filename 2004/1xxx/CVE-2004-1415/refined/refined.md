- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$id_album`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive data like user passwords and other database information. In the provided proof of concept, the attacker was able to extract the password for the first album.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `id_album` parameter in the `disp_album.php` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application and manipulate the `id_album` parameter. No special privileges are required.
