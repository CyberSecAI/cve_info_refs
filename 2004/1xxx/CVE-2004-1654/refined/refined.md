Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in phpWebSite 0.9.3-4 and earlier:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  Lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data, specifically in the "cal_template" field within the calendar module, allows for the injection of malicious SQL statements.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Insufficient filtering of user input in the comments module, allowing for the injection of arbitrary code via the `CM_pid` parameter.
*   **Script Injection:** Inadequate sanitization of input in the notes module, specifically the subject and message fields, allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
*  **Forced Command Execution:**  Unsafe usage of GET requests and lack of authorization checks before executing key administrative functions, allows an attacker to execute administrative functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The application does not sanitize the `cal_template` field before using it in an SQL query.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application displays user-provided data in the comments module without proper encoding or sanitization.
*   **Script Injection:** User provided data in the subject and message of the notes module is not sanitized allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.
*   **Insecure Direct Object References & Missing Authorization:** The application allows direct access to administrative functions via GET requests without verifying authorization or using secure access methods like POST requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive data, modify data, or even gain control of the database.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker can execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, phishing, or defacement of the website.
*   **Script Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious code into private messages that can be used to force command execution on the user viewing the message.
*   **Forced Command Execution:** An attacker can gain administrative privileges, delete users (including the admin), ban users, delete forum posts, and make other administrative changes to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** By submitting a crafted event to the calendar module with malicious SQL code in the `cal_template` field.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** By crafting a URL with malicious JavaScript in the `CM_pid` parameter in the comments module.
*   **Script Injection:** By sending a crafted private message with malicious HTML or JavaScript code in the subject and message fields.
*   **Forced Command Execution:** By sending malicious URLs with administrative commands embedded within them (such as `/index.php?module=users&user_op=user_deify&deification=bestow&user_id=4`) to the user that needs to execute them. This can be achieved by exploiting XSS or Script Injection vulnerabilities and embedding malicious URLs in images or iframes, causing the user's browser to trigger the requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For **SQL injection**, an attacker needs to be able to submit an event to the calendar module. By default, anyone can submit events for approval.
*  For **Cross-Site Scripting**, an attacker only needs to craft a specific URL and entice a user to click it or include it on a page visited by other users.
*   For **Script Injection**, an attacker needs to be able to send private messages to users.
*   For **Forced Command Execution**, the attacker does not need access to the application's backend. They need to trick a user (preferably an administrator) to visit a malicious link. This can be accomplished using the XSS and Script Injection vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided text indicates that the GET request vulnerability allows an attacker to perform administrative tasks, including deleting users and forums, ban users and even granting administrative privileges to themselves.
* The advisory mentions that the developers were aware of the vulnerabilities and a patch was released.
* The advisory also mentions that a more comprehensive security update will be released at the end of the year.
