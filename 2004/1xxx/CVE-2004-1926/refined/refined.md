Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in TikiWiki as described in the provided text:

**Vulnerability 1: Path Disclosure**
*   **Root Cause:**  Several PHP files within TikiWiki fail to properly handle null or non-existent values when called directly, leading to the disclosure of the full physical path of the web directory on the server. Additionally, SQL errors generated by tampering with parameters can also reveal the server path.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation, insufficient error handling, and inconsistent preventative measures across files.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can learn the server's file system path, which can aid in further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Directly accessing vulnerable PHP files with invalid or null parameters. Tampering with parameters that can lead to SQL errors.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  Basic knowledge of web requests and parameters.

**Vulnerability 2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
*   **Root Cause:** Many parts of TikiWiki do not properly sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it on the web page. This allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Insufficient input sanitization and output encoding.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application, which can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious sites.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code via vulnerable URL parameters or user input fields.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Knowledge of JavaScript and XSS attack vectors.

**Vulnerability 3: SQL Injection**
*   **Root Cause:**  Several parameters such as `sort_mode` and `offset` are passed directly into SQL queries without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation and insufficient sanitization of data passed into SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, modifying data, or disrupting the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Manipulating the `sort_mode` and `offset` parameters within HTTP requests to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Knowledge of SQL and SQL injection techniques.

**Vulnerability 4: Code Injection**
*   **Root Cause:**  User-controlled input is not properly sanitized before being stored and later displayed, allowing for the injection of code (likely HTML/JavaScript).
*   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of proper input sanitization in user profiles and directory input fields.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject code into the web application, potentially leading to XSS or other attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Injecting code via user profile fields and directory input fields.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Basic understanding of HTML/JavaScript or other code that can be interpreted by the browser.

**Vulnerability 5: Remote File/Directory Enumeration Via Traversal**
*   **Root Cause:** The map feature in TikiWiki allows directory traversal through the `mapfile` parameter, enabling access to files and directories outside the web root directory.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation in the map feature's `mapfile` parameter, allowing directory traversal.
*  **Impact:** Attackers can confirm the existence of arbitrary files and directories on the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating the `mapfile` parameter in `tiki-map.phtml` to traverse to sensitive directories or files.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Basic understanding of directory traversal techniques and web request manipulation.

**Vulnerability 6: Arbitrary File Upload**
*   **Root Cause:**  The image upload feature in user profile creation allows users to upload arbitrary files, which are stored in a publicly accessible directory.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of restrictions on the types of files that can be uploaded and the location where they are stored.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can upload and execute malicious scripts on the server, potentially gaining full control of the web server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Uploading malicious files using the image upload function when creating a TikiWiki user page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to register a user account, knowledge of web file upload procedures and understanding of how to execute server-side code.
