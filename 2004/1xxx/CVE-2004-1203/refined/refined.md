The provided content describes a vulnerability in phpCMS version 1.2.1, which aligns with the format of a CVE description but does not contain a CVE ID itself. Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- An implementation error in the validation of user input within the `parser/parser.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Information Disclosure:** When phpCMS is configured in non-stealth mode with debug mode activated, the script reveals the full path to the phpCMS root directory in error messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Allows for attacks such as session hijacking, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of user accounts.
- **Information Disclosure:** The full path disclosure can assist an attacker in further attacks by revealing the server's directory structure.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Sending a crafted URL to `parser/parser.php` with malicious JavaScript code injected into the `file` parameter:  `http://[somehost]/parser/parser.php?file=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
- Sending a crafted URL to `parser/parser.php` with a non-existent file in the `file` parameter: `http://[somehost]/parser/parser.php?file=donotexist`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted URLs to the vulnerable phpCMS installation.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- For the information disclosure vulnerability, the phpCMS instance needs to be running in debug mode and non-stealth mode.
