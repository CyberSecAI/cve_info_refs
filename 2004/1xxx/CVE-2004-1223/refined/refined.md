- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web server component of F-Secure Policy Manager's Management Agent discloses the physical installation path due to insufficient input validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path disclosure vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the physical installation path of the F-Secure Management Server. This information could be used as a starting point for further attacks, such as locating configuration files or other sensitive resources.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed through the webserver running on port 80/tcp. The attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `/fsms/fsmsh.dll?` without authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable service, which is typically on the local network. No authentication is required.
