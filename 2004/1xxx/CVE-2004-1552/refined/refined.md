Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2004-1552:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2004-1552, specifically in the exploit-db entry (EDB-ID: 3546). The content describes SQL injection vulnerabilities in "aspWebCalendar" versions 4.5 (as stated by exploit-db entry).

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `eventid` parameter in `calendar.asp` is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
*   The login pages of both aspWebCalendar and aspWebAlbum are also vulnerable when using SQL databases due to lack of proper sanitization. The username parameter can be manipulated to inject SQL queries.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can potentially read sensitive data from the database by injecting SQL queries. Examples provided show how to extract admin usernames/passwords.
*   **Data Modification:** It's possible for an attacker to modify or delete data from the database using SQL injection, although not specifically detailed, it is an implicit possibility.
*   **Complete system compromise:** Depending on the database configuration and permissions, SQL injection could be used to gain complete control over the database server and potentially gain remote code execution.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerabilities are triggered through HTTP GET requests to the following vulnerable URLs, specifically by manipulating the parameters `eventid` (aspWebCalendar) and `cat` (aspWebAlbum).
    *   `/calendar.asp?action=viewevent&eventid=[SQL]`
    *   `/calendar.asp?action=eventdetail&eventid=[SQL]`
    *   `/album.asp?cat=[SQL]`
*   **Login Pages**: The login page of both applications can be attacked by supplying SQL injection in the `username` parameter.
    *   `/album.asp?action=login`
    *   `/calendar.asp?action=login`

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to construct malicious queries.
*   **Publicly Accessible:** Vulnerable resources are publicly accessible, therefore the attacker does not require any further authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides a concrete example of exploiting the `eventid` parameter.
*   The marc.info content highlights vulnerabilities in both aspWebCalendar and aspWebAlbum, although CVE-2004-1552 only relates to the former. It confirms the SQL injection can be used to extract usernames and passwords.
* The exploit-db entry mentions "aspWebCalendar 4.5"
*   The vulnerability was discovered in 2004.
