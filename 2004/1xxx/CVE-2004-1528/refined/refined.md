Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in the Event Calendar module for PhpNuke, as reported in waraxe-2004-SA#038:

*   **Vulnerabilities:**

    *   **A - Full Path Disclosure:** The application reveals the full server path in `config.php`, `index.php`, and `submit.php`.

        *   **Weakness:** Information Leakage
        *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing the files directly through a web browser.
        *   **Impact:** Exposes sensitive file system information.
    *   **B - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple XSS vulnerabilities exist due to unsanitized input in the `submit.php` script, specifically in the `type`, `day`, `month`, and `year` parameters.

        *   **Weakness:** Input Validation
        *   **Attack Vector:** Crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript code injected into the vulnerable parameters.
        *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, or defacement.
        *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to construct malicious URLs and potentially social engineer users to click on them.
    *   **C - Script Injection in Calendar Event Comments:** Users can inject JavaScript code into event comments. When other users or administrators view these comments, the injected script executes.

        *   **Weakness:** Input Validation
        *   **Attack Vector:** Inserting malicious JavaScript code in event comments.
        *   **Impact:** Cookie theft, arbitrary admin operations, and other malicious actions.
        *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to post comments to events.
    *   **D - SQL Injection:** The code contains multiple SQL queries where the variables `$eid` and `$cid` are not properly quoted.

        *   **Root Cause:** Improperly sanitized variables are used in SQL queries
        *   **Weakness:** Input Validation, SQL Injection
        *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the `eid` parameter in the URL.  Example:  `http://localhost/nuke73/modules.php?name=Calendar&file=index&type=view&eid=-99%20UNION%20ALL%20SELECT%20%201,1,aid,1,pwd,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1%20FROM%20nuke_authors%20WHERE%20radminsuper=1`
        *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially retrieve sensitive data (like admin credentials), modify data, or even compromise the entire database.
        *   **Required Capabilities:**  Knowledge of SQL and the database structure, ability to craft malicious SQL queries. The attacker can retrieve admin usernames and passwords if the MySQL version is 4.x with UNION functionality enabled.

*   **Affected Software:** Event Calendar Module versions 2.13 and likely earlier, for PHP-Nuke.

*   **Vendor Response:** The vendor was contacted but did not provide a patch.
