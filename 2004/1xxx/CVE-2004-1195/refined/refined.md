The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in the game Star Wars Battlefront, versions 1.11 and earlier.

**A] limited buffer-overflow in nickname**

*   **Root cause:** The server fails to properly validate the length of the nickname provided by a client during the join process.
*   **Weaknesses:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to insufficient bounds checking.
*   **Impact:**  The overflow is described as "limited" and does not appear to allow arbitrary code execution. It's likely to cause a denial-of-service by crashing the server.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending an overly long nickname to the server during the join process.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker must be able to connect to the game server and send modified join requests. The server must not be password protected.

**B] crash caused by arbitrary memory access**

*   **Root cause:** The server uses a 32-bit value from the client's join request as a memory offset to create a debug message.
*   **Weaknesses:** The server does not validate the memory offset provided by the client, allowing the client to specify any arbitrary memory address.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can force the server to read from an invalid memory address, causing a crash (denial of service).
*   **Attack vectors:**  Sending a join request with a malicious memory offset value to the server.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker must be able to connect to the game server and send modified join requests. The server must not be password protected.

The content also mentions that these vulnerabilities are in-game bugs, meaning that they can only be exploited if the server is not password-protected. The vulnerability is present in the Windows version of the game server, which is also used for the Playstation 2 dedicated server. The Xbox and Playstation 2 game platforms were not tested directly.

The author provides a proof of concept tool named "swbfp" that can trigger both vulnerabilities.
