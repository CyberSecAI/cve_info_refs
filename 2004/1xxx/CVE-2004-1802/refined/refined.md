- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly handle null bytes (%00) in usernames.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation allows a user to inject a null byte into their nickname, which is then used in the administrative interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can hide their IP address from the administrator, preventing them from being banned or kicked from the chat server. This allows the attacker to potentially disrupt the chat service without administrative intervention.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, via a web browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user of the chat server and be able to send a request containing %00 in their nickname, which can be achieved through a specially crafted HTML file.
