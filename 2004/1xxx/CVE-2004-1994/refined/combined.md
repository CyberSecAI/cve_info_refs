As well as well known XSS vunerabilities the latest version 4.0 seems to have some \
other issues.

Unpatched releases of V4.0 allow the user to access the Template banning.cfm without \
any administrative privleages. All users of the software should check with \
fusetalk.com for the latest security patches to prevent this being misused.

Access to this template allows any user to ban any other users and seems to be \
particularly vunerable. Fortunately it does not affect the administration templates, \
merely the moderation ones so the chances of an attacker gaining higher levels of \
access seem unlikely.

Another issue seems to exist which I have only so far tested on Version 2.0 and am \
unsure if this also occurs in V3-4, it appears that within the administration \
templates adduser.cfm allows parameters to be passed by a get statement rather than a \
post statement.

This potential vunerability could allow a hostile to create a new account by tricking \
some other person with moderator powers. Although it may seem obvious that a link to  \
<http://www.victim.com/admin/adduser.cfm?FTVAR_FIRSTNAMEFRM=God&FTVAR_LASTNAMEFRM=God&F> \
TVAR_EMAILADDRESSFRM=Attacker@acker.com&FTVAR_USERNAMEFRM=attacker&FTVAR_PASSWORDFRM=c \
oolpass&FTVAR_PASSWORD2FRM=coolpass&FTVAR_USERFORUMSFRM=0&FTVAR_USERTYPEFRM=g&FTVAR_US \
ERLEVELFRM=0&FTVAR_STATUSFRM=1&FTVAR_CITYFRM=&FTVAR_STATEFRM=70&FTVAR_COUNTRYFRM=36&FTVAR_SCRIPTRUN=self.close%28%29%3B&FTVAR_RETURNERROR=Yes&FT_ACTION=adduser
 would create a new account, if the adress is hidden within an image tag [img][/img] \
then the event will fire the creation of the account when the administrators web \
browser attempts to download the image.

This could be extended by the variable FTVAR_SCRIPTRUN=self.close which even in not \
creating an account would be capable running malicious javascript when an \
administrative user attempted to follow the link.

Since fusetalk relies nearly entirely on POST based data the best fix for this is to \
restrict posting of data by a GET statement.
