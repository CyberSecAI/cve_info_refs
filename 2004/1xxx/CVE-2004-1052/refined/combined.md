Debian Security Advisory DSA 595-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze

Package        : bnc
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-1052

Leon Juranic discovered that BNC, an IRC session bouncing proxy, does
not always protect buffers from being overwritten.  This could
exploited by a malicious IRC server to overflow a buffer of limited
size and execute arbitrary code on the client host.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.4-3.3.

This package does not exist in the testing or unstable distributions.

We recommend that you upgrade your bnc package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Date		   :  November 10th, 2004
Advisory URL:	   :  <http://security.lss.hr/en/index.php?page=details&ID=LSS-2004-11-03>
Impact		   :  Remote code execution or DoS attack
Risk level	   :  High
Vulnerability type :  Remote
Vendors contacted  :  [www.gotbnc.com](http://www.gotbnc.com), November 7th, 2004

---

===[ Overview

BNC is an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) proxying server under the GPL. It
allows users to connect to chat servers by bouncing off the computer which
is running BNC. Basically, it forwards the information from the user to the
server and vise versa.

===[ Vulnerability

There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in getnickuserhost() function that
is called when BNC is processing response from some IRC server. When BNC is
connected to some IRC server, it will send 'USER' and 'NICK' command. Server
response is at some point processed with getnickuserhost() function.

Vulnerable code:
----------------
int getnickuserhost(char **argv,char *buf,char *fix)
{
        int p,c;
        c=0;
        argv[[0]](#0)=buf;

        for(p=0;buf[p];p++)
        {
                if(buf[p] == '!')
                {
                        buf[p]='\0';
                        fix[c++]='!';
                        argv[[1]](#1)=&buf[p+1];
                }
                if(buf[p] == '@')
                {
                        buf[p]='\0';
                        fix[c++]='@';
                        argv[[2]](#2)=&buf[p+1];
                }
        }
        return c;
}
----------------

'buf' points to 512+1 bytes static buffer (in BSS segment) that contains
server response, and 'fix' points to 3 byte stack buffer. If there is '!'
or '@' character in server response (buf), it will be written to 'fix'.
Number of '!' and '@' characters that can be written to 'fix' isn't
limited, so it is possible to overflow it.
Function getnickuserhost() is called from functions srv_nick() and
ismenuh(), and ismenuh() is called from srv_part() and process_join(), so
there are few possible exploitation paths.

srv_nick() example:
----------------
int srv_nick(struct cliententry *cptr, char *prefix, int pargc, char
**pargv)
{
        int p,repc,c,f;
        char repv[[3]](#3);
        char *nuh[[3]](#3);
	...
	c=strlen(prefix);

        repc = getnickuserhost(nuh, prefix, repv);
	...
        for(p=0;p<c;p++)
        {
                if( prefix[p] == '\0' )
                {
                        if(repc > 0)
                        {
                                prefix[p]=repv[f++];
                                repc--;
                        }
                }
        }
	...
----------------

Since stack can be overflowed just with '!' and '@' characters, it isn't
easy to exploit this vulnerability. It could be exploited with off-by-one
or off-by-two frame overflow, but some partial EIP overflow could also
prove to be useful. It is also possible to overflow 'c' counter that could
have some impact later in 'for' loop.

===[ Affected versions

Vulnerability has been discovered and tested on latest BNC 2.8.9, but older
versions are affected too. Vulnerability can be exploited if attacker
tricks user to connect to his fake IRC server that will exploit this
vulnerability. If the attacker has access to BNC proxy server, this
vulnerability can be used to gain shell access on machine where BNC proxy
server is set.

===[ Fix

Vendor has released a patched version - bnc-2.9.0.

The source of the patched version can be downloaded from:
<http://www.gotbnc.com/files/bnc2.9.0.tar.gz>

===[ PoC Exploit

Proof of concept code can be downloaded from <http://security.lss.hr/en/PoC/>

BNC status after PoC overflow:
----------------------
[root@laptop bnc2.8.9]# gdb ./bnc 11313
...
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x21212121 in ?? ()
...
eax            0x1	1
ecx            0x30	48
edx            0x30	48
ebx            0x21212121	555819297
esp            0xbffff790	0xbffff790
ebp            0x21212121	0x21212121
esi            0x21212121	555819297
edi            0x21212121	555819297
eip            0x21212121	0x21212121
eflags         0x210246	2163270
...
----------------------
After PoC overflow, BNC daemon dies, and all users will be disconnected,
so this vulnerability can also be used as an DoS (Denial of Service)
attack.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
