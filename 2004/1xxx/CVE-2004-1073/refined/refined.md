{
  "cve": "CVE-2004-1073",
  "description": "The open_exec function may disclose information.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "Linux kernel 2.4 up to and including 2.4.27",
    "Linux kernel 2.6 up to and including 2.6.8"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A vulnerability in the common execve() code, specifically in the open_exec() function, allows for the reading of non-readable ELF binaries.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The open_exec() function incorrectly permits reading of non-readable ELF binaries when the filename is specified within the ELF PT_INTERP section.",
      "This is due to insufficient checks when opening files specified in the interpreter section of ELF binaries."
    ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged user can gain read access to privileged, exec-only setuid binaries, which can disclose sensitive information or be leveraged for further exploitation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious or crafted ELF binary is created.",
      "This ELF binary specifies the path of a non-readable, executable file (like a setuid binary) in the PT_INTERP section as a program interpreter.",
      "When the crafted binary is executed using execve(), the kernel's open_exec() function will open the specified privileged, non-readable file and provide read access."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create and execute a crafted ELF binary on the system."
  },
    "additional_notes": "This issue is related to a shared file table race condition. The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious ELF binary that requests a non-readable, executable file as its program interpreter. This allows for the disclosure of the binary content and can be used to gain offsets for further exploitation."
