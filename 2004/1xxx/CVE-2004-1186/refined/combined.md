# enscript: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200502-03**

enscript suffers from vulnerabilities and design flaws, potentially
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/enscript** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.3-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.6.3-r3** |

### Background

enscript is a powerful ASCII to PostScript file converter.

### Description

Erik Sjolund discovered several issues in enscript: it suffers
from several buffer overflows (CAN-2004-1186), quotes and shell escape
characters are insufficiently sanitized in filenames (CAN-2004-1185),
and it supported taking input from an arbitrary command pipe, with
unwanted side effects (CAN-2004-1184).

### Impact

An attacker could design malicious files or input data which, once
feeded into enscript, would trigger the execution of arbitrary code
with the rights of the user running enscript.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All enscript users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/enscript-1.6.3-r3"
```

Package        : enscript
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-1184 CAN-2004-1185 CAN-2004-1186

Erik Sjölund has discovered several security relevant problems in
enscript, a program to convert ASCII text into Postscript and other
formats.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following vulnerabilities:

CAN-2004-1184

    Unsanitised input can cause the execution of arbitrary commands
    via EPSF pipe support.  This has been disabled, also upstream.

CAN-2004-1185

    Due to missing sanitising of filenames it is possible that a
    specially crafted filename can cause arbitrary commands to be
    executed.

CAN-2004-1186

    Multiple buffer overflows can cause the program to crash.

Usually, enscript is only run locally, but since it is executed inside
of viewcvs some of the problems mentioned above can easily be turned
into a remote vulnerability.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.3-1.3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.4-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your enscript package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
