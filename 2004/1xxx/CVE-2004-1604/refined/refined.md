The content is related to the CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from cPanel's handling of FrontPage extensions installation, specifically how it creates and modifies the permissions of the `_private` directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Symlink vulnerability:** The system creates a directory named `_private`, but an attacker can delete it and create a symbolic link with the same name pointing to any file on the system.
- **Unprotected chmod:** The cPanel software, running with root privileges, performs a `chmod 755` operation on the target of the symlink.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can change the permissions of any file on the system to 755.

**Attack vectors:**
-  A user logged into cPanel can create a symlink and trigger the installation of FrontPage extensions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be a valid cPanel user with the ability to enable/disable front page extensions.
- The attacker needs to be able to create and remove files in their `public_html` directory.
