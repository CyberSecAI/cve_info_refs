Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2004-1079:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `ncplogin` and `ncpmap` utilities, specifically within the `strcpy_cw` function in `nwclient.c`.
*   The `strcpy_cw` function copies a null-terminated string from a char pointer to a wchar_t pointer without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The `strcpy_cw` function does not validate the size of the input `char* s` against the destination `wchar_t *w` buffer, `wc_treeName`, leading to a buffer overflow if `s` is too large.
*   **SUID Root Binaries:** The vulnerable `ncplogin` and `ncpmap` utilities are installed as SUID root, meaning they run with root privileges regardless of the user executing them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A local attacker can exploit the buffer overflow by providing an overly long string via the `-T` option to `ncplogin` or `ncpmap`.
*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges, leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have shell access to the system where `ncpfs` is installed.
*   The attacker provides a crafted command line argument using the `-T` option.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have local shell access to the system.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges before executing the attack.
*   The attacker needs to be able to execute the `ncplogin` or `ncpmap` utilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information includes a proof-of-concept example using `perl` to generate a long string: `ncplogin -T \`perl -e '{print"a"x"330"}'\`` and `ncpmap -T \`perl -e '{print"a"x"330"}'\``
*   The `MAX_DN_CHARS+1` is the size of the buffer and the attack vector is overwriting the buffer with 330 bytes which triggers the overflow
*   The vulnerability was present in `ncpfs` versions prior to 2.2.5.
