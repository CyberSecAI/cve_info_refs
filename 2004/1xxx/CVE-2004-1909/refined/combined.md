  [### TortoiseSVN](/projects/tortoisesvn/)

  An Apache SVN client, right where you need it most

  TortoiseSVN is a Subversion (SVN) client, implemented as a windows shell extension. Which means it's available right where you need it: in the Windows file explorer.
  It's intuitive and easy to use, since it doesn't require the Subversion command line client to run. Simply the coolest Interface to (Sub)Version Control!

  SIMD-accelerated libjpeg-compatible JPEG codec library

  libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON, AltiVec) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, ARM, and PowerPC systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg, all else being equal. On other types of systems, libjpeg-turbo can still outperform libjpeg by a significant amount, by virtue of its highly-optimized Huffman coding routines. In many cases, the performance of libjpeg-turbo rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.
  libjpeg-turbo implements both the traditional libjpeg API as well as the less powerful but more straightforward TurboJPEG API. libjpeg-turbo also features colorspace extensions that allow it to compress from/decompress to 32-bit and big-endian pixel buffers (RGBX, XBGR, etc.), as well as a full-featured Java interface.

  [### SWIG](/projects/swig/)

  A code generator for connecting C/C++ with other programming languages

  SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages. SWIG is used with different types of target languages including common scripting languages such as Javascript, Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl and Ruby. The list of supported languages also includes non-scripting languages such as C#, D, Go language, Java, Lua, OCaml, Octave, R and Scilab. Also several interpreted and compiled Scheme implementations (Guile, MzScheme/Racket) are supported. SWIG is most commonly used to create high-level interpreted or compiled programming environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++ software. SWIG is typically used to parse C/C++ interfaces and generate the 'glue code' required for the above target languages to call into the C/C++ code. SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML.

## Open Source Software Development Software Guide

Open source software development is a type of software which is published under an open source license, and its source code made available for free to the public. Open source projects typically involve the collaboration of developers from around the world who are able to freely modify, improve, and build upon each other's work. This creates unique opportunities for developers to share their knowledge and skills with each other while increasing their collective expertise.

The main benefits of open source software development include enhanced flexibility, speed of development, greater freedom to adjust and customize code, broader reach with users, better quality control and reliability through community input, improved collaboration between different teams or organizations working on related tasks/projects, more cost-effective access to technology infrastructure as no need to purchase expensive commercial licenses. Additionally there is usually an increased support from peers in dealing with technical issues or compatibility problems stemming from different versions or non-standard implementations. For example when something doesn't work as expected someone can post on a public forum about it or dig into the project’s issue tracker for help from other contributors.

Open source projects are also highly organized, often following some form of hierarchical structure; making them easier for new users or software developers wanting to contribute quickly familiarize themselves with task being taken by others in the group along with finding areas where they can be most useful in order provide valuable assistance & feedback. In addition due to large number of potential participants contributing towards same goal (and competing against one another) rewards such as reputation points & leaderboard rankings become quite common which help encourage people stay active within communities & ensure much higher level engagement than other collaborative platforms like forums/chat rooms etc. Last but not least many open sourced projects have dedicated “code review” teams that conduct regular audits over programming logic & coding standards thus ensuring highest possible degree accuracy before any proposed changes make it into mainline version of product.

In short, open source software development offers numerous advantages over traditional closed-source solutions allowing those involved reap benefit both professionanly & personally through enhanced learning opportunity potential partnerships created during process itself.

## Features of Open Source Software Development Software

Open Source Software Development Software provides a variety of features that can be used to create, customize and manage software projects. These features include:

* **Version Control:** This feature allows developers to have full control over the changes made in their code. It helps them to keep track of all versions of their project and make sure that they are always up-to-date.
* **Debugging Tools:** Debugging tools provide an easy way for developers to identify errors in their code. This helps them quickly find and fix issues before they become major problems.
* **Automation Systems:** Automation systems are used to automate tasks such as testing, deployment, and monitoring, thus reducing the time spent on mundane tasks.
* **Documentation Generator:** Many open source software development tools come with a documentation generator which creates comprehensive documentation for each project automatically. This makes it easier for developers to understand how the code works without having to spend too much time reading through it manually.
* **Collaboration Features:** Open source software development tools usually include collaboration features which allow teams from multiple locations or organizations work together effectively on a single project. Some of these features include shared repositories, bug tracking systems, and discussion boards where team members can communicate with each other easily about their projects.
* **Security Controls:** Open source software development tools come with various security controls to protect projects from malicious attacks. These include firewalls, encryption technology, and access controls which can be used to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the project.

## Types of Open Source Software Development Software

* **Collaborative Software:** This type of open source software development allows multiple users to work collaboratively on a single project from different locations. Features such as version control, task management, code review and bug tracking are commonly included in these types of software.
* **Community-Based Development Models:** These open source development models rely heavily on the community for support and input into the design process. This can include forums, mailing lists, IRC channels or other forms of online collaboration where developers can share ideas and discuss how to improve the product over time.
* **Forked Projects:** A fork occurs when one developer creates their own version of an existing project by taking its code base and making modifications that they believe will improve it or make it more suitable for their needs. Other developers may then choose to further modify this “forked” version or create related projects based off of it.
* **Custom Software Solutions:** Open source software allows companies or individuals to customize programs to meet their specific needs without having to build everything from scratch. By using existing components developed by others, creating custom solutions becomes much easier than starting from nothing.
* **Mobile Platforms:** Open source mobile platforms like Android and Fire OS allow anyone with coding knowledge to develop applications for those operating systems relatively easily compared to closed source platforms like iOS or Windows Phone. These platforms have also grown in popularity due to their low cost and ease of use.
* **Cloud-Based Development:** Open source software that is built on top of cloud services provides developers with the ability to easily access data from any location, deploy applications quickly and manage them remotely. This type of development has become increasingly popular for its scalability and cost effectiveness.

## Open Source Software Development Software Advantages

* **Cost-Effective:** Unlike proprietary software, open source software development is free. There are no expensive license fees to pay or ongoing costs associated with using the software. This cost savings can be a major advantage for businesses and individuals alike.
* **Widely Available:** Open source software development is widely available online and can often be downloaded without any restrictions. This makes it easy to access wherever you are located and from whichever device you’re using.
* **Flexible:** The flexibility of open source software allows for easier customization according to user needs. With the use of different programming languages, developers can make adjustments that fit the specific requirements of their project more easily than with proprietary programs.
* **Reliability:** Since open source projects have multiple contributors working on them simultaneously, bugs tend to get discovered quickly, allowing them to be fixed faster than those in proprietary programs. The code is also considered “open source” meaning anyone has the ability to review it for any potential issues that may arise in the future.
* **Security:** Open Source projects benefit from having many individuals look at their code which means there’s less likely it will contain a harmful backdoor created by a malicious hacker or developer. Additionally, since developers have access to the underlying code they can make sure that weaknesses aren't present in it or spot any potential flaws before someone else does and takes advantage of them.
* **Support Community:** Due to its wide availability, there are large communities available online where users can ask questions about how something works or how best interact with open source software development platforms. Similarly, as these communities grow so do the support resources available which provides an always accessible pool of knowledge should you ever need help with anything related to coding in general (not just with your project).
* **Innovation:** Open source software development encourages innovation and collaboration on a global level. By encouraging developers all over the world to work together, more ideas can be created, implemented, tested and improved upon faster than with proprietary programs. This allows for projects that would normally require a large team of developers to move forward at a much faster rate.

## Types of Users That Use Open Source Software Development Software

* **Beginner Users:** Users new to open source software development, who are looking to explore and learn the basic principles of computer programming.
* **Experienced Developers:** Individuals with coding experience, who use open source software development tools as part of their daily workflows. They have a thorough understanding of the fundamentals and may modify existing code or create new programs from scratch.

## How Much Does Open Source Software Development Software Cost?

Open source software development software is typically offered for free and can provide a high quality solution without any cost. The true cost of open source software development often comes in the form of additional resources needed to deploy, maintain, and troubleshoot the system. Without developers with sufficient expertise working on the project, costly mistakes or delays can result. Free online tutorials, forums, and support from other users are available to help address any issues that may arise during use. Additionally, some open source projects may require proprietary components such as web servers or database programs that must be purchased separately from third party vendors.

Overall, while there is no direct financial cost associated with using most open source software development platforms, there may be hidden costs related to the time taken to access community support or purchase necessary supplementary products that could add up over time.

## What Software Does Open Source Software Development Software Integrate With?

Open source software development software can integrate with various types of software such as code editors, version control systems, and bug tracking tools. Editors like Visual Studio Code allow developers to edit the code of open source projects while also providing the ability to access extensions and connect with other cloud-based services. Version control systems, like Git, offer developers a central repository for managing files within their project in a distributed environment. Tools such as Jira provide bug tracking capabilities which enable collaboration among team members as well as data visualization aids in debugging. Additionally, integrated development environments (IDEs) like Eclipse allow for easier navigation when developing open source projects by providing an all-inclusive user interface for creating applications. All of these types of software are capable of integrating with open source software development software to create an efficient and effective workflow.

## Trends Related to Open Source Software Development Software

## How Users Can Get Started With Open Source Software Development Software

Getting started with open source software development is relatively straightforward. The first step is to decide which type of open source software you want to use. There are a variety of open source programs available, ranging from simple word processors and image editors to more complex programming environments like Java or C++. Once you have selected the software you want to use, the next step is to download it. You can usually find these downloads on the website for the open source software project, or by searching an online repository.

Once your download is complete, install it on your computer just like any other program. Most open source projects provide either a graphical installation wizard that walks users through setting up the program, or clear instructions on how to manually set it up in the Readme file that comes with the download. After you’ve installed the program and opened it up for the first time, read any introductory tutorials that are provided by either community members or included in program documentation. This will help you quickly become familiar with how everything works and how to get started using it effectively before diving into more complicated tasks.

Finally, if you ever run into problems while working with an open source application, don't hesitate to reach out for help. Many projects have active discussion forums where people answer questions related to installing and using their software so if something isn't working properly or you can't figure out how to do something specific, feel free to search around and see if there's already an answer available. If not, you can also post your own question in the discussion and wait for one of the more experienced users to respond. With a little bit of searching and experimentation, you can soon be up and running with open source software development.

| [Description](#c0)  Johan Ymerson    2004-03-22 01:37:32 UTC  ``` Certain RAR archives (for example some archives produced by the Bagle virus) can RAR processor of clamav, leading to a denial of service.  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  schaedpq    2004-03-23 01:35:47 UTC  ``` The info about this bug from Bugtraq (<http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/9897/info/>) suggests to update to 0.68, not 0.70rc. Therefore (since marking an rc as stable in portage is IMHO not a good idea) the security update in the GLSA (if there will be one) should be 0.68, not 0.70rc.  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-03-26 14:54:08 UTC  ``` 4 days and pending in critical state..   I'll bump this on behalf of the antivirus herd as it seems they are to busy to notice this bug. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-03-26 15:04:23 UTC  ``` Updateded in portage as clamav-0.68 KEYWORDS="~x86 ~ppc ~sparc ~mips ~alpha ~hppa ~amd64 ~ia64"  Arch maintainers please test and mark stable when ready.  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Jon Portnoy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-03-26 17:27:30 UTC  ``` Stable on AMD64, removing from CC. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Jason Wever (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-03-26 18:03:19 UTC  ``` stable on sparc. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Johan Ymerson    2004-03-27 05:27:40 UTC  ``` Version 0.68 doesn't solve the problem with RAR archives, but disables RAR archive support completely. Version 0.68-1 does solve the problem. Before marking 0.68 as stable, I think we should jump to 0.68-1 instead. Otherwise all Beagle RAR archives will be ignored! ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Thomas Raschbacher   gentoo-dev  2004-03-29 02:08:30 UTC  ``` i'm using 0.70rc on 3 machines running stable and faster than 0.6x .. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Thomas Raschbacher   gentoo-dev  2004-03-29 02:53:47 UTC  ``` 0.68.1 in portage (aka 0.68-1) please test and mark stable :) ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Jason Wever (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-03-29 08:17:42 UTC  ``` Does someone have an infected rar file we can use for testing? ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Jason Wever (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-03-29 10:37:17 UTC  ``` clamav should also probably have a crypt useflag that pulls in gmp as the clamav config script will disable digital certificate support (used to check the validity of the db mirrors) if it is not available or gmp version 2 or above is not installed. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Thomas Raschbacher   gentoo-dev  2004-03-29 11:29:35 UTC  ``` 1) just try to scan a .rar archive ;)  2) true .. please add a bug for the gmp dep bug or i'll forget it again (planned to do b4 ;)   (in a hurry now ;)  reagards ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Jason Wever (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-03-29 11:46:22 UTC  ``` I don't have any rar archives, so I can't test them.  Providing a test or two for everyone will help expedite this.  Additionally, without the gmp fix it's very hard to ensure people are fully testing clamav before marking it stable, since some people may not be building digitial certificate support if they don't have gmp (which is how i found the dependency).  If you really want a second bug that's fine but it should really be included in 0.68.1 for the GLSA (imo at least). ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2004-03-29 18:47:45 UTC  ``` stable on hppa ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Thomas Raschbacher   gentoo-dev  2004-03-30 00:47:19 UTC  ``` dep for dev-libs/gmp is in. i added a dep for the dev-libs/gmp version i compiled it with. ppc,mips,hppa ppl please test dev-libs/gmp too and bump to stable first(maybe the lower version works too but it is marked stable on less archs than the newer one.) ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Chris Russell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-03-30 03:26:49 UTC  ``` I put the eicar test virus in raw, rar'd and layered compressed formats here; <http://dev.gentoo.org/~cjr/testvirus/> ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-03-30 03:58:45 UTC  ``` need to draft GLSA -- who wants this one? ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Thomas Raschbacher   gentoo-dev  2004-03-30 04:03:21 UTC  ``` what do u mean 'wants' it? ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-03-30 04:20:02 UTC  ``` Just asking one of the security folks to handle writing up the GLSA.

If not, what's the next course of action? ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Aron Griffis (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-03-30 08:30:50 UTC  ``` Marked clamav-0.68.1.ebuild stable on alpha and ia64, removing from cc ```  [Comment 21](#c21)  Sven Blumenstein (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-03-30 13:23:15 UTC  ``` >> eicar-test.rar: RAR module failure  It should report the virus and not break, right? ```  [Comment 22](#c22)  Jason Wever (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-03-30 13:33:34 UTC  ``` Correctl, clamscan should be able to see the virus in the RAR and report on it.  However the clamav docs do mention that the rar support is extermely experimental and may not work correctly.  So it seems like the DoS may be fixed but the program is possibly not functioning as desired. ```  [Comment 23](#c23)  Thomas Raschbacher   gentoo-dev  2004-03-31 00:44:28 UTC  ``` i posted this link to clamav-users mailinglist. i hope someone who really knows about this will comment on it. ```  [Comment 24](#c24)  Chris Russell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-03-31 02:40:12 UTC  ``` out of curiosity Jason, did it detect the non rar variants ok? ```  [Comment 25](#c25)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-03-31 05:07:14 UTC  ``` feel free to disagree with me, but as long as the DoS is fixed (and because it sounds like this problem isn't a severe one that prevents the entire program from working) I'd rather mark this stable now so we can issue the GLSA and inform our users of the vulnerability.

# ClamAV RAR Archive Remote Denial Of Service Vulnerability — GLSA **200404-07**

ClamAV is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when processing certain
RAR archives.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-antivirus/clamav** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.68** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.68.1** |

### Background

From http://www.clamav.net/ :

"Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose
of this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded
daemon, a command line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via
Internet. The programs are based on a shared library distributed with
the Clam AntiVirus package, which you can use with your own software.
Most importantly, the virus database is kept up to date."

### Description

Certain types of RAR archives, including those created by variants of
the W32.Beagle.A@mm worm, may cause clamav to crash when it attempts to
process them.

### Impact

This vulnerability causes a Denial of Service in the clamav process.
Depending on configuration, this may cause dependent services such as
mail to fail as well.

### Workaround

A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are
advised to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.

### Resolution

ClamAV users should upgrade to version 0.68.1 or later:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.68.1"
 # emerge ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.68.1"
```
