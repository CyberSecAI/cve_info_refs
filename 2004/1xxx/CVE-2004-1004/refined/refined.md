Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-1004:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2004-1004 is multiple format string vulnerabilities within the Midnight Commander (mc) application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Multiple format string vulnerabilities. This means that user-controlled input is being used as part of a format string, allowing an attacker to potentially read from and write to arbitrary memory locations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact of exploiting these format string vulnerabilities is the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Midnight Commander.
- Additionally, a denial-of-service (DoS) can occur, as mentioned in the Debian advisory where some of the related vulnerabilities were due to memory issues.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector would likely involve crafting malicious input to mc that exploits the format string vulnerability. This input would be processed by mc through a vulnerable formatting function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to provide input to Midnight Commander that is then processed using vulnerable formatting functions.
- This would typically involve interacting with Midnight Commander through user interfaces where the vulnerable input can be passed.
- No information is available about remote vs. local attack vectors. However, since the vulnerability is a format string, it is likely exploitable locally when an attacker can control the input passed to Midnight Commander.

**Additional details:**

- The Gentoo advisory mentions that the vulnerability could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
- The Debian advisory explicitly states that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable.

In summary, CVE-2004-1004 concerns multiple format string vulnerabilities in Midnight Commander that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.
