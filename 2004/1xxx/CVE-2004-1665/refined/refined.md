The content relates to CVE-2004-1665.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The PsNews 1.1 application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `no` parameter of the `index.php` script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, potentially leading to:
    - Cookie theft
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Other client-side attacks

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through specially crafted URLs:
    - a) Using the `show_all` function with a malicious script tag in the `no` parameter
    - b) Using the `add_kom` function with malicious HTML code in the `no` parameter

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL and entice a user to click it or access a web page containing it.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
