Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The BitDefender Scan Online ActiveX control had a function that allowed a remote attacker to download and execute arbitrary files on the user's system. Additionally, it exposed user's private information, allowing an attacker to see the user's drive and folder structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unrestricted File Download and Execution:** The ActiveX control's `RequestFile` function could download any file from a remote URL and execute it locally on the user's system. This function was accessible via the HTML object tag.
*   **Private Information Disclosure:** The ActiveX control also had the ability to display the user's file system structure, revealing sensitive information to a remote attacker. This functionality was also accessible via the HTML object tag.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The ActiveX control's properties and functions could not be accessed by using the `ActiveXObject` object in JavaScript, but could be accessed by embedding the ActiveX object in HTML using the `<object>` tag, bypassing expected access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine by downloading and running a malicious executable. This could lead to complete system compromise.
*  **Private Information Disclosure:** An attacker could view the user's file system, potentially gaining access to sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote with browser:** The vulnerability could be exploited remotely through a web browser by embedding malicious HTML content containing the vulnerable ActiveX control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage or inject malicious HTML into a webpage the victim visits.
*   The attacker needs to know the CLSID of the vulnerable ActiveX control (80DD2229-B8E4-4C77-B72F-F22972D723EA).
* The attacker requires the target to have the vulnerable BitDefender ActiveX component installed, by visiting the specified page: <http://www.bitdefender.com/scan/Msie/index.php>

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in the "AVXSCANONLINE.AvxScanOnlineCtrl.1" ActiveX control.
*   The vendor, BitDefender, released an update to address the vulnerability. Users had to visit the scan online page to receive the update.
* The vendor requested prior notification before public disclosure.
