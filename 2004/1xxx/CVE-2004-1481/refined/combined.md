How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RealPlayer pnen3260.dll Heap Overflow

Release Date:
October 1, 2004

Date Reported:
August 09, 2004

Severity:
High (Remote Code Execution)

Vendor:
RealNetworks

Systems Affected:
Windows:
RealPlayer 10.5 (6.0.12.1040 and earlier)
RealPlayer 10
RealPlayer 8 (Local Playback)
RealOne Player V2
RealOne Player V1

Mac Player:
RealPlayer 10 Beta for Mac OS X (Local Playback)
RealOne Player (Local Playback)

Linux Player:
Linux RealPlayer 10 (Local Playback)
Helix Player (Local Playback)

Overview:
eEye Digital Security has discovered a critical vulnerability in
RealPlayer. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to reliably
overwrite heap memory with arbitrary data and execute arbitrary code in
the context of the user who executed the player.

This specific flaw exists within the pnen3260.dll file used by
RealPlayer. By specially crafting a malformed .rm movie file along with
a SMIL file, a direct heap overwrite is triggered, and reliable code
execution is then possible.

Technical Details:
The code in pnen3260.dll among other things is responsible for handling
.rm files. The vulnerability is triggered by setting the length field of
the VIDORV30 data chunk to 0xFFFFFFF8 - 0xFFFFFFFF this will cause an
integer overflow which leads to a small block of memory being allocated,
we call this movie from a SMIL file to handle the initial exception,
eventually overflowing the buffer.

Protection:
Retina Network Security Scanner has been updated to identify this
vulnerability.

Vendor Status:
RealNetworks has released a patch for this vulnerability. The patch is
available via the "Check for Update" menu item under Tools on the
RealPlayer menu bar.
