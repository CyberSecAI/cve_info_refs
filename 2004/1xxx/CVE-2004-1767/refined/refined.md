Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in Sun Solaris's implementation of loadable kernel modules (LKMs). The system allows an unprivileged local user to load arbitrary kernel modules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the lack of proper access control or validation when loading kernel modules, allowing any local user to load arbitrary code into the kernel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an unprivileged local user to gain root privileges. This is achieved by loading a malicious kernel module, which can then execute arbitrary code with kernel-level permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local. An attacker with a normal user account can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have a local user account on the vulnerable Sun Solaris system. They do not require any special privileges or advanced access.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided document refers to "Sun Alert ID: 57479" for information about patches.
- This vulnerability is present in Sun Solaris which supports loadable kernel modules.
- The provided document does not contain a CVE ID.
