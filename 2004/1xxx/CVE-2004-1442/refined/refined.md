      "is_related": true,
      "description": "IBM Net.Data fails to properly validate user input passed to the db2www CGI interpreter. This allows an attacker to mount a cross-site scripting attack against a vulnerable system. The db2www CGI interpreter does not validate requested macro filenames before returning an error message (DTWP001E). By using a specially crafted macro filename, an attacker can inject malicious script (JavaScript, VBScript, etc.) or HTML into the error message.",
      "root_cause": "The db2www CGI interpreter fails to properly validate user input, specifically macro filenames.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
      ],
       "impact": "A remote attacker could access sensitive information related to the vulnerable web page (cookies, form values, URI data) or mislead the user into providing sensitive information such as login credentials.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted macro filename in a request to the db2www CGI interpreter."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send requests to the vulnerable server, specifically targeting the db2www CGI interpreter with specially crafted macro filenames.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs because the db2www CGI interpreter does not sanitize or validate the macro filenames which are returned in a DTWP001E error message. By inserting javascript into the macro filename, the attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser within the context of the target website."
