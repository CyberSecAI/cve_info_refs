# HylaFAX: hfaxd unauthorized login vulnerability ‚Äî GLSA **200501-21**

HylaFAX is subject to a vulnerability in its username matching code,
potentially allowing remote users to bypass access control lists.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/hylafax** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.0-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.0-r2** |

### Background

HylaFAX is a software package for sending and receiving facsimile
messages.

### Description

The code used by hfaxd to match a given username and hostname with
an entry in the hosts.hfaxd file is insufficiently protected against
malicious entries.

### Impact

If the HylaFAX installation uses a weak hosts.hfaxd file, a remote
attacker could authenticate using a malicious username or hostname and
bypass the intended access restrictions.

### Workaround

As a workaround, administrators may consider adding passwords to
all entries in the hosts.hfaxd file.

### Resolution

All HylaFAX users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/hylafax-4.2.0-r2"
```

Note: Due to heightened security, weak entries in the
hosts.hfaxd file may no longer work. Please see the HylaFAX
documentation for details of accepted syntax in the hosts.hfaxd file.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 634-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
January 11th, 2005                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : hylafax
Vulnerability  : weak hostname and username validation
Problem-Type   : local/remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-1182

Patrice Fournier discovered a vulnerability in the authorisation
subsystem of hylafax, a flexible client/server fax system.  A local or
remote user guessing the contents of the hosts.hfaxd database could
gain unauthorised access to the fax system.

Some installations of hylafax may actually utilise the weak hostname
and username validation for authorized uses.  For example, hosts.hfaxd
entries that may be common are

  192.168.0
  username:uid:pass:adminpass
  user@host

After updating, these entries will need to be modified in order to
continue to function.  Respectively, the correct entries should be

  192.168.0.[0-9]+
  username@:uid:pass:adminpass
  user@host

Unless such maching of "username" with "otherusername" and "host" with
"hostname" is desired, the proper form of these entries should include
the delimiter and markers like this

  @192.168.0.[0-9]+$
  ^username@:uid:pass:adminpass
  ^user@host$

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1-3.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your hylafax packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
