Based on the provided documents, here's the analysis of CVE-2004-1176:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer underflow within the Midnight Commander (mc) application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Buffer underflow:** This occurs when a program attempts to read data before the beginning of an allocated buffer, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering the buffer underflow, potentially causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** While not explicitly stated for the buffer underflow, the broader set of vulnerabilities in mc (format string errors, buffer overflows, and memory deallocation errors) could be combined to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker would need the ability to interact with the Midnight Commander application in a way that triggers the buffer underflow condition.
*   The attacker would likely need some level of understanding of how the mc application processes input to craft the necessary malicious input.

**Additional notes:**

*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 639-1) lists CVE-2004-1176 alongside multiple other vulnerabilities affecting mc. This suggests that the buffer underflow was part of a larger set of security issues in the application.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200502-24) also groups this vulnerability with format string errors, buffer overflows, and memory deallocation errors.
*   The Red Hat content does not contain specific details about CVE-2004-1176.
