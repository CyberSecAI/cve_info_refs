  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The default installation of NetScreen-Security Manager does not enable encryption for communications with devices running ScreenOS 5.0.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cleartext transmission of sensitive information.",
          "Lack of encryption by default"

        "Network eavesdropping/interception of traffic between NetScreen-Security Manager and managed devices."
