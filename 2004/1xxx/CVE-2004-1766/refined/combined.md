## NetScreen-Security Manager fails to encrypt communications with managed devices

#### Vulnerability Note VU#927630

Original Release Date: 2004-01-22 | Last Revised: 2004-01-23

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the NetScreen-Security Manager software could expose sensitive information in cleartext over the network.

### Description

| [NetScreen](http://www.netscreen.com/home.jsp) Technologies' [NetScreen-Security Manager](http://www.netscreen.com/products/central_management/nsm.jsp) provides centralized management for control of device configuration, network settings and security policies. According to a [security advisory](http://www.netscreen.com/services/security/alerts/1_19_04_58290.jsp) released by NetScreen:  *The default installation of NetScreen-Security Manager does not automatically enable encryption of communications between NetScreen appliances and systems running ScreenOS 5.0 and the Device Server component of the management system.**All communications between NetScreen-Security Manager and devices running ScreenOS 5.0 are clear text, allowing interception of configuration data by third parties, unless the fix below is implemented.*Sensitive information contained in the configuration data, such as configuration passwords, could be exposed to an attacker. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Sensitive information being sent between the system running the Security Manager and the managed devices would be exposed in cleartext over the network. An attacker who was able to intercept network traffic between these systems may then be able to use this information to influence malicious configuration changes in the managed devices. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**NetScreen's [advisory](http://www.netscreen.com/services/security/alerts/1_19_04_58290.jsp) provides the following mitigation steps for this vulnerability:*Either of the following options will enable 128-bit AES encryption between NetScreen-Security Manager and devices running ScreenOS 5.0:**(1) Add the following line in the devSvr.cfg file located in the /usr/netscreen/DevSvr/var/ folder, then restart DevSvr services:* *devSvrManager.cryptoKeyLength 128**- -OR-**(2) As root, run the script 'addCryptoParam.sh', which is available on the NetScreen-Security Manager downloads page at www.netscreen.com/cso, then restart DevSvr services.**NetScreen-Security Manager 2004 Feature Pack 1, available at a later date, will also address this issue.* |

Affected

### Vendor Statement

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Title: NetScreen Security Advisory 58290
Date: 19 January 2004
Impact: Communications between devices running ScreenOS 5.0 and
NetScreen-Security Manager not encrypted
Affected Products: NetScreen-Security Manager 2004 used with devices
running ScreenOS 5.0
Max Risk: High

Summary:

The default installation of NetScreen-Security Manager does not
automatically enable encryption of communications between NetScreen
appliances and systems running ScreenOS 5.0 and the Device Server
component of the management system.

All communications between NetScreen-Security Manager and devices
running ScreenOS 5.0 are clear text, allowing interception of
configuration data by third parties, unless the fix below is
implemented.

Recommended Actions:

Either of the following options will enable 128-bit AES encryption
between NetScreen-Security Manager and devices running ScreenOS 5.0:

(1)  Add the following line in the devSvr.cfg file located in the
/usr/netscreen/DevSvr/var/ folder, then restart DevSvr services:

devSvrManager.cryptoKeyLength 128

- -OR-

(2)   As root, run the script 'addCryptoParam.sh', which is available
on the NetScreen-Security Manager downloads page at www.netscreen.com/cso,
then restart DevSvr services.

NetScreen-Security Manager 2004 Feature Pack 1, available at a later
date, will also address this issue.

How to Get NetScreen-Security Manager:

If you have registered your product with NetScreen and have a valid
service contract, you can simply download the software from:
<http://www.netscreen.com/cso>

You will be prompted for your User ID and Password. Enter the whole or
part of your company name as your User ID and enter your registered
NetScreen-Security Manager serial number as the password.

If you have not yet registered your product with NetScreen, you will
need to contact NetScreen Technical Support for special instructions on
how to obtain the fixed software. NetScreen Technical Support can be
reached from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific time Monday through Friday
excluding weekends and observed holidays. You may contact them via
email at:
support@netscreen.com
or via phone at:
877-638-7273 or 408-543-2100 Option #1

Please reference this Advisory title as evidence of your entitlement to
the fixed software version.

NetScreen authorized Value Added Resellers have access to NetScreen
software versions and may also be a channel through which to obtain the
new release.

### Vendor Statement

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Title: NetScreen Security Advisory 58290
Date: 19 January 2004
Impact: Communications between devices running ScreenOS 5.0 and
NetScreen-Security Manager not encrypted
Affected Products: NetScreen-Security Manager 2004 used with devices
running ScreenOS 5.0
Max Risk: High

Summary:

The default installation of NetScreen-Security Manager does not
automatically enable encryption of communications between NetScreen
appliances and systems running ScreenOS 5.0 and the Device Server
component of the management system.

All communications between NetScreen-Security Manager and devices
running ScreenOS 5.0 are clear text, allowing interception of
configuration data by third parties, unless the fix below is
implemented.

Recommended Actions:

Either of the following options will enable 128-bit AES encryption
between NetScreen-Security Manager and devices running ScreenOS 5.0:

(1)  Add the following line in the devSvr.cfg file located in the
/usr/netscreen/DevSvr/var/ folder, then restart DevSvr services:

devSvrManager.cryptoKeyLength 128

- -OR-

(2)   As root, run the script 'addCryptoParam.sh', which is available
on the NetScreen-Security Manager downloads page at www.netscreen.com/cso,
then restart DevSvr services.

NetScreen-Security Manager 2004 Feature Pack 1, available at a later
date, will also address this issue.
