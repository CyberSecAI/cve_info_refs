Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in AJ-Fork:

**Vulnerability 1: Full Path Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:**  Script files in the `plugins/` and `inc/` directories are not protected against direct access. When accessed directly, they trigger error messages revealing the installation path of the application.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of access control on script files.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of the server's internal file structure and potentially sensitive installation paths.
*   **Attack Vector:** Direct HTTP requests to vulnerable script files.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability with a web browser.

**Vulnerability 2: Directory Listing**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of directory listing protection for the `data`, `inc`, `plugins`, `skins`, and `tools` directories.
*  **Weakness**: Unrestricted access to sensitive directories and their contents.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can view lists of files within these directories, and potentially download sensitive files (e.g., `.pl`, `.mdu`).
*   **Attack Vector:** Direct HTTP requests to vulnerable directories.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** A remote attacker can browse these directories using a web browser.

**Vulnerability 3: Access to Backup Directory**

*   **Root Cause:** Inadequate protection of backup directories, specifically allowing access to the file listing. While a general warning is shown for the `data/backup/` directory, accessing specific backup subdirectories does not trigger any protections.
*   **Weakness:** Inconsistent access controls on backup directories.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can see the file structure of backups which could expose sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vector:** Direct HTTP requests to backup subdirectories (e.g., `data/backup/dudul`).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** A remote attacker can browse and access backup files by knowing or guessing directory names.

**Vulnerability 4: Access to Database File (users.db.php)**

*  **Root Cause:** The "users.db.php" file is stored in the `data/` directory, which, according to installation instructions in the `readme.htm` file, is given read/write permissions (777 or 755) to enable the application to read/write to its data files.
*   **Weakness:** Overly permissive file permissions for a sensitive database file and unsafe storage location.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read the database file to steal usernames, and encrypted passwords. An attacker with write access can inject malicious user entries, potentially gaining administrative privileges. The permissions required by the application enable this injection of records.
*   **Attack Vector:** Direct file system write access to `users.db.php`, or by reading the file remotely through the webserver by exploiting the directory listing vulnerability.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the attacker to either have write access to the server's filesystem or to be able to exploit the directory listing vulnerability to read the database file.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities**
The vulnerabilities include:
* Full path disclosure via unprotected script files, which reveals the server's file system paths.
* Directory listing vulnerability, which allows attackers to list files and potentially download sensitive data.
* Inconsistent access control on backup directories exposing sensitive data.
* Database file access (read/write/execute), allowing attackers to steal password hashes and inject malicious user accounts due to overly permissive file permissions.

The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely through a web browser or directly through filesystem access, depending on the specific attack vector.
