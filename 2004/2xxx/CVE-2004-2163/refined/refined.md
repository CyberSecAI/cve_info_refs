      "cve": "CVE-2004-2163",
      "content_type": "errata",
      "details": "This CVE entry is associated with multiple vulnerabilities addressed by patches in OpenBSD 3.5, and has multiple security fixes related to CVS, procfs, xdm, kerberos, isakmpd, httpd, Xpm, radius, telnet, copy, httpd mod_include, and isakmpd pfkey.  \n\n- **CVS:** Multiple vulnerabilities including pathname validation issues, heap overflows, buffer overflows, and memory leaks, allowing for arbitrary code execution, file creation outside repository, and client crashes. Attack vector: Malicious clients sending crafted requests to the CVS server.\n\n- **procfs:** Integer overflow vulnerability, with no further exploitation details.  Attack vector: Not specified, but possibly through crafted interactions with procfs.\n\n- **xdm:** Missing check on 'requestPort' resource allows socket creation even if xdmcp is disabled, potentially exposing the system to unwanted connections. Attack vector: Remote attacker.\n\n- **kdc:** Flaw due to inadequate checking of the \"transited\" field in a Kerberos request, allowing a Kerberos realm administrator to impersonate principals in other trusted realms. Attack vector: Malicious Kerberos realm administrator.\n\n- **isakmpd:** Vulnerable to unauthorized SA deletion, allowing an attacker to delete IPsec tunnels. Attack vector: Remote attacker.\n\n- **httpd / mod_ssl:** Multiple vulnerabilities (CAN-2003-0020, CAN-2003-0987, CAN-2004-0488, CAN-2004-0492), with no specific exploitation details for these specific CAN IDs. Attack vector: Remote attacker accessing web server.\n\n- **Xpm:** Stack and integer overflows when parsing malicious image files, possibly exploitable in applications handling XPM images, if ProPolice is bypassed. Attack vector: Malicious image file.\n\n- **login_radius:** Missing shared secret check, allows spoofing of replies, granting unauthorized access. Attack vector: Malicious RADIUS server.\n\n- **telnet:** Buffer overflows could allow arbitrary code execution. Attack vector: Malicious server or man-in-the-middle.\n\n- **copy:** Insufficient checks to prevent misuse. Attack vector: Not fully specified, but likely through misuse of the copy functions by a privileged attacker.\n\n- **httpd mod_include:** Buffer overflow when handling user-supplied tag strings.  Attack vector: Malicious document when server side includes are enabled or XBitHack enabled.\n\n- **isakmpd pfkey:** Local user can cause kernel memory corruption and system panic by setting IPsec credentials on a socket.  Attack vector: Local user.\n\n- **Impact:** The impact of these vulnerabilities range from denial of service (DoS), arbitrary code execution, to information disclosure.  \n\n",
