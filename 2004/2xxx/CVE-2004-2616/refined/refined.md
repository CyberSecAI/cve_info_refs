The provided content contains detailed information about multiple vulnerabilities in ActivePost Standard, a communication program for companies.

**Vulnerability 1: File-Server crash**
*   **Root cause:** The file server crashes when it receives a filename longer than 4074 characters.
*   **Weakness:** The file server lacks proper input validation for filenames.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to file server crash.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted filename during file upload.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can be remote, interacting with the server.

**Vulnerability 2: File-server directory traversal and path disclosure**
*  **Root cause:** Directory traversal vulnerability when processing the filename during upload.
*   **Weakness:**  Inadequate sanitization of the filename, allowing the use of directory traversal sequences (e.g., `/../`).
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary file upload and overwrite. Path disclosure, the attacker can see the full server path where the file was written.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting directory traversal using crafted filenames containing slashes (`/`) and `../` sequences.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker can upload malicious files to arbitrary locations on the server's disk.

**Vulnerability 3: Conference password disclosure**
*   **Root cause:** Plaintext conference passwords are sent to clients when they access the conference menu.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of encryption or secure handling of conference passwords.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to password-protected conferences.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sniffing network traffic between client and server.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the attacker to be in a position to intercept network traffic between a client and the ActivePost server when a client accesses the conference menu.

The document provides Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code for the first two vulnerabilities and instructions for observing the third vulnerability. The content also mentions that no fix was available and developers did not reply to the author.
