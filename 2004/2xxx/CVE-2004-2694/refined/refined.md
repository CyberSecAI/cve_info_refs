  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "A combination of HTML elements and attributes in an email allows the rendering of external or local content directly within the email message body instead of opening it in a separate browser.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The email client (Outlook Express 6.00) renders content within the email body instead of opening it in a separate browser.",
        "The application processes the 'BASE' tag which allows spoofing the apparent origin of the content.",
        "The application's security zone settings are used to process content within the email itself, which might not be sufficient to protect against malicious content."
      ],
      "impact": "Allows attackers to display malicious HTML content, including phishing pages, directly within an email message without the user's browser being opened. This could trick users into revealing sensitive information.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted HTML email message with a specific combination of tags and attributes.",
		"Utilizing the BASE tag to rewrite URLs and create a spoofed environment."
      ],
