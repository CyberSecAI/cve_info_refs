The provided content describes a vulnerability in Gadu-Gadu instant messenger related to long filenames.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly handle long filenames, specifically those crafted to include a deceptive file extension at the end after padding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **File extension spoofing:** The application displays a safe extension (e.g., .jpg) during file download, while the actual filename includes a malicious extension (e.g., .bat) after padding. This deceives users into thinking they are receiving a safe file.
- **Inadequate filename handling:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the filename, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious extension at the end through padding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By disguising a malicious executable (e.g., a .bat file) as a harmless file, an attacker can trick the user into running the executable, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
- **Compromise of user systems:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of a user's system, enabling attackers to perform various malicious activities (data theft, malware installation etc.)
- **Social engineering:** The vulnerability relies on social engineering to trick users into opening the malicious files.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Instant message file transfer:** The attacker sends a specially crafted file through the Gadu-Gadu instant messaging application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send files to a victim using the Gadu-Gadu instant messenger.
- The attacker needs to craft a file with a deceptive filename.
