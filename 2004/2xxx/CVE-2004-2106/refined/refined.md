The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Novell NetWare-Enterprise-Web-Server versions 5.1 and 6.0.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple instances of XSS vulnerabilities are identified due to unfiltered parameters in URLs. Attackers can inject arbitrary HTML and script code, which is then executed by the victim's browser.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Malicious URLs containing script tags within the URL paths or query parameters of requests. Specifically, the `/perl/` directory, `User.id` and `GWAP.version` parameters in `/servlet/webacc` requests, and the `/nsn/` directory are vulnerable.
*   **Local Path Disclosure:** The `cgi2perl` running on the server discloses local paths when accessing `/perl/\/.pl`.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specific URL request.
*   **Internal IP Disclosure:** Accessing specific URLs reveals internal IP addresses and server information.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing URLs such as `/examples/jsp/snp/snoop.jsp`, `/servlet/SnoopServlet`, `/nsn/env.bas`, and `/lcgi/lcgitest.nlm`.
*   **Loading .htt files:** The application can load `.htt` files via the `error` parameter in the `/servlet/webacc` URL.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Modifying the `error` parameter in a specific URL.
*   **Directory Listing:** Certain directories are exposed, revealing the file structure.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing URLs such as `/com/`, `/com/novell/`, `/com/novell/webaccess`, and `/ns-icons/`

**Root Cause:**

*   **XSS:** Lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding of user-supplied data in URLs. The server echoes the malicious code in its responses, leading to script execution in the user's browser.
*   **Local Path Disclosure:**  Insecure configuration or implementation of `cgi2perl` allows for the disclosure of server paths.
*   **Internal IP Disclosure:** Vulnerable JSP pages or servlets expose server information, including internal IPs.
*   **Loading .htt files:** Lack of input validation on the error parameter allows arbitrary files to be loaded.
*   **Directory Listing:** Improper configuration of the webserver that exposes directory structure.

**Impact:**

*   **XSS:** Attackers can manipulate web content, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, and potentially take actions on behalf of the victim user.
*   **Local Path Disclosure:** Attackers can gain insights into the server's file structure, which may lead to further attacks.
*   **Internal IP Disclosure:**  Attackers can gather sensitive information about the server and internal network structure.
*   **Loading .htt files:** Attackers can load local server files.
*   **Directory Listing:** Attackers can gain knowledge of the directory structure.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **No authentication is required** to exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker must craft specific URLs to trigger each vulnerability.
