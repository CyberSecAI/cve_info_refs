How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  Severity: High
     Title: phpMyAdmin: Vulnerability in MIME-based transformation
            system
      Date: October 18, 2004
      Bugs: #67409
        ID: 200410-14

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been found in the MIME-based transformation system
of phpMyAdmin, which may allow remote execution of arbitrary commands
if PHP's "safe mode" is disabled.

Background
==========

phpMyAdmin is a popular web-based MySQL administration tool written in
PHP. It allows users to browse and administer a MySQL database from a
web-browser. Transformations are a phpMyAdmin feature allowing plug-ins
to rewrite the contents of any column seen in phpMyAdmin's Browsing
mode, including using insertion of PHP or JavaScript code.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/phpmyadmin     < 2.6.0_p2                      >= 2.6.0_p2

Description
===========

A defect was found in phpMyAdmin's MIME-based transformation system,
when used with "external" transformations.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
commands on the server with the rights of the HTTP server user.

Workaround
==========

Enabling PHP safe mode ("safe_mode = On" in php.ini) may serve as a
temporary workaround.

Resolution
==========

All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.6.0_p2"
    # emerge ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.6.0_p2"

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been found in the MIME-based transformation system
of phpMyAdmin, which may allow remote execution of arbitrary commands
if PHP's "safe mode" is disabled.

Background
==========

phpMyAdmin is a popular web-based MySQL administration tool written in
PHP. It allows users to browse and administer a MySQL database from a
web-browser. Transformations are a phpMyAdmin feature allowing plug-ins
to rewrite the contents of any column seen in phpMyAdmin's Browsing
mode, including using insertion of PHP or JavaScript code.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/phpmyadmin     < 2.6.0_p2                      >= 2.6.0_p2

Description
===========

A defect was found in phpMyAdmin's MIME-based transformation system,
when used with "external" transformations.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
commands on the server with the rights of the HTTP server user.

Workaround
==========

Enabling PHP safe mode ("safe_mode = On" in php.ini) may serve as a
temporary workaround.

Resolution
==========

All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.6.0_p2"
    # emerge ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.6.0_p2"

### Summary

When specifying specially formatted options to external MIME
transformation, an attacker can execute any shell command restricted by
privileges of httpd user.

### Description

phpMyAdmin allows to use MIME transformations for displaying fields from
database. These transformations are not enabled by default
(administrator needs to prepare special table for keeping some
information and specify it in configuration). One of these
transformations allows to pipe field content through external program
which needs to be hardcoded in php script. However user can specify
parameters to that program and this parameter was not checked for shell
meta characters, so attacker could pass there anything from redirection
of output to executing any other command.

### Severity

In default setup this feature is not enabled and many hosting providers
run php in safe mode with disabled exec support, which both make them
unaffected by this issue. User also need to be logged in into
phpMyAdmin, what limites range of attackers to users of the server, who
usually also can execute php code directly, so this possibility doesn't
extend his privileges. However this could cause some harm, so we
consider this as important.

### Affected Versions

All releases starting with 2.5.0 up to and including 2.6.0-pl1.

### Unaffected Versions

All releases older than 2.5.0.
CVS HEAD has been fixed.
The upcoming 2.6.0-pl2 release.

### Solution

If you are vulnerable to this issue, easiest fix is to disable external
transformation - just remove file
libraries/transformations/text\_plain\_\_external.inc.php. The attached
patch fixes the problem but should only be used by distributors who do
not want to upgrade. Otherwise, we strongly advise everyone to upgrade
to CVS HEAD or to the next version of phpMyAdmin, which is to be
released soon.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Matthias Geerdsen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-13 09:25:42 UTC  ``` from release note:  This is patch level 2 of phpMyAdmin 2.6.0, containing a security fix and a few other fixes (see ChangeLog).    Security fix: If PHP is not running in safe mode, a problem in the MIME-based transformation system (with an "external" transformation) allows to execute any command with the privileges of the web server's user.  ______  <http://secunia.com/advisories/12813/>  Critical: Highly critical Impact:	System access Where:	From remote Solution Status:	Vendor Patch  Software:	phpMyAdmin 2.x   Description: A vulnerability has been reported in phpMyAdmin, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.  The vulnerability is caused due to a problem in the MIME-based transformation system with "external" transformations. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands.  Successful exploitation requires that PHP's safe mode is disabled.  Solution: Update to version 2.6.0-pl2. <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/>  Provided and/or discovered by: Reported by vendor.  __________________  twp, please bump the ebuild ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tom Payne (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-13 16:22:03 UTC  ``` OK, 2.6.0-pl2 in CVS, 2.6.0 removed. Not heavily tested. I'll close the bug in a couple of days unless there are reported problems. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-14 01:25:44 UTC  ``` Tom: please don't close the bug, we've still security work to do on it.  It's unclear if the vulnerability affects all phpmyadmin versions or just the 2.6.0 series. Could you look into it ? The stable keywords need is not the same in each case... ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Matthias Geerdsen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-14 02:36:01 UTC  ``` according to <http://www.heise.de/security/news/meldung/52132> (german) all versions since 2.5 are affected, since the transformation system (<http://www.phpmyadmin.net/documentation/#transformations>) has been implemented there for the first time ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-14 02:43:13 UTC  ``` OK, then we need to keyword it stable as in 2.5.7_p1. Arches, please test and mark dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.6.0_p2 stable   ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Jochen Maes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-14 03:05:58 UTC  ``` stable on ppc ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Guy Martin (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-14 04:38:59 UTC  ``` Stable on hppa. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Jason Wever (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-14 20:48:31 UTC  ``` Stable on sparc ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Bryan Østergaard (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-15 03:36:00 UTC  ``` Stable on alpha. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-16 03:35:59 UTC  ``` GLSA drafted, blocked by amd64 missing keyword. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Danny van Dyk (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-16 07:33:17 UTC  ``` stable on amd64. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-18 05:11:45 UTC  ``` GLSA 200410-14 ``` |  |
