Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2004-2630:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in phpMyAdmin's MIME-based transformation system, specifically when used with "external" transformations. The application did not properly sanitize user-provided parameters to an external program, allowing shell meta-characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is a command injection flaw. By injecting shell meta-characters into the parameters of an external program called by phpMyAdmin's transformation feature, an attacker could execute arbitrary shell commands.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application failed to sanitize user-supplied input before passing it to the external command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker would execute commands with the privileges of the HTTP server user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable through the web interface of phpMyAdmin.
- **MIME-based transformations:** The attack is specifically targeted at the MIME transformation feature of phpMyAdmin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to phpMyAdmin:** The attacker must have access to a phpMyAdmin instance where the vulnerable MIME transformation feature is enabled.
- **PHP Safe Mode Disabled:** The vulnerability is exploitable if PHP's safe mode is disabled.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects phpMyAdmin versions from 2.5.0 up to and including 2.6.0-pl1.
- The "external" transformation feature is not enabled by default.
- A temporary workaround is to enable PHP's safe mode.
- The vulnerability is also identified as PMASA-2004-2.
- The vulnerability is resolved in phpMyAdmin version 2.6.0-pl2.
