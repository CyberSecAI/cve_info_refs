Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Tiny Server 1.1 (1.0.5), as described by the researcher:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** Inadequate input validation on user-supplied file paths, specifically not handling ".." sequences.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Lack of proper input string validation and handling, leading to crashes with malformed requests.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied strings, allowing them to be embedded into HTML responses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal (Path Traversal):** The server does not properly sanitize or validate file path inputs.
*   **Denial of Service:** The server crashes when it receives malformed HTTP requests (missing HTTP version, or extremely long request).
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The server does not sanitize user input before reflecting it back in the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** Attackers can read and download arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can crash the server, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the server's responses.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** Sending a crafted URL containing ".." sequences, e.g. `http://[host]/../../windows/system.ini`.
*   **Denial of Service:** Sending malformed HTTP requests like `GET /index.htm` (without HTTP/1.1), `index.htm` or `GET /aaaaaa[260 of a]aaa HTTP/1.1` .
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Embedding HTML code into the URL e.g. `http://[host]/<script>alert("Test")</script>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have network access to the Tiny Server.
*   For Directory Traversal, XSS and DoS, the attacker only needs to send specifically crafted HTTP requests to the server.

**Additional Notes**

*   The researcher indicates that no fix is available because the vendor didn't respond to the vulnerability reports.
*   The provided examples are effective in demonstrating each vulnerability.
