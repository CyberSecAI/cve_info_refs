Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from Gallery's flawed attempt to simulate the behavior of PHP's `register_globals` setting when it is disabled. This simulation involves extracting values from `$HTTP_` global variables into the global namespace. Insufficient checks were implemented to sanitize the extracted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Inadequate Input Validation:** The code fails to properly validate the data extracted from HTTP global variables before using them in the global namespace.
- **`register_globals` Simulation Flaw:** The method used to mimic `register_globals` is susceptible to manipulation by overwriting critical variables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** By crafting a malicious URL, an attacker can overwrite the `$HTTP_POST_VARS` variable. When this variable is subsequently extracted, a payload can be injected.
- **Server Compromise:** If the injected payload manipulates the `$GALLERY_BASEDIR` variable, the attacker can achieve PHP injection and gain remote access to the webserver.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains access with the same privileges as the webserver/PHP user ID.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted URL, specifically using a `GET` request to `init.php` with the `HTTP_POST_VARS` parameter set to a malicious value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter (`HTTP_POST_VARS`) and how to craft the URL.

**More Details Than CVE:**

The provided content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including:

-   Specific vulnerable versions (1.3.1, 1.3.2, 1.3.3, 1.4, and 1.4.1).
