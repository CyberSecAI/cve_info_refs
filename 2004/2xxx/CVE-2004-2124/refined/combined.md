# Gallery 1.4.1 and below remote exploit vulnerability — GLSA **200402-04**

The Gallery developers have discovered a potentially serious security flaw
in Gallery 1.3.1, 1.3.2, 1.3.3, 1.4 and 1.4.1 which can allow a
remote exploit of your webserver.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/gallery** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.1\_p1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.1\_p1** |

### Background

Gallery is an open source image management system written in PHP.
More information is available at http://gallery.sourceforge.net

### Description

Starting in the 1.3.1 release, Gallery includes code to simulate the behaviour
of the PHP 'register\_globals' variable in environments where that setting
is disabled. It is simulated by extracting the values of the various
$HTTP\_ global variables into the global namespace.

### Impact

A crafted URL such as
http://example.com/gallery/init.php?HTTP\_POST\_VARS=xxx causes the
'register\_globals' simulation code to overwrite the $HTTP\_POST\_VARS which,
when it is extracted, will deliver the given payload. If the
payload compromises $GALLERY\_BASEDIR then the malicious user can perform a
PHP injection exploit and gain remote access to the webserver with PHP
user UID access rights.

### Workaround

The workaround for the vulnerability is to replace init.php and
setup/init.php with the files in the following ZIP file:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gallery/patch\_1.4.1-to-1.4.1-pl1.zip?download

### Resolution

All users are encouraged to upgrade their gallery installation:

```
 # emerge sync
 # emerge -p ">=www-apps/gallery-1.4.1_p1"
 # emerge ">=www-apps/gallery-1.4.1_p1"
```

 and alerting us before posting )

___________________
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Gallery is an open source image management system written in PHP.
Learn more about it at <http://gallery.sourceforge.net>

Starting in release 1.3.1, Gallery includes code to simulate the
behaviour of register_globals in environments where that setting
is disabled.  We do this by extracting the values of the various
$HTTP_ global variables into the global namespace.  We check
for the presence of certain types of malicious data before doing
this, but our checks are inadequate.

A clever hacker can circumvent our checks by crafting a URL like
this:

    <http://example.com/gallery/init.php?HTTP_POST_VARS=xxx>

this causes our register_global simulation code to overwrite
the HTTP_POST_VARS which, when it in turn is extracted will
deliver the payload.  If the payload compromises $GALLERY_BASEDIR
then the malicious user can perform a PHP injection exploit and
gain remote access to your box as the webserver/PHP user id.

_________________
VERSIONS AFFECTED

This vulnerability affects Gallery releases 1.3.1, 1.3.2, 1.3.3,
1.4 and 1.4.1.  It has been fixed in Gallery v1.4.1-pl1, v1.4.2
(not yet released) and in the CVS HEAD.  We strongly recommend
that all users upgrade to Gallery v1.4.1-pl1 ASAP.

__________________
FIXING THE PROBLEM

There are three different ways you can resolve this problem.

1.  Replace init.php and setup/init.php with the files from this zip:

<http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gallery/patch_1.4.1-to-1.4.1-pl1.zip?download>

     -or-

2.  Upgrade to Gallery 1.4.1-pl1:

<http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7130&package_id=7239&release_id=212324>

    -or-

3.  Follow the instructions in this news article:
      <http://gallery.sourceforge.net/article.php?sid=107>
    to manually patch the two affected files.  (won't take more
    than a couple of minutes).

regards,
Bharat Mediratta
Gallery developer

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
