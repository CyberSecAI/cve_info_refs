```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `show.pl` script in RiSearch and RiSearch Pro does not properly restrict access to URLs provided in the `url` parameter, allowing attackers to specify arbitrary URLs.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Open HTTP/FTP proxy: The script can be used to proxy requests to arbitrary web servers and FTP servers.",
    "Directory listing: The script can list directory contents via `file:` URLs.",
    "File disclosure: The script can read arbitrary files via `file:` URLs."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can use the vulnerable script as an open proxy to access other web servers on the internet, internal networks and also access services behind a firewall. An attacker can also enumerate directories and read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem, potentially exposing sensitive information such as OS password files.",
  "Attack vectors": "The primary attack vector is by manipulating the `url` parameter in the `show.pl` script through HTTP GET or POST requests.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only requires network access to the vulnerable server running RiSearch. No authentication or specific positioning within the network is required to exploit the vulnerability."
