IRM Security Advisory No. 009

	RiSearch and RiSearch ProPro are vulnerable to open FTP/HTTP proxy,
	directory listings and file disclosure vulnerabilities

	Vulnerablity Type / Importance: Network Subversion,
					Open Proxy, Brute-Force Attack

	Arbitrary Filesystem Access / High

	Problem discovered: July 6th 2004
	Vendor contacted: July 7th 2004
	Advisory published: July 27th 2004

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Abstract:
~~~~~~~~~

	The RiSearch (and Pro) Suite is a set of PERL scripts that enables
users to search web sites.  RiSearch (Pro) is vulnerable to an open proxy
attack that allows arbitrary access to ports via FTP and HTTP as well as
access to the remote file system (files and directory listings) outside the
web root.

Description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

	During a recent security testing engagement it was identified that
public access was granted to a script show.pl, which grabs a web page and
highlights words in it based on POST/GET variables. The functionality was
originally
designed to show and highlight pages from the target web site only.

However it was identified that no access restrictions were applied to
the script and it was possible to manipulate the variables to make requests
to
other sites, ports and files.  For example, one could select: -

<http://10.0.0.0/cgi-bin/search/show.pl?url=http://www.google.com>

and the site would return the Google web site. Unfortunately this means
that the server is now an open proxy, and it is possible to utilise the
script
to access web servers on the net and masquerade behind the target's site,
which is very useful for analysing/attacking other servers using web
protocols.

Furthermore, it is also possible to request web sites from private IP
addresses behind the firewall, for example: -

<http://10.0.0.0/cgi-bin/search/show.pl?url=http://192.168.0.1>

or from another port (in this case a Tomcat admin page): -

<http://10.0.0.0/cgi-bin/search/show.pl?url=http://localhost:8080>

This seriously circumvents the security of any firewall infrastructure
in place protecting the hosts.

It was also observed that it was possible to gain access to services
using the FTP protocol using: -

<http://10.0.0.0/cgi-bin/search/show.pl?url=ftp://192.168.0.1>

Again, potentially compromising any access restrictions in place at the
network layer. It is also possible to use the script to brute-force FTP
accounts behind the firewall using the following: -

<http://10.0.0.0/cgi-bin/search/show.pl?url=ftp://username:password@192.168.0>
.1

Finally, it transpires that it is also possible to read any file on the
filesystem using the following URL: -

<http://10.0.0.0/cgi-bin/search/show.pl?url=file:/etc/passwd>

This would show the Operating System password file. Requesting only a
directory provides a handy listing.

Tested Versions:
~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~

	RiSearch 1.0.01
	RiSearch Pro 3.2.06

Tested Operating Systems:
~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~

	Microsoft Windows 2000

Vendor & Patch Information:
~~~~~~ ~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~

	RiSearch were contacted on July 7th 2004 and released the update on
July 8th 2004, which can be downloaded from <http://www.risearch.org>

Workarounds:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Deny browser access to show.pl

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
