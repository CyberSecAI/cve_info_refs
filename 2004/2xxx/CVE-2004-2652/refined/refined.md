{
  "CVE-2004-2652": {
    "Description": "The provided content describes a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in Snort, specifically when running with “FAST” output or in verbose mode. This aligns with the provided CVE description.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from an error in the `DecodeTCPOptions` function, where the `opt_count` is incremented prematurely. When printing TCP options via `PrintTcpOptions`, this leads to a null pointer dereference, causing the crash.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Null Pointer Dereference",
      "Improper handling of TCP option processing"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) - The Snort process crashes, interrupting network monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted network packets with specific TCP options trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to send network traffic to a host running Snort with verbose logging enabled or in FAST output mode.  No special privileges are required beyond the ability to send network traffic to a target."
