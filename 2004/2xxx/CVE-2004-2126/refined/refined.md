Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `packetLog` functionality of the `blackd.exe` service within BlackICE. This overflow is triggered when a long string is provided as the `packetLog.fileprefix` value in the `blackice.ini` configuration file.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `packetLog` function of the `blackd.exe` service. This service runs with SYSTEM privileges.
    *   **Insecure File Permissions:** After upgrading BlackICE to version 3.6cbz, the permissions of the `.ini` configuration files (`blackice.ini`, `firewall.ini`, `protect.ini`, `sigs.ini`) are changed to allow full control to everyone, which is a downgrade compared to the original installation where only Administrator had full control.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `blackd.exe` service fails to properly validate the length of the `packetLog.fileprefix` string before copying it into a fixed-size buffer.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a local user to gain SYSTEM privileges. By overwriting the EIP and ECX registers, arbitrary code can be executed with SYSTEM privileges.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Exploit:** A local user can exploit the vulnerability by modifying the `blackice.ini` file with a crafted `packetLog.fileprefix` value. Once BlackICE detects a file change or when any alert is triggered, the `blackd.exe` service will crash, allowing execution of the injected code as system.
    *   **Remote Exploitation (indirect):** While the vulnerability itself is local, the advisory mentions that it can be triggered remotely through the use of a malicious `blackice.ini` file being delivered by other vulnerabilities. The advisory provides an example of using an Internet Explorer vulnerability to overwrite the `blackice.ini` using a VBScript.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local Access:** Initially, an attacker needs local access to the target machine (either directly or remotely via a tool like VNC) with a valid user account.
    *   **File Write Access:** After the BlackICE upgrade, any user can write to the ini files, including `blackice.ini`.

* **Additional Details**
    * The advisory provides the specific `ini` options that trigger the overflow:
    ```ini
    [Packet Logging]
    packetLog.logging=enabled
    packetLog.fileprefix=<aaaaa...b0f here...aaaaa>
    packetLog.maxKbytes=2048
    packetLog.maxfiles=10
    ```
    * A 217-character log prefix is mentioned as being sufficient to cause the crash, and allow for EIP and ECX to be overwritten.
    * The advisory also notes that enabling BlackICE's Application Protection feature mitigates this vulnerability, as it prevents the configuration files from being modified.

This advisory provides more technical detail than the official CVE description by providing the exact conditions and configuration options needed to exploit the vulnerability and how the exploit can be used to gain system privileges.
