    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2004-2449",
      "vuln_type": "Crash with malformed UDP packet",
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of crafted UDP packets in RogerWilco's audio stream processing.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient bounds checking when reading target IDs from a UDP packet",
         "Lack of validation on the number of target IDs specified in the packet compared to the packet size"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service. Sending a malformed UDP packet to RogerWilco's UDP audio port will crash the server or client application.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote: Sending a specially crafted UDP packet to the target application's audio port"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to send UDP packets to the targeted server or client"
      ],
        "details": "A large channel name (e.g., 924 characters) is sent in a UDP packet, followed by an indication of a large number of target IDs (e.g., 127), but without including the corresponding ID data, the application will read from a non-allocated memory zone (ESI pointer), leading to a crash. The vulnerability exists in the RWNET.DLL on the server and NETWORK.DLL on the GUI application."

        "cve_id": "CVE-2004-2449",
        "vuln_type": "\"Voices from the deep\" bug",
        "root_cause": "Lack of proper authentication and authorization for UDP audio stream transmission in RogerWilco.",
         "weaknesses": [
          "The audio stream transmission (UDP) is not tied to the user connection (TCP).",
            "Lack of authentication and authorization on the UDP audio stream."
        ],
        "impact": "Unauthorized audio transmission. An attacker can transmit audio into a channel without being a member, bypassing server access restrictions.",

          "Remote: Sending UDP audio data to a server or a client without proper authentication."
        ],

          "Knowledge of user IDs in the target channel"
        ],
        "details": "An attacker can send an audio stream to a specific channel on a RogerWilco server or a specific user within the channel by sending UDP packets directly without being connected or authenticated through the TCP connection, circumventing access controls. While receiving audio is not possible, transmitting audio is possible without any restrictions and also if a channel is password protected."

      "root_cause": "Information leakage of IP addresses and other user details via TCP messages.",
       "weaknesses": [
          "Unnecessary disclosure of IP addresses and port information in server-to-client and client-to-client communications.",
            "Exposing user IP addresses and ports through a TCP based message which is accessible to users in the same channel."
        ],
      "impact": "Privacy violation. Users' IP addresses and port numbers are exposed, enabling targeting or deanonymization.",

        "Passive: Intercepting TCP messages to obtain IP addresses and ports",
         "Active: Using leaked information to target other users in a channel."

      "attacker_capabilities": [
        "Being a member of the target channel within RogerWilco"
      ],
        "details": "Both the server and the client reveal user IP addresses and port numbers via TCP messages when a user joins a channel (server), or when connecting to a client (client). The server sends the IP addresses and ports of the users in the channel via tag `0x0f0f`. Clients also receive the server's IP via tag `0x010f`. This information can be used by malicious users to target another user."

          "vuln_type": "Annoying attacks",
          "root_cause": "Lack of proper handling of incomplete TCP connections and excessive GUI refreshes.",
           "weaknesses": [
              "Server displays 'nothing read from recv' message for empty TCP connections.",

             "Ability to send nickname change messages on the client."
           ],
           "details": "Empty TCP connections cause the server to display the message 'nothing read from recv'. Repeated empty connections can flood the server's administrator with these messages and create annoyance. The GUI program refreshes its entire window when a user changes their nickname. If a user changes their nickname continuously, it can make the application unresponsive for other users in the same channel, creating a denial of service."
