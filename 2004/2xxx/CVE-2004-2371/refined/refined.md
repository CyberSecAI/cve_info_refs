  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the game handles text strings. Each string is preceded by a 32-bit number indicating its size. When the server or client receives data, it uses functions to manage these size numbers and the following data. However, the return values of these functions are not checked. This lack of validation leads to exceptions, specifically a crash at the instruction \"mov byte ptr [eax], 00\" when EAX is 0x00000000.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Lack of return value checks",
      "Null pointer dereference"

    "impact": "The vulnerability leads to a crash. The system appears unrecoverable after the crash, requiring a reboot.",
