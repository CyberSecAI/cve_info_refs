Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2004-2746:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied username and password data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89). The application fails to properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain administrative access to the application. This allows the attacker to perform any action an administrator can, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located within the login functionality at `http://[host]/photoalbum/admin/adminlogin.asp`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker only needs network access to the application to exploit this vulnerability. No special access or privileges are needed prior to exploitation.
- The attack is performed remotely and does not require local access to the system.
-The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious crafted login credentials at the login form.

**Technical Details:**
- By providing `'or'` as both the username and password (e.g., Username: `'or'`, Password: `'or'`), an attacker can bypass the authentication checks in the SQL query.
- The SQL query is likely structured in a way that a user/password of 'or' will result in a logically TRUE condition, allowing for access even without valid credentials.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable application is Xtreme ASP Photo Gallery version 2.0.
- A security advisory was released by Tripbit Security with ID TA-150104 on January 15th, 2004
