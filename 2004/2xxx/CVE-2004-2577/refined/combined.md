| [Sun 18 Jan 2004 05:49:11 AM UTC, comment #2:](#comment2)   This has been corrected in CVS.   To grab a complete update of all fixes:   1)  Check to see if you have cvs installed: 'cvs --help'.  1a) If not, install a copy of cvs-cli from your favorite  distro.   2)  Then just type:      'cd <your phpgroupware dir>; cvs update -dP'.   You can do step 2 as many times in a day as you wish, and  will always get the most current bug fixes.   Thanks, | [Dave Hall <skwashd>](/users/skwashd) Group administrator |
| [Tue 13 Jan 2004 02:33:11 PM UTC, comment #1:](#comment1)   *[patch #2472](/patch/?2472)* solve this problem in class.vfs\_dav.inc.php   regards,  Caeies. | [Caeies <Caeies>](/users/Caeies) Group administrator |
| [Tue 13 Jan 2004 02:27:58 PM UTC, **original submission:**](#comment0)   I don't know If you remember this. So I post it on the savannah bug tracker (from forums.phpgroupware.org).   so, at line 804 in acl\_check you will see a return True; (this is the beginning of the function). So acl\_check always return True ... This could be ok if .htaccess are created correctly by mkdir which is not the case (see the next bug).   The workaround is the following :  1) remove the return True; at line 804  2) then before the ls at line ~880 override the acl and restore them just after.   et voila :) acl\_check are working now under dav system.  Caeies.  PS: patch posted in a few minute. | [Caeies <Caeies>](/users/Caeies) Group administrator |
