phorum5/trunk/mods/event\_logging/db.php, phorum5/trunk/pm.php: #
Changed the order output hooks to do before\_footer\_ and then
# before\_footer instead of the other way around. This makes the
output # hook order more logical (after header ->
after\_header\_ -> # before\_footer\_, before\_footer). #
Also a bit of cleanup on 5.3 hook calls that didn't use
phorum\_api\_hook().
2010-10-26 13:58 mmakaay

phorum5/trunk/mods/bbcode/api.php: # Made it possible to grab the
$message data by reference from a BBcode # handler callback. I
thought it was already working, but I need to # explicitly setup

\* phorum5/branches/phorum\_5\_2/include/api/image.php,
phorum5/trunk/include/api/image.php: # The "imagick" scaling

phorum5/branches/phorum\_5\_2/mods/bbcode/api.php,
phorum5/branches/phorum\_5\_2/mods/bbcode/bbcode.php: Changes in the
BBcode callback handling, to provide callback handlers with the
message that is being parsed. This way, the callback code can
perform actions that need to be context-aware. Also, deprecated
the use of dl() calls in the http\_get and image APIs. This is done
because of the following warning on the PHP site: "This function
has been removed from some SAPI's in PHP 5.3"

the page jump down when the user click "Reply" and the "Sorry,
only registered users may post in this forum" message is showing

\* phorum5/branches/phorum\_5\_2/feed.php, phorum5/trunk/feed.php:
Feeds were not disabled when disabling them from the admin
interface settings. They were only hidden from the templates.
Therefore calling the feed script to load feed data still worked.
This bug is fixed by this release. When disabling the feed option,
the feed.php script will block access to the feeds too now.

phorum5/trunk/include/controlcenter/user.php: Various fixes for
(minor) security related issues. \* Fixed the possibility of
bypassing the email address validation checks and confirmation
code via email for email address changes through the control
center. Risk: the user could change his own email address to some
fake address, because the email validation step was skipped.
(thanks to Carlos Ghan for pointing out this issue) \* XSS issue
for the email address change panel in the control center fixed.
The previous fix already prevents this, because the user can no
longer inject a false email address with HTML code in it. The
email settings panel prevents that. Still, we added an extra layer
of XSS protection to the control center code. Risk: the XSS issue
was only triggered for the user himself, within his own control
center. The email address in the public user profile was already
XSS-protected. (thanks to Carlos Ghan for pointing out this issue)
\* Fixed the possibility of bypassing the original password check
when changing the password through the control center. Risk: this
might be used by a malicious user to change the password for a
user that is logged into Phorum on a computer that the malicious
user has direct access to (e.g. a computer in a library or
internet cafe, where the user forgot to logout). \* Fixed an XSS
issue in the personal file management panel in the control center.
By uploading a file with a specially crafted filename, HTML code
could be injected in the file management page. Risk: the XSS issue
was only triggered for the user himself, within his own control
center.

phorum5/trunk/mods/event\_logging/settings/settings.php: - Added a
new logged event: User requests a new password. Thanks to CBiLL
for the idea. This feature requires a new hook that is only
available in Phorum 5.2.13 and up. - Modified the failed login
event: if the username that was used is known to Phorum, then the
user\_id is set for the event. This way, failed login events can be
filtered by the username as long as an existing username was used.
Thanks to CBiLL for the idea. - Fixed a bug: with event logging
programmatically suspended, not all hooks returned the correct
data. This feature is not widely used (if at all), so there is no
real user impact.

\* phorum5/branches/phorum\_5\_2/common.php: Backported the
phorum\_switch\_template() function from trunk to 5.2. This new
function makes it possible to switch the active Phorum template to
a template that is stored in any directory. This is for example
useful if a module includes a full Phorum template, where the
template is packaged with the module code. With this new function,
the Phorum can activate the module's template without the need for
the admin to copy the template to the main templates directory.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
