{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vsftpd daemon was calling non-reentrant functions `malloc()` and `free()` within the SIGCHLD signal handler. When the signal interrupted these calls within the `accept()` function, a deadlock could occur, causing the service to stop accepting connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of non-reentrant functions (malloc, free) within signal handlers",
      "Improper signal blocking/unblocking around blocking system calls"
    ],
    "impact": "The vsftpd service could stop accepting new connections, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "Heavy network traffic to the vsftpd server, triggering the SIGCHLD signal handler at inopportune times.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would not need any special capabilities, just the ability to make many connections to the server, causing the vulnerable signal handling code to be triggered. This is a classic DoS scenario."
  },
  "additional_details": {
      "patch_details": "The vulnerability was addressed in vsftpd version 1.2.2 by rewriting structures to avoid malloc and free calls within the accept routine. The fix was backported to the 1.2.1 series in version 1.2.1-4.",
      "affected_products": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 3 on various architectures (x86_64, ia64, i386, s390x, s390, ppc)",
       "related_bugs": [
        "Bug 109933: vsftpd listener hangs",
          "Bug 113364: FTP service stops when heavy traffic load on vsftpd lasts long time",
          "Bug 119136: vsftpd is very secure but not very stable"
