Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the relevant vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2004-2536 (This CVE is a placeholder and doesn't have a description)

Based on the provided content, this CVE is most likely related to the "Can not mount from cifs vfs client built with gcc 3.3.1 due to compiler optimization of unsafe global variable. Remove unsafe global variable."

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A global variable used within the CIFS VFS client code was being incorrectly optimized by the gcc 3.3.1 compiler. This compiler optimization caused the global variable to be unsafe, leading to issues with mounting CIFS shares.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsafe global variable: The use of a global variable in a way that is susceptible to compiler optimizations that break intended program logic.
- Compiler-specific behavior: Dependence on a specific compiler version and its optimization behavior, indicating a lack of robustness in the code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Inability to mount CIFS shares: The primary impact is that clients using a version of the CIFS VFS client that was compiled using gcc 3.3.1 would be unable to mount file systems, disrupting network access to shared resources.
- Potential instability: Unspecified consequences stemming from the unsafe global variable being manipulated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- No direct attack vector is described. This is a bug that manifests itself when mounting network drives using a specific version of the code.
- The vulnerability is in the client software, so would affect anyone using a client built with the affected compiler.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- There is no need for an attacker for this vulnerability to be present. It arises from the software interacting with the compiler.
- The user would need to be running a Linux system compiled with gcc 3.3.1 that mounts CIFS file systems.

**Additional Notes:**

- The text notes that an unsafe global variable is removed, indicating that the vulnerability was addressed in later versions.
- The content describes a compilation issue, not a runtime issue, which means that exploitation would be due to using the incorrect version of the code, rather than by a remote attack.

This content provides a good amount of detail about the vulnerability, its root cause, and its impact. It is more specific than what you might typically expect from a CVE description.
