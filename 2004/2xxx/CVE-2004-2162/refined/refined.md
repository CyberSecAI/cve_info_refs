Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2004-2162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in two areas of the tutos application:
  1. The search function of the address book.
  2. The `app_new.php` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities allows an attacker to execute arbitrary web script code within the context of the user's browser. This could lead to:
  * Stealing user session cookies.
  * Redirecting users to malicious sites.
  * Performing actions on behalf of the user.
  * Defacing the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors involve injecting malicious JavaScript code through:
  1. The search field within the address book.
  2. Input parameters of the `app_new.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  * The attacker needs the ability to introduce malicious script code via user-supplied data that is not properly sanitized by the application.
  * No special privileges within the application seem to be needed to exploit this vulnerability.
  * The attacker does not need physical access to the server.
  * The attack is launched remotely via the web browser.
