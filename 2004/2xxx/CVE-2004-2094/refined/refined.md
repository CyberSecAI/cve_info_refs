- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WebcamXP server does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the URL, allowing the injection of arbitrary scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary scripts on the user's browser. This can be used to perform Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks or other actions against local users, potentially leveraging other vulnerabilities in the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a URL that includes malicious JavaScript and sending it to a victim.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URL to the victim, who must then access the URL through their browser. This can be achieved through various methods, such as email, links on web pages, or social engineering techniques.
