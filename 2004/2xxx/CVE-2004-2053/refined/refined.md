- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application allows inclusion of external code by using the `site` parameter in `index.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted external code inclusion vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server by providing a URL to malicious code via the `site` parameter.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a URL with the `site` parameter pointing to a malicious script hosted on an external server, an attacker can inject and execute code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable server and needs access to an external server to host malicious code.
