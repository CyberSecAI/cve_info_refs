Affected software description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Php-Nuke is a popular freeware content management system, written in php by
Francisco Burzi. This CMS (Content Management System) is used on many thousands
websites, because it's freeware, easy to install and has broad set of features.

Homepage: <http://phpnuke.org>

Vulnerabilities:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So PhpNuke version 7.3 is out allready and has improved by security means.
Anyway, i have found many unpublished security flaws in it, not fixed yet in 7.3
version and one security hole is brandnew -  from integrated nukecops union tap ;)
Time is money, so let's start our journey to PhpNuke's (in)security world...

A. Full path disclosure:

A1 - full path disclosure through unsanitized variable "show" in "WebLinks" module:

<http://localhost/nuke73/modules.php?name=Web_Links&l_op=viewlink&cid=1&show=foobar>

Warning: Division by zero in D:\apache_wwwroot\nuke73\modules\Web_Links\index.php on \
line 774

B. Cross-site scripting aka XSS:

B1 - XSS through uninitialized variable "optionbox" in "News" module:

<http://localhost/nuke73/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1&optionbox=>[xss code \
here]

B2 - XSS through unsanitized variable "date" in "Statistics" module:

<http://localhost/nuke73/modules.php?name=Statistics&op=DailyStats&year=2004&month=5&date=>[xss \
code here]

B3 - XSS through unsanitized variables in "Stories_Archive" module:

<http://localhost/nuke73/modules.php?name=Stories_Archive&sa=show_month&year=>[xss code \
here]&month=05&month_l=May \
<http://localhost/nuke73/modules.php?name=Stories_Archive&sa=show_month&year=2004&month=>[xss \
code here]&month_l=May \
<http://localhost/nuke73/modules.php?name=Stories_Archive&sa=show_month&year=2004&month=05&month_l=>[xss \
code here]

B4 - XSS through unsanitized variables in "Surveys" module:

<http://localhost/nuke73/modules.php?name=Surveys&file=comments&op=Reply&pid=1&pollID=1&mode=>[xss \
code here]&order=0&thold=0 \
<http://localhost/nuke73/modules.php?name=Surveys&file=comments&op=Reply&pid=1&pollID=1&mode=thread&order=>[xss \
code here]&thold=0 <http://localhost/nuke73/modules.php?name=Surveys&file=comments&op=Reply&pid=1&pollID=1&mode=thread&order=&thold=>[xss \
code here]

B5 - XSS through nukecops UnionTap Sql Prevention Code:

//Union Tap
//Copyright Zhen-Xjell 2004 <http://nukecops.com>
//Beta 3 Code to prevent UNION SQL Injections
unset($matches);
unset($loc);
if (preg_match("/([OdWo5NIbpuU4V2iJT0n]{5}) /", \
rawurldecode($loc=$_SERVER["QUERY_STRING"]), $matches)) {  die("YOU ARE SLAPPED BY <a \
href=\"<http://nukecops.com\>">NUKECOPS</a> BY USING '$matches[1]' INSIDE '$loc'."); }

So this clever code will catch up nonmasked sql injection attempts, made through \
"GET" request... Let's try this request:

<http://localhost/nuke73/index.php?foo=bar%20union%20select>

and we see nice message like this:

YOU ARE SLAPPED BY NUKECOPS BY USING 'union' INSIDE 'foo=bar%20union%20select'.

But what, if we issue request like this (try it with M$ Internet Explorer for \
succes!):

<http://localhost/nuke73/index.php?foo=bar%20union%20select%20&lt;script&gt;alert>(document.cookie);&lt;/script&gt;

Oops, nice case of cross-site scripting! And because anti-xss filtering code is \
located  AFTER UnionTap, then we can use even most common "&lt;script&gt;" tags...

```
The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in PhpNuke versions 6.x to 7.3.

**A. Full Path Disclosure:**

*   **Root Cause:**  Improper sanitization of the `show` variable in the `WebLinks` module.
*   **Vulnerability:** Full path disclosure.
*   **Impact:** The webserver's full file path is revealed in the error message, which could expose sensitive information about the server's infrastructure.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request to the `WebLinks` module with a specific `show` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capability:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable webserver.

**B. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:** Multiple instances of unsanitized or uninitialized variables within various PhpNuke modules.
*   **Vulnerabilities:** Multiple XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted GET requests to various modules with malicious code injected into specific parameters:
    *   `News` module - `optionbox` parameter
    *   `Statistics` module - `date` parameter
    *   `Stories_Archive` module - `year`, `month`, and `month_l` parameters
    *   `Surveys` module - `mode`, `order`, and `thold` parameters
    *   `index.php` through the UnionTap SQL prevention mechanism.
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server, and entice users to click on the crafted URLs.

**Specific details for XSS in UnionTap Prevention Code:**

*   **Root Cause:** The UnionTap code, designed to prevent SQL injection by blocking specific keywords like "union," does not properly filter or sanitize the input, and is performed before anti-XSS filtering
*   **Vulnerability:** XSS due to the order of sanitization and the simplistic check for specific keywords.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript by including XSS code within the URL which bypasses the UnionTap code and the default filters.
*   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a URL with a "union select" string followed by XSS code.
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server, and induce users to click on the crafted links. The attack is specifically effective on Microsoft Internet Explorer due to its specific handling of the crafted URL.
