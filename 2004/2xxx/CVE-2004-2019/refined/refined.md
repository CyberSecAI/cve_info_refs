The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in PhpNuke versions 6.x to 7.3, as detailed in the advisory [waraxe-2004-SA#030].

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**
- **Full Path Disclosure:** Unsanitized variable "show" in the "WebLinks" module leads to a PHP error revealing the server's file path.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    - Uninitialized variable "optionbox" in the "News" module.
    - Unsanitized variable "date" in the "Statistics" module.
    - Unsanitized variables in the "Stories_Archive" module.
    - Unsanitized variables in the "Surveys" module.
    - Flaw in the "Nukecops Union Tap" SQL injection prevention code where XSS is possible due to the filtering occurring after the UnionTap check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Full Path Disclosure:** Lack of sanitization of user input leads to exposure of server file paths.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    - Improper handling of user-supplied input in various modules leading to XSS.
    - Vulnerable regular expression logic for SQL injection prevention.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Path Disclosure:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's directory structure, potentially aiding further attacks.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript in a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, and other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Full Path Disclosure:**  By manipulating the "show" parameter in the "WebLinks" module URL.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    - By injecting malicious code into specific URL parameters in the "News", "Statistics", "Stories_Archive" and "Surveys" modules, like `optionbox`, `date`, `year`, `month`, `month_l`, `mode`, `order`, and `thold`.
     - By injecting malicious Javascript through the URL parameter, which bypasses the "Nukecops Union Tap" filter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs containing the exploit payloads and direct victims to access those URLs.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, this is a pre-authentication attack vector.
