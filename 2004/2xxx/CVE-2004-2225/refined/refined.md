Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-2225:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handled saving files downloaded via the `data:` protocol, specifically when a filename was not explicitly provided. When saving such files, the download manager incorrectly treated the target directory as the file itself. This led to a recursive deletion of the directory contents when the download was canceled, due to the use of `Remove(PR_TRUE)` function which deletes recursively. Files were only preserved if they were marked as read-only.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect File Handling:** The download manager failed to properly handle files from the `data:` protocol that lacked explicit filenames, leading it to treat the destination directory as the file.
*   **Recursive Deletion:**  The use of `Remove(PR_TRUE)` resulted in the recursive deletion of the target directory when a download was canceled, instead of just deleting a single file.
*   **Lack of User Prompts:** The absence of a file picker or prompt for a filename when saving `data:` URLs contributed to the issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Loss:** Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to the complete deletion of files within a user-specified download directory.
*   **Potential for Malicious Use:** An attacker could potentially craft a malicious `data:` URI to trick users into unintentionally deleting their files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious `data:` URI:**  An attacker could embed a malicious `data:` URI on a website or in an email, and convince the user to save it.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to initiate the save process (by clicking a save button/link and canceling the download) for the exploit to occur.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to deliver malicious content:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious `data:` URI to the user (e.g. via a website or email).
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to save the file and then cancel the download.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The bug was initially discovered in Firefox 0.10 but also affected earlier versions, including Firefox 0.8 and 0.9.
*   Mozilla builds (e.g., 1.7 and 1.8) were not affected.
*   The issue was addressed by a patch that added checks to avoid deleting the directory when a file operation failed. This also addressed a related issue (bug 262478), by changing a `Remove(true)` to a `Remove(false)` in `downloads.js`, preventing recursive deletion.
*   The bug was considered security-sensitive due to the potential for data loss.
*   The fix involved ensuring the file was not recursively deleted, and also adding a default filename when one is not specified (named "unnamed" initially and later addressed in a related bug 262949).
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed after a fix was deployed in Firefox 0.10.1.
