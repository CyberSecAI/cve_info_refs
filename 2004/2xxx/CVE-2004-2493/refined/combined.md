Update: June 27, 2005

HS04-007;
Vulnerabilities in Cross-site Scripting and Directory Traversal of Groupmax World Wide Web
and Groupmax World Wide Web Desktop

Solution for Groupmax World Wide Web and Groupmax
World Wide Web Desktop

Vulnerabilities in cross-site scripting and directory traversal were found in
Groupmax World Wide Web and Groupmax World Wide Web Desktop (Gmax
WWW).

[Influence]

Cross-site scripting

When you log in GmaxWWW and enter HTML tags in the QUERY area of
the GmaxWWW URL, cross-site scripting occurs, and if you click a URL
that contains script, session hijacking may occur.

Directory traversal

When you log in GmaxWWW and specify any directory name or file name
in the template name area of the GmaxWWW URL, directory traversal
occurs, and any HTML file on the Web server can be retrieved; however,
the conditions below must be met to retrieve files on the Web server, so the
risk of attackers retrieving files is reduced.

You must have already logged in GmaxWWW

- This vulnerability cannot be exploited before logging in
GmaxWWW (from the Log in dialog box, etc.)

The file extension is "html"

- This vulnerability allows retrieval of files with the "html" extension.
Files with the "htm" extension cannot be retrieved.
- For the Windows versions, only the files in the drive on which
GmaxWWW is installed can be retrieved.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
