        "root_cause": "The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation within Groupmax World Wide Web and Groupmax World Wide Web Desktop applications.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
          "Cross-site scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks through HTML tags in the QUERY area of a URL. This allows execution of arbitrary scripts.",
          "Directory traversal: The application allows directory traversal by specifying directory or file names in the template name area of a URL. This can lead to unauthorized access to HTML files on the webserver."
        ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking via XSS, and unauthorized access to HTML files on the webserver via directory traversal.  The directory traversal is limited to html files and the specific drive where the application is installed on windows.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "XSS: Sending a crafted URL with malicious HTML in the query string to a user.",
          "Directory traversal: Crafting a URL with directory traversal sequences in the template name."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to craft and deliver malicious URLs to victims. For directory traversal, the attacker needs to be authenticated to the application."
