- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow occurs due to an unchecked `strcat()` operation when constructing an absolute path for a file. The vulnerability arises from the concatenation of a predefined directory path with a filename provided as a parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unchecked buffer overflow vulnerability in the WTHoster and WebDriver modules of the WildTangent Web Driver. Specifically, the use of `strcat()` without bounds checking when concatenating directory paths and filenames.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The buffer overflow can be exploited to achieve arbitrary remote code execution on the target system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered through any method that takes a filename as a parameter within the WildTangent WebDriver. This suggests that a specially crafted filename, when processed, causes a buffer overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted filename as a parameter to the vulnerable WildTangent WebDriver. This could involve exploiting a web application, or another attack vector, that uses the WebDriver to display media content.
