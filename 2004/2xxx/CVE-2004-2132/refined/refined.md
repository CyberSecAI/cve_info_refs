Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2004-2132

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the PJ CGI Neo review (NeoBoard review) script where it improperly handles user-supplied input, specifically the 'p' parameter, allowing path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The script fails to sanitize or validate the 'p' parameter, which is intended to specify a file path. Attackers can use "../" sequences to navigate outside the intended directory, allowing them to access sensitive system files.
- **Arbitrary File Retrieval:** Due to the path traversal vulnerability, attackers can retrieve any file on the web server that the web server user has permissions to read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive information, such as configuration files, passwords, or other confidential data stored on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `PJreview_Neo.cgi` script, with a 'p' parameter containing path traversal sequences.
Example: `<http://address/directory/PJreview_Neo.cgi?p=/../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable script.
- **No Authentication Required:**  The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring any prior authentication.
