[Workaround]

1.  Setting in the configuration file

Set "off" for the DEBUG_MODE property of the runtime environment
definition file (WebPGen.cfg), and use the error template.
(To have error processing perform when DEBUG_MODE=on and an error
message is embedded in an HTML document, it is necessary to use an error
template.)

 DEBUG_MODE=off

2.  Required modifications of the error template

The error template must be changed so that another message about an error
message including file information may be displayed.
To prevent the script embedded in the error message from being executed,
the escape process must be performed in a string of the error message.

<Example>

The following is an example of changing the error template.

File information must be removed out of the message when the
template file fails to open (error code : 1040).
The display of "failure of opening of the template file (c:¥xxx
¥yyy.pgt)" must be changed to "failure of opening of the template
file."

When displaying the error message ($ERROR_MESSAGE variable),
escape processing must be performed using the ESCAPE extension
tag in a variable.

<html>
<body>
<hr>
Template used when an error occurs
<hr>
<br>
ERROR_CODE = $ERROR_CODE<br>
<!@IF CND = ($ERROR_CODE == 1040)>
     failure of opening of the template file<br>
<!@ELSE>
     ERROR_MESSAGE <##ESCAPE($ERROR_MESSAGE) ><br>
<!/IF>
</body>
</html>

For details about the error messages that output file information, see the
error message tables in the appendix of the Web Page Generator Enterprise
User's Guide.
