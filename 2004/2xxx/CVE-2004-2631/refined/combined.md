## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

## PMASA-2004-1

**Announcement-ID:** PMASA-2004-1

**Date:** 2004-06-29

### Summary

When faking table with specific name, an attacker can make phpMyAdmin
to execute arbitrary php code and add custom server configuration.

### Description

phpMyAdmin used eval function to fill some values and one parameter
used there was table name. When specifying specially formatted table
name, this could lead to eval attacker code. However this requires also
a modified MySQL server, that will return these table names, as normally
MySQL doesn't allow it. With conjunction to not checking input variables,
attacker can make phpMyAdmin use patched MySQL server he wants.

### Severity

Default configuration is not affected by this issue, it can happen only
when $$cfg['LeftFrameLight'] is FALSE. When this condition is met,
attacker can execute arbitrary php code which is shipped by his patched
MySQL version. If php is running in safe mode or there is firewall not
allowing outgoing connections to outside machines, this issue can not
cause any harm. As this can cause serious problems, we consider this
issue as critical.

### Affected Versions

All releases starting with 2.5.1 up to and including 2.5.7.

### Unaffected Versions

All releases older than 2.5.1.
CVS HEAD has been fixed.
The upcoming 2.5.7-pl1 release.

### Solution

If you are vulnerable to this issue, we recommend to enable light left
frame mode, which disables eval code. We strongly advise everyone to
upgrade to CVS HEAD or to the next version of phpMyAdmin, which is to be
released soon.

      Bugs: #67409
        ID: 200410-14

Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been found in the MIME-based transformation system
of phpMyAdmin, which may allow remote execution of arbitrary commands
if PHP's "safe mode" is disabled.

Background
==========

phpMyAdmin is a popular web-based MySQL administration tool written in
PHP. It allows users to browse and administer a MySQL database from a
web-browser. Transformations are a phpMyAdmin feature allowing plug-ins
to rewrite the contents of any column seen in phpMyAdmin's Browsing
mode, including using insertion of PHP or JavaScript code.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/phpmyadmin     < 2.6.0_p2                      >= 2.6.0_p2

Description
===========

A defect was found in phpMyAdmin's MIME-based transformation system,
when used with "external" transformations.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
commands on the server with the rights of the HTTP server user.

Workaround
==========

Enabling PHP safe mode ("safe_mode = On" in php.ini) may serve as a
temporary workaround.

Resolution
==========

All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.6.0_p2"
    # emerge ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.6.0_p2"

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# phpMyAdmin: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200407-22**

Multiple vulnerabilities in phpMyAdmin may allow a remote attacker with a
valid user account to alter configuration variables and execute arbitrary
PHP code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/phpmyadmin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.5.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5.7\_p1** |

### Background

phpMyAdmin is a popular, web-based MySQL administration tool written in
PHP. It allows users to administer a MySQL database from a web-browser.

### Description

Two serious vulnerabilities exist in phpMyAdmin. The first allows any
user to alter the server configuration variables (including host, name,
and password) by appending new settings to the array variables that
hold the configuration in a GET statement. The second allows users to
include arbitrary PHP code to be executed within an eval() statement in
table name configuration settings. This second vulnerability is only
exploitable if $cfg['LeftFrameLight'] is set to FALSE.

### Impact

Authenticated users can alter configuration variables for their running
copy of phpMyAdmin. The impact of this should be minimal. However, the
second vulnerability would allow an authenticated user to execute
arbitrary PHP code with the permissions of the webserver, potentially
allowing a serious Denial of Service or further remote compromise.

### Workaround

The second, more serious vulnerability is only exploitable if
$cfg['LeftFrameLight'] is set to FALSE. In the default Gentoo
installation, this is set to TRUE. There is no known workaround for the
first.

### Resolution

All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.5.7_p1"
 # emerge ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.5.7_p1"
```
