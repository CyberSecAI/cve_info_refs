Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2004-2776:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The GoScript `go.cgi` script fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the remote host.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker can execute any command on the server with the privileges of the webserver user. This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the `go.cgi` script.
- The attacker can inject commands into the URL, leveraging the un-sanitized input. Examples provided show the use of `|id|` to inject the `id` command. `http://www.server.com/go.cgi?|id|` and `http://www.server.com/go.cgi?artarchive=|id|`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable URL:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `go.cgi` script.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information indicates that GoScript version 2.0 is vulnerable.
- The vulnerability was identified through a Nessus scan as referenced in the Monitorix Github issue.
