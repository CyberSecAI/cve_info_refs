Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in e107 version 0.615 as described in the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** Several vulnerabilities stem from the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in various scripts and features of e107. This allows attackers to inject malicious code.
*   **Direct Script Access:**  Direct access to certain PHP scripts bypasses intended security measures, leading to information disclosure and XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Reliance on `register_globals`:** The use of `register_globals=on` in PHP configuration makes certain vulnerabilities exploitable.
*   **Insecure SQL Queries:** Improperly constructed SQL queries allow for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure (A1):**
    *   **Description:** Direct access to various plugin scripts without proper handling results in PHP error messages that reveal the server's full file path.
    *   **Examples:** Accessing files like `alt_news.php`, `backend_menu.php`, etc. directly.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (B1-B4):**
    *   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected through various input fields, leading to cookie theft and potential account compromise.
    *   **Specific examples:**
        *   `clock_menu.php` (B1): Through direct access of the script and manipulating the `LAN_407` parameter.
        *   "Email article to a friend" feature (B2): Injecting code in the "logged name" field when logged off.
        *   "Submit news" feature (B3): Injecting code in the "logged name" field when logged off.
        *   "User settings" (B4): Injecting code through the `avmsg` POST parameter.
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI) (C1):**
    *   **Description:** The `secure_img_render.php` script includes remote files, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
    *   **Attack vector:**  Manipulating the `p` parameter to include a malicious PHP file from an external attacker-controlled server.
*   **SQL Injection (D1-D3):**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate SQL queries, extracting sensitive data like usernames and password hashes from the database.
    *   **Specific Examples:**
        *   `content.php` (D1, D2): Using `UNION SELECT` to extract user information.
        *   `news.php` (D3): Using `UNION SELECT` to extract user information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Full path disclosure reveals server structure, which assists in further attacks.
*   **Account Compromise:** XSS can lead to cookie theft, potentially granting access to user accounts. SQL injection also leads to potential admin account takeover via extracted credentials.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** RFI allows arbitrary code execution, leading to complete server compromise, gaining shell access and potentially root access.
*  **Data Breach:** SQL injection can expose sensitive data stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL manipulation:** Appending malicious parameters to URLs to trigger vulnerabilities.
*   **Form input injection:** Injecting malicious code in input fields of forms, especially when logged off.
*   **POST requests:** Injecting malicious code through POST parameters.
*   **Remote file inclusion:** Providing attacker controlled remote file URLs

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Web interaction:** Ability to send HTTP requests, including GET and POST.
*   **No authentication:** Some vulnerabilities are accessible without prior login, while some require login.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable software:** Requires an understanding of the e107 CMS and the affected scripts/features.
*   **Network access:** Need to be able to reach the web server.
*   For RFI, the `allow_url_fopen` PHP setting has to be enabled on the server.
*   For SQL Injection, the MySQL server must be at version 4.x or higher with UNION functionality enabled.
*   `register_globals` setting must be set to `on`.
