Root cause of vulnerability:
The EasyWeb FileManager module for PostNuke is vulnerable to directory traversal due to insufficient input validation of the "pathext" and "view" variables.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Directory traversal vulnerability. The module uses user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can retrieve arbitrary files and directories from the server's file system that are readable by the PHP user. This can lead to information disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive data such as configuration files, passwords, or other confidential information.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL that includes directory traversal sequences (e.g., "../") in the "pathext" and "view" variables.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application through HTTP requests and needs to know the location of the module within the application and its parameters to exploit it. No authentication is required.
