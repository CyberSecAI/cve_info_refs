How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Product:              Trend OfficeScan
Product Description:  Trend OfficeScan is a Corporate Antivirus product from
Trend Microsystems
Vendor URL:           <http://www.antivirus.com>
Versions affected:    3.0 - 6.0 (5.58 is latest version, not fixed until
version 6.5)
Vendor notified:      12th October 2003
Vendor response:      Patch supplied - see details

Details:

The default installation of Trend OfficeScan allows a non admin user to
disable the service, stopping the Antivirus software from working due to
weak permissions. The default permissions on a Trend OfficeScan installation
are:

OfficeScan installation directory (c:\officescan client): "Everyone:Full
Control"
OfficeScan registry data
(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\TrendMicro\PC-cillinNTCorp) "Everyone:Full
Control".

A user (or virus) simply needs to remove files or modify registry keys in
the locations above to cause the antivirus software to stop working.
Additionally, all OfficeScan options are configurable via the registry, e.g.
scan exclusion directories and file extensions to scan (or not scan) can be
configured. It is ironic that a product designed to increase the security of
corporate desktop computers has such weak security itself.

A patch has been developed which tightens security on the registry keys,
however stops certain client functions working (e.g. removes the ability for
the user to see which pattern file is installed, removes the ability to run
a manual scan on the PC). No patch has been supplied to tighten security on
the Trend installation directory. The registry patch is called
"OSCE_Hotfix_RegistryTool.zip" and is available by contacting your Trend
reseller.

Beinning with Trend OfficeScan 6.5 there will be an option to tighten
security, however the default configuration will be to give Everyone:Full
Control on file system and registry keys.
