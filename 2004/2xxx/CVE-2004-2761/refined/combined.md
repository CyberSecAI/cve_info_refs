## Creating a rogue CA certificate

We have identified a vulnerability in the Internet Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) used to issue digital certificates for secure websites. As
a proof of concept we executed a practical attack scenario and successfully
created a rogue Certification Authority (CA) certificate trusted by all common
web browsers. This certificate allows us to impersonate any website on the
Internet, including banking and e-commerce sites secured using the HTTPS
protocol.

Our attack takes advantage of a weakness in the MD5 cryptographic hash
function that allows the construction of different messages with the same MD5
hash. This is known as an MD5 "collision". Previous work on MD5 collisions
between 2004 and 2007 showed that the use of this hash function in digital
signatures can lead to theoretical attack scenarios. Our current work proves
that at least one attack scenario can be exploited in practice, thus exposing
the security infrastructure of the web to realistic threats.

This successful proof of concept shows that the certificate validation
performed by browsers can be subverted and malicious attackers might be able to
monitor or tamper with data sent to secure websites. Banking and e-commerce
sites are particularly at risk because of the high value of the information
secured with HTTPS on those sites. With a rogue CA certificate, attackers would
be able to execute practically undetectable phishing attacks against such
sites.

The infrastructure of Certification Authorities is meant to prevent exactly
this type of attack. Our work shows that known weaknesses in the MD5 hash
function can be exploited in realistic attack, due to the fact that even after
years of warnings about the lack of security of MD5, some root CAs are still
using this broken hash function.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-02 12:52:15 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2004-2761](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-2761) to the following vulnerability:  The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm is not collision resistant, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to conduct spoofing attacks, as demonstrated by attacks on the use of MD5 in the signature algorithm of an X.509 certificate.  References: <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/836068> <http://eprint.iacr.org/2004/199> <http://eprint.iacr.org/2005/067> <http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/> <http://www.phreedom.org/research/rogue-ca/> <http://blog.mozilla.com/security/2008/12/30/md5-weaknesses-could-lead-to-certificate-forgery/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-02 13:30:44 UTC  ``` As noted in the Knowledgebase article, Red Hat Certificate System is configured to use SHA-1 hash algorithm by default:  <https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-15379>  It was discovered, however, that Red Hat / Dogtag Certificate System used MD5 algorithm for SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol) protocol communication and provided no way to disable the use of MD5.  There are additional implementation properties that make an MD5 chosen-prefix collision attack more feasible against Certificate System's SCEP component:  - Main Certificate Authority's key pair used to issue certificates is used to secure SCEP communication too (to decrypt requests and sign responses).  - All SCEP responses are signed by CA, including negative / failure responses.  An attacker does not need to have a valid enrollment one-time PIN to get signed reply from the Certificate System.  - Certificate System does not limit the size of the the senderNonce provided in the SCEP request and which is echoed back in the SCEP reply.  It also did not provide its own senderNonce in SCEP reply packets.  Colliding prefix can be used as part of the sender nonce that is echoed back by the CA unchanged.  This may allow attacker to create certificate or CRL signed using CA's key and using MD5 has algorithms.  Following changes were done in the Certificate System to address this problem:  - Support for SHA hash function family (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512) was added to Red Hat Certificate System 7.3.  These hash functions were previously supported in version 8.  SHA-1 hash function is now used by default.  - CS.cfg configuration file can now specify default and allowed algorithms to be used by the SCEP component, e.g.:     ca.scep.hashAlgorithm=SHA1     ca.scep.allowedHashAlgorithms=SHA1,SHA256,SHA512 Similar options - ca.scep.encryptionAlgorithm and ca.scep.allowedEncryptionAlgorithms - can be used to configure encryption algorithm preferences.  Allowed algorithms list can be used to avoid downgrade to the use of weaker algorithms in cases where network devices tries to use DES/MD5 first for compatibility with older SCEP specifications.  The use of SHA hash algorithm avoids the MD5 collision problem.  Following additional changes aim to make the attack less feasible in configuration where the use of MD5 can not be disabled.  - It is possible to limit the size of the nonce copied from SCEP requests to SCEP responses using ca.scep.nonceSizeLimit option.  Default CS.cfg file sets the limit to 16 bytes.  - SCEP replies now include server-generated nonce.  - Separate key pair can be used for SCEP communication.  It can be specified in the CS.cfg configuration using ca.scep.nickname option.  - SCEP component is disabled by default.  It can be enabled by adding ca.scep.enable=true to the CS.cfg configuration file.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2010-11-02 23:14:51 UTC  ``` Is the intent of this bug to phase out MD5 usage in programs (i.e. replacing it with SHA256?) in Red Hat products?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-03 10:07:56 UTC  ``` Not a phase out all MD5, but phase out where needed.  Results of the efforts that were done in Fedora to add support for stronger hashes are to be seen in future Red Hat products too, of course.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-08 20:07:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Certificate System 7.3  Via RHSA-2010:0837 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0837.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-08 20:12:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Certificate System 8  Via RHSA-2010:0838 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0838.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-09 13:58:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c1))  > Following changes were done in the Certificate System to address this > problem: >  > - Support for SHA hash function family (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512) was added > to Red Hat Certificate System 7.3.

| **Summary** |  | We have identified a vulnerability in the Internet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) used to issue digital certificates for secure websites. As a proof of concept we executed a practical attack scenario and successfully created a rogue Certification Authority (CA) certificate trusted by all common web browsers. This certificate allows us to impersonate any website on the Internet, including banking and e-commerce sites secured using the HTTPS protocol.  Our attack takes advantage of a weakness in the MD5 cryptographic hash function that allows the construction of different messages with the same MD5 hash. This is known as an MD5 "collision". Previous work on MD5 collisions between 2004 and 2007 showed that the use of this hash function in digital signatures can lead to theoretical attack scenarios. Our current work proves that at least one attack scenario can be exploited in practice, thus exposing the security infrastructure of the web to realistic threats.  As a result of this successfull attack, we are currently in possession of a rogue Certification Authority certificate. This certificate will be accepted as valid and trusted by all common browsers, because it appears to be signed by one of the root CAs that browsers trust by default. In turn, any website certificate signed by our rogue CA will be trusted as well. If an unsuspecting user is a victim of a man-in-the-middle attack using such a certificate,  they will be assured that the connection is secure through all common security indicators:  a "https://" url in the address bar, a closed padlock and messages such as "This certificate is OK" if they chose to inspect the certificate.  This successful proof of concept shows that the certificate validation performed by browsers can be subverted and malicious attackers might be able to monitor or tamper with data sent to secure websites. Banking and e-commerce sites are particularly at risk because of the high value of the information secured with HTTPS on those sites. With a rogue CA certificate, attackers would be able to execute practically undetectable phishing attacks against such sites.  The infrastructure of Certification Authorities is meant to prevent exactly this type of attack. Our work shows that known weaknesses in the MD5 hash function can be exploited in realistic attack, due to the fact that even after years of warnings about the lack of security of MD5, some root CAs are still using this broken hash function.  The vulnerability we expose is not in the SSL protocol or the web servers and browsers that implement it, but in the Public Key Infrastructure. This infrastructure has applications in other areas than the web, but we have not investigated all other possible attack scenarios. So other attack scenarios beyond the web are conceivable, such as in the areas of code signing, e-mail security, and in other areas that use certificates for enabling digital signatures or public key encryption.  The rest of this document will explain our work and its implications in a fair amount of detail. In the interest of protecting the Internet against malicious attacks using our technique, we have omitted the critical details of our sophisticated and highly optimized method for computing MD5 collisions. A scientific paper [[SSALMOW]](index.html#Ref) about our method is available as of March 11, 2009, so that the affected Certification Authorities have had some time to remedy this vulnerability. |

| Presentation |  | This work was presented on December 30, 2008 at the [25th Annual Chaos Communication Congress](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/) in Berlin.    The presentation was originally announced as "Making the theoretical possible. Attacking a critical piece of Internet infrastructure", but finally was entitled ["MD5 considered harmful today: creating a rogue CA certificate"](downloads/md5-collisions-1.0.pdf).  [added Jan. 8, 2009] [Video and audio files of the 25C3 presentation](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/wiki/Conference_Recordings) in different formats are available from CCC. Look for files with names like "25c3-3023-en-making\_the\_theoretical\_possible.xyz".  Our demo at the 25c3 was based on ["sslsniff"](http://thoughtcrime.org/software/sslsniff/index.html) by Moxie Marlinspike. We modified it ever so slightly to be more verbose (and hopefully more visual as a demo), to randomize serial numbers (to fix an issue with Firefox) and to sign with a user selected hash function (this allowed for SHA-1 signatures in the leaf certificate). Jacob Appelbaum misspoke when he said that he had written this tool at the start; he correctly explained the tool's origin at the end of the video. |
| --- |  | --- |
| **1. Outline of the attack** |  | Our attack scenario basically is as follows. We request a legitimate website certificate from a commercial Certification Authority trusted by all common browsers. Since the request is legitimate, the CA signs our certificate and returns it to us. We have picked a CA that uses the MD5 hash function to generate the signature of the certificate, which is important because our certificate request has been crafted to result in an MD5 collision with a second certificate. This second certificate is not a website certificate, but an intermediary CA certificate that can be used to sign arbitrary other website certificates we want to issue. Since the MD5 hashes of both the legitimate and the rogue certificates are the same, the digital signature obtained from the commercial CA can simply be copied into our rogue CA certificate and it will remain valid.  | Here is a schematic diagram and a description of how website certificates are meant to operate.  | 1 | A Certification Authority distributes its CA root certificate (the white one in the diagram) via browser vendors to browsers. These root certificates reside in a "trust list" on the user's PC. This means that all certificates issued by this CA will be trusted by default by the users. | | --- | --- | | 2 | A company that wants its website to be secured, purchases a website certificate at the CA (the green one in the diagram). This certificate is signed by the CA and guarantees the identity of the website to the users. | | 3 | When a user wants to visit the secure website, the web browser will first ask the web server for the certificate. If its signature can be verified with the certificate of a CA in the trust list, the website certificate will be accepted. Then the website will be loaded into the browser, and all traffic between the browser and the website will be secured by using encryption. | |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  And here is a similar diagram and description of how our attack scenario may be used to impersonate an existing website.    | 1a | A legitimate website certificate is obtained from a commercial CA (the blue one in the diagram). | | --- | --- | | 1b | A rogue CA certificate is constructed (the black one in the diagram). It bears exactly the same signature as the website certificate. Thus it appears as being issued by the CA, whereas in fact the CA has never even seen it. | | 2 | Then a website certificate (the red one in the diagram) bearing the genuine website's identity but another public key is created and signed by the rogue CA. A copy of the genuine website is built, put on another web server, and equipped with the rogue website certificate. | | 3 | When a user wants to visit the secure website, the web browser will look on the Internet for the genuine web server. There exist "redirection attacks", by which the communication from the browser can be redirected to the rogue website. This rogue website presents its certificate to the user, together with the rogue CA certificate. The signature in the rogue website certificate can be verified with the rogue CA certificate, and this rogue CA certificate in turn will be accepted by the browser, as its signature can be verified with the CA root certificate in the trust list. The user will not notice anything. |  An effective and efficient countermeasure to remediate this vulnerability is to stop using MD5 for digital signatures. Acceptable alternatives to replace MD5, such as SHA-1, are widespread or, like SHA-2, at least becoming rapidly available. Fortunately most CAs have already taken such steps. It would be best to stop using MD5 for the creation of certificates altogether, as its continued use may lead to severe security problems. As a last resort, in the case that MD5 cannot be discontinued immediately, a CA can take simple alternative countermeasures such as randomizing the serial numbers of all newly issued certificates. We stress that such countermeasures are mere band-aids rather than fundamental solutions.  We also recommend to be similarly careful when using SHA-1 and to avoid its adoption in new products, as theoretically it has been shown that it suffers from similar problems as MD5. While the weaknesses in SHA-1 known so far do at this moment not allow the same type of attack scenarios we have shown to be possible for MD5, experts in the area believe that it is sufficiently likely that before long SHA-1 suffers the same fate as MD5. |

| **2. Certificate background** |  |  |
|  |  | --- |
| 2.1. The need for certificates |  | More and more the web is used for exchanging sensitive information. Think of internet banking websites, websites that require a login password, websites on which transactions with financial value can be performed, etc. Often the sensitivity of the information implies that it should not be exposed to unauthorized persons. The exchange of sensitive information requires that the user of a website wants assurance that the website he or she is visiting is not a rogue web site, but is the genuine website of the organisation he or she has to do business with. This is what certificates provide.  A certificate is a document that contains both an identity and a public key, binding them together by a digital signature. This digital signature is created by an organisation called a Certification Authority (CA). This organisation guarantees that upon creating the digital signature it has checked the identity of the public key owner (e.g. by verifying a passport) and that is has checked that this public key owner is in possession of the corresponding private key. Anybody in possession of the CA's public key can verify the CA's signature on the certificate. In this way the CA guarantees that the public key in the certificate belongs to the individual whose identity is in the same certificate. |
|  |  | --- |
| 2.2. X.509 certificates |  | The worldwide accepted standard for digital certificates is called X.509. An X.509 certificate contains the following parts  * the "to-be-signed" part, consisting of:   + serial number+ validity period+ issuer name - this is the identity of the issuing CA+ subject name - this is the identity of the party being certified; this can           be a user (person, organisation, website), another CA, or even the issuing CA itself+ subject public key - the public key of the party being certified+ "basic constraints" field, containing               - a bit indicating whether this is a CA certificate or a user certificate                 (we will denote this by "CA = TRUE" resp. "CA = FALSE")- a path length field, indicating the maximum number of intermediate CAs                   that are allowed between the "root CA" and the end user* the "signature" part, containing a digital signature over the "to-be-signed"     part; this digital signature is produced using the issuing CA's private key.  By the digital signature in a certificate, the CA guarantees that it has checked (according to its policies) that the subject identity mentioned inside the certificate is indeed the owner of the public key that is inside the same certificate, and that this public key owner also is in possession of the corresponding private key. The signature in the certificate can be verified by anybody, by using the issuing CA's public key. |
|  |  | --- |
| 2.3. Certificate hierarchy |  | X.509 certificates fit into a hierarchy of CA and end user certificates. A signature on data can be verified by the signer's public key. This public key is linked to the owner's identity by a certificate. This link can be verified by verifying the certificate's signature, using the public key of the issuing CA. This CA public key can be found inside the CA certificate, one layer upwards in the hierarchy. This CA certificate will itself be signed by a CA another layer up. At the top of the hierarchy there is the "root certificate", that is "self signed", and that has to be trusted for its own sake.  Many of these self signed root certificates are installed in browsers or operating systems. Applications using them, such as web browsers, will trust them automatically, i.e. the applications will accept the certificates as authenticated and genuine without explicitly asking the user if it should do so. The user may be notified by small security signs such as a closed padlock symbol in the browser's frame. Every certificate that is in a hierarchy of which the root certificate is trusted, is also automatically trusted. |

| **3. Hash function background** |
|  |  | --- |
| 3.1. Hash functions |  | The cryptographic operation that uses a private key to sign data does not deal directly with the data itself, but with a purportedly unique representation of this data, that has a predetermined fixed length, is short and therefore convenient to work with. This can be compared to a fingerprint as a purportedly unique, short and convenient representation of a human being. The process of creating such short representations of data is called "hashing". Unfortunately, because of the fixed length of the hash, there must exist pairs of different inputs that yield the same hash value. Good hash functions, however, have the property that finding such pairs is extremely difficult, even though they are guaranteed to exist. This is precisely where MD5 has a crucial weakness.  A "hash function" is a cryptographic function that takes as its input a bit string of any length, performs a deterministic algorithm with this input, and produces as output a bit string of fixed length. This output is called the "hash value" or the "hash" of the input. Other terms that can be found for "hash value" are "fingerprint" or "message digest"  If `H` is a hash function, `m` is an input bit string, and `h` is the output of `H` applied to the input `m`, then we write `h = H(m)`. Some common and useful terminology:  * if `h = H(m)` then   + `h` is called the "hash" of `m`,+ `m` is called a "preimage" of `h`,* for a given input `m`, a "second preimage" of `m` is a different input `m'` such that     `H(m) = H(m')`,* if `m` and `m'` are different inputs such that `H(m) = H(m')` then the pair `{m,m'}`       is called a "collision" for `H`.  The difference between the concepts of second preimage and collision is subtle, but crucial. |
|  |  | --- |
| 3.2. Hash function requirements |  | A hash function should satisfy the following requirements:  * (**practicality**) computing the hash `h(m)` of any input `m` can be done efficiently,* (**preimage resistance**) given `h`, it is hard to compute a preimage of `h`, i.e. it     is hard to compute an `m` such that `h = H(m)`,* (**second preimage resistance**) given `m`, it is hard to compute a second preimage       of `m`, i.e. it is hard to compute an `m'` such that `m ≠ m'` and yet `H(m) = H(m')`,* (**collision resistance**) it is hard to compute a collision for `H`, i.e. it is         hard to compute `m` and `m'` such that `m ≠ m'` and yet `H(m) = H(m')`.  Let us assume that we have a hash function which produces hashes with a length of `k` bits. Brute force methods simply try all possible inputs in a certain range, or try a large number of random inputs, until a (second) preimage or a collision are found. For (second) preimage resistance this requires an expected number of hash computations equal to `2k`. For collision resistance the situation is different, due to the "birthday paradox", reducing the number of hash computations to approximately `2k/2`. Cryptographers say that a hash function with hash length `k` provides only `k/2` bits security.  A cryptographic hash function is said to be "cryptographically strong" if no better methods are known than the above mentioned brute force type methods with the mentioned complexities. |
|  |  | --- |
| 3.3. Hash function history |  | In 1990 Rivest designed MD4, a hash function with hash length 128 bits. Collisions for MD4 were found in 1995. In 2005 a method for finding preimages was published.  In 1991 Rivest announced MD4's successor, MD5, an improved design, also with hash length 128. In 1993 some weaknesses in its design were pointed out, but it took until 2004 before collisions were found. Producing collisions is nowadays a matter of seconds on a PC. The more advanced type of collisions used in our method can be produced in a matter of hours on special but commodity hardware.  In 1995 NIST proposed SHA-1, a hash function with hash length 160 bits. In 2005 weaknesses in its design were found, showing that finding collisions takes essentially fewer computations than the brute force method of complexity 280, but so far collisions have not been published. NIST advises to replace SHA-1 by 2010.  From their introduction until the present day, the hash functions MD5 and SHA-1 have been the work horses of many cryptographic systems. The replacement of MD5 in common applications is far from completed. The replacement of SHA-1 has not really taken off yet.  Even if SHA-1 would have lived up to its design objectives, its output length of 160 is too small to justify its prolonged use for more than the short term. NIST recognized this at an early stage, and came in 2001 with the new SHA-2 family of hash functions. So far these have withstood all cryptanalysis. Nevertheless NIST saw the need for mobilizing the cryptographic community to get a deeper understanding of hash function design and to come up with better hash functions for the next 10 years. Therefore it has started an open competition for selecting the successor of SHA-2, dubbed for the moment SHA-3. The winner of this competition is expected to be selected by 2012, and will most probably become the de facto hashing standard for the next decade. |
|  |  | --- |
| 3.4. The Design of MD5 |  | MD5 uses the Merkle-Damgård iterative construction. The input bit string is padded to a multiple of 512 bits. The length of the unpadded bit string is incorporated in this padding. Then the padded input bit string is divided into blocks of 512 bits each, hereafter called "input blocks".  The core of MD5 is a compression function. The input blocks are fed to MD5 in successive calls to the compression function, that uses each input block in updating a state of 128 bits. This state is called `IHV`, which stands for "Intermediate Hash Value". Thus the compression function accepts as input a 128 bit state `IHV` and a 512 bit data block, and produces as output an updated state `IHV`. The initial state is a fixed value, and the final state is the hash value.  So if we denote the input blocks by `M1, M2, ..., Mn` (512 bits each), the initial `IHV` by `IHV0` (128 bits), and the compression function by `CF`, then the sequence of computations is  `IHV0 = fixed value IHV1 = CF(IHV0, M1) IHV2 = CF(IHV1, M2) IHV3 = CF(IHV2, M3)      :      :      : IHVn-1 = CF(IHVn-2, Mn-1) IHVn = CF(IHVn-1, Mn) MD5 hash = IHVn` |
|  |  | --- |
| 3.5. Collisions for MD5 |  | In 2004 Xiaoyun Wang and Hongbo Yu presented a collision for MD5 consisting of 2 input blocks, neglecting padding. Details of the collision construction method were published at EuroCrypt 2005 in [[WY]](index.html#Ref). Their method works for any value of the initial `IHV0`.  In other words, their method produces on input of any 128 bit `IHV0` a pair `{{M1,M2}, {M1',M2'}}`, each consisting of two 512 bit input blocks, such that `{M1,M2} ≠ {M1',M2'}`, and  `IHV0 = IHV0'  IHV1 = CF(IHV0,M1) ≠ IHV1' = CF(IHV0',M1')  IHV2 = CF(IHV1,M2) = IHV2' = CF(IHV1',M2')`  Due to the iterative structure of MD5 and to the fact that `IHV0` can have any 128 bit value, such collisions can be combined into larger inputs. Namely, for any given prefix `P` and any given suffix `S` a pair of "collision blocks" `{C,C'}` can be computed such that `MD5(P||C||S) = MD5(P||C'||S)`. We use the term "collision block" for a specially crafted bit string that is inserted into another bit string to achieve a collision. One collision block may consist of several input blocks, even including partial input blocks. The collision blocks of [[WY]](index.html#Ref) consist of precisely two consecutive input blocks. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | In his 2007 MSc thesis [[S]](index.html#Ref) (see also [[SLW]](index.html#Ref)), Marc Stevens extended this collision construction method to so called "chosen-prefix collisions". This means that collisions can be found between different arbitrary initial `IHV`s. His method may require more than two input blocks.  Thus, due to the iterative structure of MD5, the chosen-prefix collision construction method is able to produce on input of any pair of chosen prefixes `{P,P'}` and any suffix `S`, a pair of collision blocks `{C,C'}`, such that `MD5(P||C||S) = MD5(P'||C'||S)`.  To be more precise, for given `{P,P'}` the collision blocks are constructed as follows. First `P, P'` are padded with bit strings `A, A'` of any useful size and contents to achieve equal lengths of `P||A` and `P'||A'`. Then, using a "birthdaying" step, bit strings `B, B'` are produced such that the resulting `P||A||B` and `P'||A'||B'` have equal length, being a multiple of 512, and such that the resulting `IHV`s at this point have a prespecified structure. This enables the construction of a pair of "near collision blocks" `{NC,NC'}` that gives rise to a collision. Each near collision block will consist of a number of 512 bit input blocks. Thus, with `C = A||B||NC` and `C' = A'||B'||NC'`, the resulting `IHV`s are identical. Consequently, `MD5(P||C) = MD5(P'||C')`, and thus also for any suffix `S` it is the case that `MD5(P||C||S) = MD5(P'||C'||S)`.  The chosen-prefix collision construction method is feasible in practice, but of essentially higher complexity than the method using identical arbitrary initial `IHV`s. However, in return one gets complete freedom in the choice of both prefixes `P` and `P'`. |

| **4. Colliding certificates history** |  |  |
|  |  | --- |
| 4.1. Meaningfulness |  | The main problem in trying to abuse the type of collisions for MD5 that can be produced with the available methods is that one does not have sufficient control over the input blocks that are calculated to let the `IHV`s collide. This means that no methods are known to obtain collision blocks with a prescribed formatting, which would be needed to make the collision blocks fit into a meaningful file.  For a number of different file types, applications of collisions and chosen-prefix collisions have been described in the literature solving the problem of meaningfulness in various ways, see e.g. ["The story of Alice and her Boss"](http://th.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/People/lucks/HashCollisions/). We now concentrate on the applications to certificates. |
|  |  | --- |
| 4.2. Different public keys |  | In 2005 Arjen Lenstra, Benne de Weger and Xiaoyun Wang [[LW]](index.html#Ref) showed how collisions of the identical initial `IHV` type could be built into a pair of X.509 certificates. For an example, see ["Colliding X.509 Certificates based on MD5-collisions"](https://www.win.tue.nl/~bdeweger/CollidingCertificates/). The main idea was to hide the random-looking (but carefully engineered) collision blocks in the public key. This will not raise any suspicion, not even to a careful observer who scrutinizes all bits of a certificate looking for signs of fraud, as public keys usually look perfectly like random data anyway. It turned out to be possible to hide collision blocks inside RSA moduli while even assuring the security of the pairs of moduli as being both products of sufficiently large primes. Thus it was shown how to produce a pair of different X.509 certificates with identical MD5 hash values of the "to-be-signed" parts, and therefore with identical CA signatures. This is a violation of fundamental principles of the certificate infrastructure. However, as the prefixes of the colliding inputs had to be equal, the certificates were showing identical identities, severely limiting the practical abuse potential. |
|  |  | --- |
| 4.3. Different identities |  | In 2007, due to the work of Marc Stevens [[S]](index.html#Ref), chosen-prefix collisions for MD5 had become available. This meant that it had become possible to choose any pair of prefixes in the certificates before the RSA moduli, and get certificates with different chosen identities and different public keys (hiding the collision blocks), and with identical MD5 hash values of the "to-be-signed" parts, thus with identical CA signatures. For an example, see ["Colliding X.509 Certificates for Different Identities"](../TargetCollidingCertificates/index.html). This is already a much more interesting application. However, a number of limitations complicate this attack when applied to real Certification Authorities.  The attacker has to choose the entire prefix before the collision generation process can begin. This includes fields that the attacker does not directly control, such as the validity period and serial number of the signed certificate. Succesfully predicting those fields requires significant control over the CA's operational procedures, which was thought to be hard to achieve. In addition, the colliding certificates in ["Colliding X.509 Certificates for Different Identities"](../TargetCollidingCertificates/index.html) used 8192 bit RSA keys, which are not accepted by all Certification Authorities.  Nevertheless, both the collision construction method of 2005 and the much better chosen-prefix collision construction method of 2007 on certificates based on MD5 were a firm warning to the security community that MD5 should no longer be used for digital signatures in certificates. As attacks only get better with time, it should not come as a surprise that in 2008 we were able to improve upon the previous work on colliding certificates and obtain a rogue CA certificate signed by a commercial Certification Authority. |

| **5. Attack details** |  |  |
|  |  | --- |
| 5.1. Introduction |  | In July 2008 we set out to investigate if the colliding certificates attack could be applied to a real Certification Authority. The first step was to identify the CAs that still used MD5. Unfortunately it is not possible to determine the hash function a CA uses from the CA certificate. We had to look at (website) certificates issued by the CAs instead. Over the course of a week we spidered the web and collected more than 100,000 SSL certificates, of which about 30,000 were signed by CAs trusted by Firefox. There were six CAs that had issued certificates signed with MD5 in 2008:  * [RapidSSL](http://www.rapidssl.com/)   C=US, O=Equifax Secure Inc., CN=Equifax Secure Global eBusiness CA-1 * [FreeSSL](http://www.rapidssl.com/ssl-certificate-products/free-ssl/freessl.htm)   (free trial certificates offered by RapidSSL)   C=US, ST=UT, L=Salt Lake City, O=The USERTRUST Network, OU=http://www.usertrust.com,   CN=UTN-USERFirst-Network Applications * [TC TrustCenter AG](http://www.trustcenter.de/)   C=DE, ST=Hamburg, L=Hamburg, O=TC TrustCenter for Security in Data Networks GmbH,   OU=TC TrustCenter Class 3 CA/emailAddress=certificate@trustcenter.de * [RSA Data Security](https://www.verisign.com/repository/root.html#rsass)   C=US, O=RSA Data Security, Inc., OU=Secure Server Certification Authority * [Thawte](http://www.thawte.com/)   C=ZA, ST=Western Cape, L=Cape Town, O=Thawte Consulting cc, OU=Certification Services   Division, CN=Thawte Premium Server CA/emailAddress=premium-server@thawte.com * [verisign.co.jp](http://www.verisign.co.jp/)   O=VeriSign Trust Network, OU=VeriSign, Inc., OU=VeriSign International Server CA - Class   3, OU=www.verisign.com/CPS Incorp.by Ref. LIABILITY LTD.(c)97 VeriSign  Out of the 30,000 certificates we collected, about 9,000 were signed using MD5, and 97% of those were issued by RapidSSL.  It was quite surprising that so many CAs are still using MD5, considering that MD5 has been known to be insecure since the first collisions were presented in 2004. Since these CAs had ignored all previous warnings by the cryptographic community, we felt that it would be appropriate to attempt a practical attack to demonstrate the risk they present to everybody using a web browser that includes their root CA certificates.  We set out to obtain a legitimate website certificate from this CA for which we would be able to predict the entire contents of the "to-be-signed" part. This certificate would contain a specially crafted collision block in the RSA modulus, which would result in a MD5 collision with a second specially crafted certificate. An ignorant observer, no matter how carefully the certificate is inspected, would most likely fail to notice anything suspicious about it.  Once we have obtained a valid signature from this CA, we would copy it into our second certificate. Since the "to-be-signed" parts of both certificates have the same MD5 hash, the signature would be valid for the second certificate. Thus the real CA, without knowing it, would provide us with a valid signature for a certificate it has never seen, and should never have signed.  The potential of this attack scenario is even greater than just obtaining a rogue certificate for a single secure website. This is because our rogue certificate doesn't have to be a website certificate, but it could be an intermediary CA certificate. Although the certificate originally signed by the real CA has in the "basic constraints" field the flag "CA = FALSE", indicating that this certificate cannot be used to validate other certificates in a certificate chain, our rogue certificate has the same flag set to "CA = TRUE". We are in possession of the private key corresponding to the public key in this rogue CA certificate. As a result we are able to issue any number of certificates to anybody we choose, and they will be recognized as valid certificates by anybody trusting the real CA, which is all Internet users using one of the common web browsers. |

| 5.2. Validity period and serial number prediction |  | The first big challenge was to figure out a way to predict the validity period and serial numbers of the certificates issued by a Certification Authority, since these are the only two fields in the chosen prefix that the attacker does not control directly.  Predicting the validity period of the certificate turned out to be an easy task. The system used by RapidSSL and FreeSSL for issuing certificates is fully automated and each certificate is issued exactly 6 seconds after the user clicks on the final "Ok" button to complete the purchase. Since the timestamps in the certificate validity period field use granularity in seconds, we could easily click this button at an arbitrary time T-6 seconds and get a certificate with a validity from time T to T+(1 year). With full control over the validity period, we move on to solving the serial number prediction problem.  We estimated that it would take us 3 days to generate our pair of colliding certificates, which meant that we needed to predict the serial number of the certificate three days in advance. Most of the certificates in our data set had serial numbers that looked random and thus hard to predict, but we noticed that RapidSSL and FreeSSL were using sequential serial numbers.  One can think of the sequential serial number as a remote counter. Each certificate we purchase from the CA reveals the current value of the counter and increments it by one. During the normal operation of the Certification Authority, the counter is incremented based on the number of the issued certificates. Statistical analysis of the serial numbers from the 9,251 certificates in our RapidSSL data set revealed that on average this number has a pretty low variance. In a three day period from Thursday night to Sunday night, the CA typically issues between 800 and 1000 certificates:    The anomaly with the last data point in the graph above is a result of the 100 certificates we purchased during one particular weekend at the end of September. Without our involvement, the increment during that weekend would have been a little less than 1000.  With this information, we decided on the following plan: On Thursday night, we would purchase a certificate to get the current value of the serial number S. We would predict that on Sunday night (time T) the serial number would be a little less than S+1000. A few hours before time T, we would start purchasing certificates to push up the serial number closer and closer to the target number, finally getting it to S+999 about 30 seconds before time T. If we were lucky and the CA received no other certificate request during those last 30 seconds, we would be able to send a request at time T and get our predicted serial number. |  |  | --- | | 5.3. Constructing colliding certificates |  | In this section a detailed description is given of the contents of the two certificates with identical signatures that we now have. The certificate we obtained from the commercial CA will hereafter be called the "real certificate". Its sibling certificate is our "rogue CA certificate", and it is a sibling in the sense that the "to-be-signed" parts of these certificates were constructed together, to constitute a collision for the MD5 hash function.  The real certificate was requested from the CA by sending it a "Certificate Signing Request" (CSR). The initial engineering task we had to do is to construct the contents of the CSR and the structure and contents of the rogue CA certificate in such a way that the resulting real certificate (constructed by the CA) and the rogue CA certificate (constructed by us) will be perfectly aligned. The second, and much more intricate, engineering task was to predict the contents of various fields in the real certificates, and based on this, construct the contents of various other fields in both certificates, in such a way that we would be able to obtain an MD5 collision.  Complying with the X.509 standard [[HPFS]](index.html#Ref), each of the two certificates consists of:  * a header of 4 bytes,* a so called "to-be-signed" part of 927 bytes,* a so called "signature algorithm" field of 15 bytes,* a "signature" field of 131 bytes.  The picture below shows in great detail the alignment and most of the contents of the two certificates. The colors green, yellow and red respectively indicate the chosen prefixes, the collision blocks and the suffixes. Click on picture to get it in better resolution in pdf format in a new window. | |  |  |  | | 5.3.1. The real certificate and the CSR |  | The structure of the "to-be-signed" part of the real certificate is prescribed by the CA. We have control over contents and length of a few fields only. The structure is as follows:  | byte 0 - 3: | header | | --- | --- | | byte 4 - 8: | version number (3, default value) | | byte 9 - 13: | serial number (643015, set by CA and predicted by us) | | byte 14 - 28: | signature algorithm ("md5withRSAEncryption", set by CA) | | byte 29 - 120: | issuer Distinguished Name (CA default value) | | byte 121 - 152: | validity ("from 3 Nov. 2008 7:52:02 to 4 Nov. 2009 7:52:02", set by CA and predicted by us) | | byte 153 - 440: | subject Distinguished Name (Country = "US", Organisation = "i.broke.the.internet.and.all.i.got.was.this.t-shirt.phreedom.org", Organisational Unit (3 fields set by the CA)  Common Name = "i.broke.the.internet.and.all.i.got.was.this.t-shirt.phreedom.org", Country, Organisation and Common Name set by us in the CSR) | | byte 441 - 734: | subject public key info:  | byte 441 - 444: | header | | --- | --- | | byte 445 - 459: | public key algorithm ("RSAEncryption", set by us in the CSR) | | byte 460 - 468: | headers | | byte 469 - 729: | RSA modulus (2048 bit value, set by us in the CSR) | | byte 730 - 734: | RSA public exponent (65537, set by us in the CSR) | | | byte 735 - 926: | extensions:  | byte 735 - 740: | headers | | --- | --- | | byte 741 - 756: | key usage ("digital signature, nonrepudiation, key encipherment, data encipherment", set by CA) | | byte 757 - 881: | subject key identifier, crl distribution points, authority key identifier (uninteresting fields, set by CA) | | byte 882 - 912: | extended key usage ("server authentication, client authentication", set by CA) | | byte 913 - 926: | basic constraints ("CA = FALSE, Path Length = None", set by CA) | |     To obtain this certificate we constructed a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), according to the required PKCS#10 format. This request contains the following data:  * "to-be-signed" part:   + version number (1)+ subject Country = "US"+ subject Common Name =         "i.broke.the.internet.and.all.i.got.was.this.t-shirt.phreedom.org"         (used by the CA for the fields Organisation and Common Name)+ public key algorithm ("RSAEncryption")+ public key (consisting of the RSA modulus and the RSA exponent)* signature algorithm ("md5withRSAEncryption")* signature (2048 bit value, computed with our private key over the "to-be-signed"       part, this signature can be verified with the public key inside the request,       in this way the CA can be certain that the requestor is in possession of the       corresponding private key)  The requirements for the construction of the key pair for the real certificate were as follows:  * the modulus should be a 2048 bit value,* as public exponent we conveniently chose 65537, as usual,* the corresponding private key is required to be known by us, because with it       the CSR has to be signed,* the collision blocks are hidden in the modulus.  The alignment turned out such that the 256 byte modulus starts at byte 474. This means that we have 38 bytes of the current 512 bit MD5 input block left. The first 26 bytes of those were simply chosen at random. The last 12 bytes of those were used as "birthday bits", see below for further explanation.  Then we had three "near collision blocks" of 512 bits (i.e. 64 bytes) each. The entire "collision block" thus consists of 96 + 3 x 512 = 1632 bits, i.e. 204 bytes.  At the end of the last near collision block the MD5 collision is established. The collision block was computed by the collision finding method described below. That means that we do not have much control over its contents, we simply have to accept the random looking data that comes out of the cluster of game consoles.  Then we have 256 - 26 - 204 = 26 bytes (= 208 bits) left in the modulus. We used them to make sure that the modulus will have the form of a product of two primes, known to us, in such a way that we can also compute the corresponding private exponent. This is done as follows.  We start with a fixed bit string `B` of 1840 bits (230 bytes, namely 38 bytes to reach alignment with MD5 input blocks, plus 3 x 64 bytes for 3 near collision blocks). We now want to append another bit string `S` of 208 bits (26 bytes) such that the resulting 2048 bit `B||S` represents an integer which is a reasonably secure RSA modulus, i.e. a number `n=p×q` with `p,q` prime, that withstands current factoring methods. In order to find such `S`, we pick a random 224 bit integer `q`, and then hope that there is an integer `p` such that `B||S` represents the number `n=p×q`. Then we hope that both `p,q` are prime. If our hopes turn out to be false, we simply try another random value `q`, until we succeed.  This method seems coarse, but we don't know how to do it better, and it works well in practice. The reason is as follows. The value of `n` we are looking for lies in the interval `B×2208≤n<(B+1)×2208`. For a given `q` of `k` bits this means that the interval from `(B/q)×2208` to `((B+1)/q)×2208` should contain an integer `p`, and furthermore that the integers `p,q` both are prime. As the width of this interval is `2208/q`, which is approximately `2208-k`, we have to try approximately `2k-208` times before we find such an integer `p` lying in the proper interval, irrespective of primality. The probability that `q` is prime is approximately `1` in `log(2k)=k×log(2)`. Next, note that `p` has approximately `2048-k` bits. The probability that such a number is prime is approximately `1` in `log(22048-k)=(2048-k)×log(2)`. This means that we have to generate approximately `2k-208×k×(2048-k)×(log(2))2` numbers `q` of `k` bits before we can expect one hit. In only `k×(2048-k)×(log(2))2` cases we have to test a `k` bit number for primality, and in only `(2048-k)×log(2)` cases we have to test a `2048-`  bit number for primality. We chose `k=224`, which turned out to be doable in practice. The time required for computing this secure modulus was a couple of minutes only on a standard PC.  The resulting RSA modulus thus is rather unbalanced: its prime factors have 1824 and 224 bits respectively. This is estimated to be just out of reach of current factoring methods, in particular ECM.  Note that the private key corresponding to the real certificate is used only for signing the CSR, and that the real certificate itself is used only for providing us with a valid signature. This certificate and corresponding key pair will never be used in some real application, though such use would in principle not harm anybody. An interesting consequence of this is that the creation of a secure RSA modulus is not necessary at all, we could have taken any number for `n` of which we know the factorisation, such that `φ(n)` is coprime to our public exponent 65537. The reason that we need the factorisation is that we need to compute the private exponent, as we have to sign the CSR. There is even no need for `n` to be a product of two primes, having a prime or any kind of factorisation would also do. Nevertheless we chose to be careful here too, and to make it a secure RSA modulus of which the private key will be kept secret as well.  An interesting point to make is that the "path length" field in the "basic constraints" field of the CA's root certificate is not set. The path length field is the maximum number of intermediate CA levels in the CA hierarchy that this CA will allow between its own level and the end user level. If the CA would have set the path length to 0, then applications checking for the path length would have rejected certificates signed by our rogue CA, as there the path length is 1: our rogue CA is at the level between the end user certificate and the root CA certificate.  For the collision construction it is absolutely necessary that we are able to predict at bit level the entire contents of the "to-be-signed" part of the certificate up to the point where the collision block starts. The only fields that are not either constant, or directly controlled by us are the validity period and the serial number. However, using the techniques described in [section 5.2](index.html#sec52), we were able to predict the values of these two fields. | |  |  |  | | 5.3.2. The rogue CA certificate |  | The structure of the "to-be-signed" part of the rogue CA certificate is chosen by us (but of course within the limits of the X.509 standard), to facilitate the collision construction process. Here the only field prescribed by the CA is the issuer Distinguished Name. The structure of the rogue CA certificate is as follows:  | byte 0 - 3: | header | | --- | --- | | byte 4 - 8: | version number (3, default value) | | byte 9 - 11: | serial number (65, arbitrary choice) | | byte 12 - 26: | signature algorithm ("md5withRSAEncryption", set by us in the CSR) | | byte 27 - 118: | issuer Distinguished Name (CA default value) | | byte 119 - 150: | validity ("from 31 Jul. 2004 0:00:00 to 2 Sep. 2004 0:00:00") | | byte 153 - 212: | subject Distinguished Name (Common Name = "MD5 Collisions Inc. (http://www.phreedom.org/md5)") | | byte 213 - 374: | subject public key info:  | byte 213 - 215: | header | | --- | --- | | byte 216 - 230: | public key algorithm ("RSAEncryption") | | byte 231 - 237: | headers | | byte 238 - 369: | RSA modulus (1024 bit value) | | byte 370 - 374: | RSA public exponent (65537) | | | byte 375 - 926: | extensions:  | byte 375 - 378: | headers | | --- | --- | | byte 379 - 395: | key usage ("digital signature, nonrepudiation, certificate signing, offline CRL signing, CRL signing") | | byte 396 - 412: | basic constraints ("CA = TRUE, Path Length = None") | | byte 413 - 476: | subject key identifier, authority key identifier (uninteresting fields) | | byte 477 - 926: | tumor (Netscape extension) | |  The field that makes this certificate a "CA certificate" is the "basic constraints" fields, with the value "CA = TRUE".  The RSA key pair, of which the public key is inside the rogue CA certificate, was generated by OpenSSL in a standard key pair generation process. The private key is kept in a safe place and we're not planning on releasing it publicly. This private key is required for issuing end user certificates signed by the rogue CA, so this is quite sensitive.  To minimize this danger, the validity period of the rogue CA certificate is set to a relatively short period in the year 2004 (the month August 2004, when Xiaoyun Wang presented the first MD5 collision at the Crypto Conference in Santa Barbara). This backdating is done on purpose. It means that even if the private key to our rogue CA certificate falls into the wrong hands, the certificate would be rejected by all common browsers because of its expiration date, except when the system clock of the user's computer would be set back to within this short period in 2004. The probability that this will happen unintentionally is negligible.  Note that the serial number we have chosen is a rather low one. We do not know whether an actual certificate issued by this CA with this serial number was already in existence. We took a low number because that most probably implies that a possible other certificate with that serial number has already expired a long time ago. | |  |  |  | | 5.3.3. Alignment |  | The bytes 0 - 473 in the real certificate (the fields up to the modulus, and the first 5 bytes of the modulus field which are a predictable header) are pretty much fixed by CA requirements. Those 474 bytes form the "chosen prefix" on the real certificate's side. For this certificate we chose to have a 2048 bit RSA key. The main reason for this size is the fact that we have to hide the collision block in there. Our collision construction method enables us to make collision blocks of 1632 bits, so 2048 seems a reasonable choice. Moreover 2048 bit RSA moduli are quite common, so no suspicion is raised.  At the side of the rogue certificate we could not use the public key modulus for hiding the collision block. The reason for this is that we want to set the CA flag in the "basic constraints" field to the value "TRUE", contrary to the corresponding field in the real certificate. The problem is that this "basic constraints" field occurs after the public key, and with the type of collisions we have, we cannot allow any bit difference after the collision block. So in the rogue CA certificate, both the public key and the extensions up to the "basic constraints" field have to be placed before the collision block starts.  To accomplish this, it was helpful that the subject Distinguished Name in the real certificate has considerable length, that can easily be stretched by choosing an appropriately sized Common Name. At the same time we took the subject Distinguished Name in the rogue CA certificate as short as possible, to allow sufficient space for a full 1024 bit public key and the "basic constraints" field, all this to be placed in the area corresponding to the subject Distinguished Name field of the real certificate. In this way all necessary fields belonging to the "chosen prefix" of the rogue CA certificate could be placed in the first 477 bytes of the "to-be-signed" part.  The next problem that had to be solved is that we need a field in the extensions of the rogue CA certificate in which we have to hide at least 3 × 512 + 96 = 1632 bits (204 bytes) of the collision block. This is random looking data, over which we do not have much control, as this data comes out of the collision construction method, and we do not control that enough to be able to make such a block with some real world interpretation. And we have one more problem, as all data after the public key from the real certificate needs to be copied bitwise into the rogue CA certificate. This data does have an interpretation relevant to the real certificate, but this interpretation most probably is not relevant, even disturbing, for the rogue CA certificate. Together those fields have a considerable size, namely 427 bytes.  These two problems together ask for a place in the rogue CA certificate to hide 427 bytes of data in, some of which are random looking, and some of which have an interpretation that should not be shown in certificate viewers. The solution we adopted is to define a so called "Netscape Comment" block. This is a proprietary extension in which any data can be stored, which will be ignored by most certificate processing applications, including the major browsers. There is a small problem here in that formally the contents of this field must be of type IA5String, and our content is not of that form. An ASN.1 parser that strictly follows the standard will complain about this, as happens e.g. with Peter Gutmann's program "dumpasn1". But as most application software ignores the extension anyway, the certificate with this standard violating field in it will still be accepted in practice. It is conceivable that the 427 bytes could have been hidden in a different extension field (there is even an [X.509 certificate with a movie hidden inside](http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/dave.der)).  The Netscape Comment extension requires a header of 23 bytes. So the contents of the extension will start at byte 500, and that now can become exactly the spot where the birthday bits start, in both certificates. This explains the fact that in the real certificate, where the modulus starts at byte 474, there are first 26 random bytes to fill up the space. In a technical sense the "chosen prefixes" of the two certificates end at byte 499. The collision block starts at byte 500. This collision block consists, as said before, of 96 + 3 × 512 = 1632 bits = 204 bytes, so it ends at byte 703.  So from byte 500 until byte 926 there are 427 bytes inside the rogue CA certificate that are quite meaningless to the certificate itself. We call this big, seemingly unnecessary block of data a "tumor". From our point of view it's a benign one.  We start the modulus of the public key of the real certificate at byte 474. As explained above, for alignment with the rogue CA certificate we need to fill up the first 26 bytes somehow, so we just chose 26 random bytes to start the modulus with. We have to think in terms of blocks of 64 bytes, as MD5 splits up the input in 512 bit blocks. So we now have 12 bytes left until the next 512 bit block starts with a new `IHV` value.  So at byte 500 of the "to-be-signed" part we have reached the stage where in the real certificate we are inside the modulus, and in the rogue CA certificate we are inside the tumor.  The MD5 collision construction method we used consists of two stages: a "birthdaying" stage and a "near collision" stage. The birthdaying stage is meant to prepare the next difference in `IHV`s between the two certificates, at the border between two 512 bit blocks. Thus we have 12 bytes, i.e. 96 bits, available for those birthday bits. This is, due to improvements in the birthdaying procedure, more than enough. In fact, we needed only 72 bits for our new technique of birthdaying, so of the 12 available bytes three were simply set to 0. Note that, by their very nature, these 72 birthday bits are completely different in both certificates, and look completely random. These birthday bits were computed by our collision finding programs, for details see below.  Then there are three MD5 input blocks of 512 bits each, i.e. 3 × 64 bytes, byte numbers 512 to 703. Each of the three input blocks was constructed by our collision finding method to cancel out certain differences in the `IHV`s. Contrary to the birthday bits, these near collision blocks differ only in one or two bits. At the end of the third block the difference has vanished entirely, thus constituting a collision for the MD5 compression function. From byte 704 on the certificates are exactly, i.e. bitwise, identical.  In the real certificate we now have 26 + 12 + 3 × 64 = 230 bytes of the modulus. The remaining 26 bytes of the modulus were computed to ensure that it's a secure RSA modulus, as explained above.  Then in the real certificate the public exponent and all "version 3 extensions" follow. In total this required 197 bytes. They were generated in the real certificate by the CA, and then simply copied into the tumor in the rogue CA certificate. One of the fields in there is the "basic constraints" field, set to "CA = FALSE". Interestingly enough, the bytes of this field are also present in the tumor, but the certificate processing software will not recognize them as having any interpretation attached to them, as they are part of the tumor.  After the extensions in the real certificate and the tumor in the rogue CA certificate have ended, at byte 926, the "to-be-signed" part of the certificates are finished, and the MD5 hash function can be called on these 926 byte long strings to produce the colliding value.  What finally follows inside the certificate are the "signature algorithm" field and the "signature" field. Naturally, those fields are identical in both the certificates.

The differences in the MD5 `IHV`s are depicted in the following image.    Each line represents the 128 bits of one `IHV` difference (this time not the XOR difference but the difference in non-adjacent form for 32 bit words; a black pixel stands for no difference, a blue pixel stands for a +1 difference, an orange pixel stands for a -1 difference). It is clear that the `IHV` difference looks random in `IHV1` to `IHV7`, gets special in `IHV8` (this is due to the birthdaying), and then gets canceled out piece by piece in the next three input blocks, so that it has completely vanished in `IHV11`. | |  |  |  | | 5.3.4. Collision construction |  | The first part of the method prepares the `IHV` difference so that it becomes suitable for the second part. This is simply done by a birthday search for an input pair that has an `IHV` difference with the proper structure. Optimization of the trade-off between the number of birthday bits and the number of near collision blocks is another item that is discussed in the paper [[SSALMOW]](index.html#Ref). In the case at hand we decided to choose for 72 birthday bits and 3 near collision blocks. The computational bottleneck is the birthday search.  To illustrate the collision construction we have made some nice pictures of bit differences in the internal states of MD5.    The entire inputs for MD5 consist of pairs of 15 input blocks of 512 bits each. In each compression function call the input `IHV` is put into an internal state of 128 bits. The compression function performs 64 rounds, in each round updating the state, using some bits from the input block. After the 64th round the internal state is XORed with the input `IHV` to produce the output `IHV`.  In the pictures above and to the right the differences between `IHV`s and the 64 internal states in between the rounds are shown. Here each time the difference between the two input files are taken. These differences are computed in non-adjacent form for 32 bit words. Each line in the pictures shows the 128 bits of an `IHV`or an internal state difference. In the animated picture above the first line, above the yellow division line at the top, shows the input `IHV` difference, the last line, below the yellow division line at the bottom, shows the output `IHV` difference, and the 64 lines in between the yellow division lines show the 64 internal state differences after each round. the animation shows the processing of the 15 compression function calls one at a time. The picture to the right shows the same data in one big row rather than animated. Note that each output `IHV` is the input `IHV` for the next compression function call. | |  |  | --- | | 5.4. Real life execution |  | For one single attempt to obtain a CA signature we had to guess the serial number and the validity period the CA was going to use a few days in advance. This information is crucial to get the chosen prefix for the real certificate's "to-be-signed" part, and this is input for the collision construction method. Once a collision has been found, the public key modulus has to be computed. Then the Certificate Signing Request could be composed and sent to the CA at the precise time, and then we had to wait for the CA to return a signed certificate, and see if the serial number and validity period were guessed correctly.  We performed our attemps over the weekend to take advantage of the lower load of the CA. Each weekend we would generate from one to three collisions with serial numbers within the predicted range and purchase enough certificates to increment the serial number up to the desired value. Unfortunately, the first three tries failed due to timing issues.  We received a couple of certificates signed only a second too late and a number of times requests by other customers of the CA interfered with our attempts to get the right serial number. Finally, on the fourth weekend we succeeded in getting a certificate with the right serial number signed at the right time.  Each certificate we purchased from RapidSSL cost us USD 45. However, the CA allowed us to reissue each certificate up to 20 times for free, which meant that a single certificate request cost us only USD 2.25. In total, we spent USD 657 on purchasing certificates for this project. | |  |  | --- | | 5.5. Results |  | The results of executing our scenario are two certificates. We make them available for download in the common .cer and .pem formats. Moreover we give the output of the ["dumpasn1"](http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/dumpasn1.c) program applied to the certificates, to presents the certificate structure in a more readable form.  * [real certificate (.cer)](downloads/real.cert.cer)* [real certificate (.pem)](downloads/real.cert.pem.html)* [real certificate (output of dumpasn1)](downloads/real.cert.txt)* [rogue CA certificate (.cer)](downloads/rogue_ca.cert.cer)* [rogue CA certificate (.pem)](downloads/rogue_ca.cert.pem.html)* [rogue CA certificate (output of dumpasn1)](downloads/rogue_ca.cert.txt)  The private key for the certificate is not available for download, but this should not prevent anybody from verifying the authenticity of our certificate. | |  |  | --- | | 5.6. Demonstration |  | Here you can download in different formats the example website certificate signed by our rogue CA:  * [example website certificate signed by the rogue certificate (.cer)](downloads/website_localhost.cer)* [example website certificate signed by the rogue certificate (.pem)](downloads/website_localhost.pem.html)* [example website certificate signed by the rogue certificate (output of dumpasn1)](downloads/website_localhost.txt) | | --- |  | --- | | **6. Impact** |  | A short summary of our result is that we have come in possession of a "rogue" Certification Authority whose certificate will be accepted by default by most browsers. Thus we are able to issue SSL certificates to any website we like, including rogue websites claiming to be legitimate ones.  This has been possible by exploiting the following weaknesses:  * an efficient method to construct "chosen-prefix collisions" for   the MD5 hash function,* there is at least one commercial Certification Authority that:     + issues certificates with a signature created using the MD5 hash function,+ processes online requests for certificates in an automated way,+ does not check for anomalous requests,+ allows predicting with reasonable probability of success a valid             combination of serial number and validity period,+ has no technically enforced limit on the length of a               chain of certificates.  Any website, whether it is secure (i.e. uses SSL) or not, whether it has an MD5-based, SHA-1-based, SHA-256-based, or any other type of certificate, irrespective of which Certification Authority issued the certificate, can be impersonated, in particular not only genuine websites that have an MD5-based certificate are vulnerable.  The rogue Certification Authority we have has been set up for demonstration purposes only. Its certificate has on purpose been backdated, so that it will be recognized by browsers as having expired more that 4 years ago. Moreover the corresponding private key, needed to issue certificates with, will be kept in a safe place to prevent abuse. Thus it is unlikely that with this particular rogue Certification Authority harm can be done.  However, we have shown that it is possible in practice, with some non-negligible but doable effort, to set up such a rogue Certification Authority. If we can do it now, others will be capable of doing it as well in the foreseeable future. In theory it is even conceivable that other groups or individuals already have developed similar skills and knowledge as we have, and are already able to impersonate websites at their will. We have no indication that this is actually the case. Because of this we believe it is important to stop using MD5 as soon as possible.  In combination with known weaknesses in the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol such as Kaminsky's "DNS Flaw" [[K2]](index.html#Ref) (see also [[OMM]](index.html#Ref)), the vulnerability we exposed opens the door to virtually undetectable phishing attacks. Without being aware of it, users can be redirected to malicious sites that appear exactly the same as the trusted banking or e-commerce websites they believe to be visiting. User passwords and other private data can fall into wrong hands.  We do not want to help persons with criminal intent. Therefore we will for the time being not release the full details of how we have been able to obtain the rogue Certification Authority certificate. It should however be noted that the basic principles of constructing "chosen-prefix collisions" for MD5 were published already in May 2007, see [[SLW]](index.html#Ref), and the ["Chosen-prefix collisions"](../ChosenPrefixCollisions.html) website. To make our present results possible these publicly known techniques have been improved at crucial points. These improvements are published in an academic paper [[SSALMOW]](index.html#Ref). Apart from that, somebody who wants to redo our work has to do considerable implementation and optimization efforts. For the time being we do not plan to release such implementation details.  Other applications than secure web communication using SSL might be vulnerable as well. Every Certification Authority that will honor requests for MD5-based certificates and that has sufficiently predictable serial numbers and validity periods, may be vulnerable to similar attacks. This may include Certification Authorities in the areas of e-mail signing and encryption, software signing, non-repudiation services, etc.  We feel safe to say that the impact of our work is very limited in the sense that we think it is highly unlikely that our rogue Certification Authority can be abused by anyone (including ourselves!). We have released sufficient detail of our methods to show that we have a realistic attack scenario. The proof of the pudding is our colliding certificates, available for download on this website, so that everyone can verify our claims, and in the demonstration we have provided. Our intent is to raise awareness that MD5 is broken so drastically that its continued use in digital signature schemes and certificates poses realistic threats.  Our desired impact is that Certification Authorities will stop using MD5 in issuing new certificates. We also hope that use of MD5 in other applications will be reconsidered as well. Proper alternatives are readily available. | | --- |  | --- | | 6.1. Revocation issues |  | One interesting observation from our work is that the rogue certificate we have created is very hard to revoke using the revocation mechanism available in common browsers. There are two protocols for certificate revocation, CRL and OSCP. Until Firefox 3 and IE 7, certificate revocation was disabled by default. Even in the latest versions, the browsers rely on the certificate to include a URL pointing to a revocation server. Our rogue CA certificate had very limited space and it was impossible to include such a URL, which means that by default both Internet Explorer and Firefox are unable to find a revocation server to check our certificate against.  As a workaround, system admistrators can configure the browsers to always query a company-specific OSCP server for revocation information, but this option is not easily usable by individual end users. This points out an important problem that still needs to be resolved, in case similar attacks result in certificates that need to be revoked in the future.  Another interesting scenario is that our result opens possibilities for Denial of Service attacks on existing Certification Authorities. If an attacker wants to have somebody's certificate revoked (e.g. of a competing web shop), he can use our techniques to obtain a rogue certificate from the same Certification Authority, which has the same serial number as the target certificate. As soon as this rogue certificate gets published, the Certification Authority has no choice but to revoke it. Since revocation happens only on the basis of the serial number of the certificate, at the same time the legitimate certificate of the victim will be revoked. This attack will become extremely powerful if the root certificate of the Certification Authority is targeted. An attacker can thus force revocation of this root certificate, and with that of the entire certificate tree depending on it. | | --- |  | --- | | **7. Countermeasures** |  | First and foremost, there is no proper excuse for continued use of a broken cryptographic primitive when sufficiently strong alternatives are readily available, for example SHA-2.  Secondly, there is no substitute for security awareness. Openness about security problems, vulnerabilities and technical possibilities is invaluable to make the Internet a safer place. Advice from experts should be taken seriously and early in the process. In this case, MD5 should have been phased out soon after 2004.  This being said, we continue discussing countermeasures that can be taken by different stakeholders.    When MD5 has been used, fraud may be detected by inspection of the certificate at bit level. When the certificate has a "tumor" inside, this may or may not be shown in a user friendly certificate viewer. See the picture on the left, where there is a strange "Netscape comment" field with the value 3. Actually this is a 427 byte field that for technical reasons cannot be shown on screen in this viewer. An expert who can inspect the certificate with tools such as ["dumpasn1"](http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/dumpasn1.c), will be able to identify such a strange field in the certificate. However, a standard user will likely not notice anything. Therefore inspection of certificates is not a strong countermeasure.  Preventive countermeasures are much more powerful. We now describe the preventive countermeasures that CAs and browser vendors can take, but users cannot.  **Certification Authorities** are recommended to stop using MD5 altogether. To prevent chosen prefix attacks, they can add a sufficient amount of randomness to the certificate fields, preferably as far to the start of the certificate as possible. The serial number is a good field to use for this, as it comes very close to the beginning of the certificate, and it allows for 20 bytes of randomness. Many Certification Authorities seem to use already random serial numbers, albeit probably for different reasons. The German Signature Law prescribes random serial numbers for qualified SHA-1 certificates (see [[B]](index.html#Ref)) to provide some randomness in the hash input. We do note however that this use of randomness in the serial number is a workaround, made possible by lucky choices in the X.509 standard. It is not a bad idea in general to add randomness to a hash input when a possible attacker is able to choose the input. A much more reliable, since designed, solution is to use randomized hashing, see [[HK]](index.html#Ref) for a paper, and [[BS]](index.html#Ref) for an implementation in Firefox. Such a solution introduces ramdomization as a "mode of operation" for hash functions, which is a much more fundamental approach to the problem than relying on features that happen to be present in existing standards for non-security reasons, or for no reason at all.  Other measures a Certification Authority may take are to make active use of the "pathlength" parameter in the "basic constraints" field. When a CA has the policy of only issuing end user certificates, this policy can be enforced technically by setting the path length to 0. Our specific attack scenario can be detected because there is a three-level hierarchy (see the upper picture). This detection can however be avoided by a small variant of our attack scenario, where the rogue colliding certificate is not a CA certificate but a website certificate in itself (see the lower picture). We note that such a rogue colliding end user certificate may be constructed without a tumor: the collision block can then be hidden again inside the public key. This makes detection much more difficult. Other ways of formatting the certificate may be possible.  An interesting question is whether CAs should revoke existing certificates signed using MD5. One may argue that the present attack scenario has in principle been possible since May 2007, and that therefore all certificates (or all CA certificates) signed with MD5 that have been issued after this date may have been compromised. Whether they really have been compromised is not relevant. What is relevant is that the relying party who needs to trust the certificate does not have a proper way of checking whether the certificate is to be trusted or not. One may even argue that all older certificates based on MD5 should be revoked, as for an attacker constructing rogue certificates it is easy to backdate them to any date in the past he likes, so any MD5-based certificate may be a forgery. On the other hand, one may argue that the likelihood of these scenarios is quite small, and that the cost of replacing many MD5-based certificates may be substantial, so that therefore the risks of continued use of existing MD5-based certificates may be seen as acceptable. Regardless, MD5 should no longer be used for new certificates.  Finally, Certification Authorities can monitor the flow of Certificate Signing Requests that they receive for abnormal series of requests, such as many requests by the same user in quick succession.  **Browser and Operating System vendors** such as Microsoft (vendor of Windows and Internet Explorer) and Mozilla (vendor of Firefox) can implement pop-up warnings to the users when an MD5-based certificate is encountered. Blocking MD5-based certificates is also possible, but rather drastic. Browser vendors can implement path length checking. Furthermore, it is the browser vendors who determine which Certification Authorities are present in the trust lists inside the browsers or operating systems. This puts them in a good position to put pressure on the Certification Authorities to adopt proper procedures and use strong cryptographic primitives. We have contacted the mentioned browser vendors so that they are aware of the problem.  **Website owners** can check whether their Certification Authority has proper procedures, notably does not use unacceptable hash functions such as MD5. Website owners can ask their CAs to switch to more secure hash functions such as SHA-2. | |  |  | --- | | 7.1.

Frequently asked questions** |  | **Question.** Can your proof of concept rogue CA certificate be misused? **Answer.** This is highly unlikely. We intentionally set the expiration date of our rogue CA certificate to August 2004. Any certificate signed by our rogue CA will similarly be invalid after August 2004. This allows us to test our proof of concept certificate by setting the system date back to August 2004, but prevents the certificate from being misused if it ever falls into the wrong hands. If your system date is correct, your web browser will notify you that the certificate is invalid because it has expired, effectively warning you that that website should not be trusted. The validity period of the certificate is sufficiently short to make it most unlikely that the system clock of your computer is accidentally set back to this time.  **Question.** Are all digital certificates/signatures broken?  **Answer.** No. When digital certificates and signatures are based on secure cryptographic hash functions, our work yields no reason to doubt their security. Our result only applies when digital certificates are signed using the hash function MD5, which is known to be broken. With our method it is only possible to copy digital signatures based on MD5 between two specially constructed digital certificates. It is not possible to copy digital signatures based on MD5 from digital certificates unless the certificates are specially constructed. Even so, our result shows that MD5 is NOT suited for digital signatures. Certification Authorities should stop using the known broken MD5 and move to the widely available, more secure alternatives, such as SHA-2.  **Question.** What is the status of collision attacks for SHA-1? **Answer.** As far as we know the only group seriously working on collision attacks for SHA-1 is in Graz, Austria, see their website ["SHA-1 Collision Search"](http://www.iaik.tugraz.at/content/research/krypto/sha1/). Status of the theory: at the Rump Session of Crypto 2007 they estimated the complexity of their attack for collisions with identical initial `IHV`s to be `<261` calls to the compression function. For chosen-prefix collisions they estimated in 2006 a complexity of just below the birthday bound of `280`. Improvements on the latter result are probably possible, but nobody has looked into this. Status of experiments: Since mid 2007 the people in Graz are running a distributed [SHA-1 Collision Search BOINC project](http://boinc.iaik.tugraz.at/), aiming at finding a SHA-1 collision with identical initial `IHV`s. They estimate (private communication) that now (December 2008, so after 1.5 years) they have covered less that 10% of the search space. So they need your spare cycles.  **Question.** Suppose that a criminal creates by our method his own rogue Certification Authority that is trusted by all browsers. Are then only websites with certificates from the CA whose signature he used vulnerable to impersonation attacks? Are only websites with certificates based on MD5 vulnerable to impersonation attacks? **Answer.** No. When a criminal uses redirection attacks in combination with a rogue but trusted CA certificate, all websites are equally vulnerable.  **Question.** What should websites do that have digital certificates signed with MD5? **Answer.** Nothing at this point. Digital certificates legitimately obtained from all CAs can be believed to be secure and trusted, even if they were signed with MD5. Our method required the purchase of a specially crafted digital certificate from a CA and does not affect certificates issued to any other regular website.  **Question.** Where does the title "MD5 considered harmful today" of this website come from? **Answer.** In December 2004, shortly after MD5 collisions were found, Dan Kaminsky came with an exploit for them. His paper is entitled "MD5 to be considered harmful someday", see [[K1]](index.html#Ref). We think this day has come.  **Question.** When and where will the paper with details on the chosen-prefix collision construction method be published? **Answer.** A paper [[SSALMOW]](index.html#Ref) on the improvements on the MD5 chosen-prefix collision construction method is available as of March 11, 2009. This paper will appear in the proceedings of [Crypto 2009](http://www.iacr.org/conferences/crypto2009/).  A full paper [[SLW2]](index.html#Ref) on the MD5 chosen-prefix collision construction method is available as of June 16, 2009.  **Question.** Will source and/or executable code of the chosen-prefix collision construction method be made public? **Answer.** For the time being we have no such plans.  [added June 16, 2009] But plans change, because the world changes. Almost half a year since the major CAs have moved away from MD5, we think it's safe to publish code. See Marc Stevens' code page [hashclash - Framework for MD5 Differential Path Construction and Chosen-Prefix Collisions](http://code.google.com/p/hashclash/).  **Question.** How do we know that the CAs still using MD5 havent already been attacked by somebody else? **Answer.** Given the time and resources we needed to construct our proof of concept and the advanced mathematics required to implement our method, it is our opinion that it is unlikely this has happened already. However, because our proof of concept shows that it is possible, there is no 100% guarantee.  **Question.** What are the known weaknesses in DNS that you refer to in the press release? **Answer.** The DNS spoofing vulnerability discovered by Dan Kaminsky in 2008 allows an attacker to redirect requests for any website to a web server controlled by them. For more information, please see [[K2]](index.html#Ref) and [[OMM]](index.html#Ref). The SSL protocol used for secure websites is supposed to detect this kind of attack because the attacker would not have a legitimate digital certificate for the hijacked website. However, the MD5 collision attack we discovered allows attackers to create arbitrary trusted digital certificates and allows them to hijack any secure website on the Internet if the users DNS servers are not patched against the DNS spoofing vulnerability.  **Question.** How much did your proof of concept research cost? **Answer.** It took a few months to design and implement our method, based on a lot of knowledge and skills that we have developed over the last two years. We spent about USD 700 on purchasing test certificates from a CA. The computations needed for our work were done on a cluster of about 200 PlayStation 3 game consoles in the cryptanalytic lab at EPFL.  **Question.** Why were game consoles used? What other hardware is suitable? **Answer.** Game consoles use hardware specialized for the computational needs of the detailed 3D graphics in games. This hardware is also very suited for the basic arithmetic used in cryptographic algorithms and greatly outperforms general purpose computers on brute-force computations. We have found that one PlayStation 3 game console is equivalent to about 40 modern single core processors. The most computationally intensive part of our method required about 3 days of work with over 200 game consoles, which is equivalent to 32 years of computing on a typical desktop computer. Common graphic cards have been used by [some](http://www.elcomsoft.com/edpr.html) for MD5 cryptanalysis as well.  **Question.** How long would it take for someone else to try and imitate you? **Answer.** The basic theory behind our work was published in 2007, but we have made a lot of improvements that are not yet in the literature. We estimate that a team of highly skilled researchers and programmers who have prior experience in this area would need at least a month to duplicate our work. Starting from scratch without prior understanding of the MD5 collision techniques would be far more challenging and would take significantly longer. In addition to cryptographic research and development expertise, access to significant computational resources is needed. Regardless of how long it would take to reproduce our work, MD5 should no longer be used for certificates.  [added June 16, 2009] Since we have now released full details and code, the answer above is of historic interest only.  **Question.** What is the best way to ensure that the attack scenario we developed is not possible in the future? **Answer.** Stop using MD5 as soon as possible, and migrate to (more) secure cryptographic hash functions. | | --- |  | --- | | **Authors** |  | left to right: Benne, Arjen, Marc, Jake, David, Alex (missing: Dag Arne) (photo: Alexander Klink) | |  |  |  | |  |  | **Alexander Sotirov** Independent security researcher, New York, USA <http://www.phreedom.org/> | |  |  |  | |  |  | **Marc Stevens** Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), Amsterdam, The Netherlands <http://homepages.cwi.nl/~stevens/> News at the CWI website: [English](http://www.cwi.nl/nl/node/839), [Nederlands](http://www.cwi.nl/en/node/838). | |  |  |  | |  |  | **Jacob Appelbaum** Noisebridge, The Tor Project, San Francisco, USA <http://www.appelbaum.net/> | |  |  |  | |  |  | **Arjen Lenstra** LACAL - LAboratory for Cryptologic ALgorithms, EPFL - École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland <http://people.epfl.ch/arjen.lenstra> | |  |  |  | |  |  | **David Molnar** Computer Science Division, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, USA <http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~dmolnar/> | |  |  |  | |  |  | **Dag Arne Osvik** LACAL - LAboratory for Cryptologic ALgorithms, EPFL - École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne Lausanne, Switzerland <http://people.epfl.ch/dagarne.osvik> | |  |  |  | |  |  | **Benne de Weger** EiPSI - Eindhoven Institute for the Protection of Systems and Information, TU/e - Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands <https://www.win.tue.nl/~bdeweger/> | | --- |  | --- | | **Information** |  | For press and general inquiries, please email md5-collisions@phreedom.org.

Our research team, consisting of 7 researchers from the United States,
Switzerland and the Netherlands, was able to execute a practical MD5 collision
attack and create a rogue Certification Authority trusted by all common web
browsers. This allows us to perform transparent man-in-the-middle attacks
against SSL connections and monitor or tamper with the traffic to secure
websites or email servers.
The infrastructure of Certification Authorities is meant to prevent exactly
this type of attack. Our work shows that known weaknesses in the MD5 hash
function can be exploited in realistic attack, due to the fact that even after
years of warnings about the lack of security of MD5, some root CAs are still
using this broken hash function.

## MD5 vulnerable to collision attacks

#### Vulnerability Note VU#836068

Original Release Date: 2008-12-31 | Last Revised: 2009-01-21

---

### Overview

Weaknesses in the MD5 algorithm allow for collisions in output. As a result, attackers can generate cryptographic tokens or other data that illegitimately appear to be authentic.

### Description

| A secure cryptographic hash algorithm is one that generates a unique identifier of a fixed size (known as a "digest" or simply "hash") for a block of data of arbitrary size. The MD5 algorithm is a standard, widely used example of such an algorithm and is defined in IETF [RFC 1321](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1321). One of the requirements of secure cryptographic hash algorithms is that it be extremely unlikely for two different inputs to the algorithm to generate the same digest. This property is generally referred to as *collision resistance* and cases where an algorithm generates the same digest for two different blocks of data are known as *collisions*.  Cryptanalytic research published in [1996](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/dobbertin96cryptanalysis.html) described a weakness in the MD5 algorithm that could result in collision attacks, at least in principle. Further research published in [2004](http://eprint.iacr.org/2004/199) demonstrated the practical ability for an attacker to generate collisions and in [2005](http://eprint.iacr.org/2005/067) the ability for an attacker to generate colliding x.509 certificates was demonstrated. In [2008](http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/), researchers demonstrated the practical vulnerability of Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) to such attacks, including the construction of an SSL certificate that allows an attacker to impersonate a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA). Most operating systems bundle a collection of trusted CA certificates, including some that use the MD5 signing algorithm, providing obvious targets for attackers to spoof. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can construct forged data in a variety of forms that will cause software using the MD5 algorithm to incorrectly identify it as trustworthy. Because the underlying vulnerability occurs in a cryptographic primitive, specific exploitation scenarios vary widely depending on the nature of the data the attacker has the ability to spoof and how it is validated by software. In a particularly egregious vulnerability scenario, a victim user may be mislead into supplying sensitive information to a malicious website believing that it is authentic based on an apparently valid signed SSL certificate. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Do not use the MD5 algorithm**Software developers, Certification Authorities, website owners, and users should avoid using the MD5 algorithm in any capacity. As previous research has demonstrated, it should be considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use.**Scrutinize SSL certificates signed by certificates using the MD5 algorithm**Users may wish to manually analyze the properties of web site certificates that are signed by signing certificates using the MD5 algorithm. The procedures for accessing certificate details differ depending on the software in use but the signature algorithm is often identified in the "Signature algorithm", "Certificate Signature Algorithm", or similarly named field. Users of systems with the OpenSSL command line utility can view certificate properties using "openssl x509 -text" or a similar utility. Certificates listed as md5RSA or similar are affected. Such certificates that include strange or suspicious fields or other anomalies may be fraudulent. Because there are no reliable signs of tampering it must be noted that this workaround is error-prone and impractical for most users. |

| Vulnerability of software integrity and code signing applications to chosen-prefix collisions for MD5**November 30, 2007** |  | | Marc Stevens | Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica, Amsterdam Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica | | --- | --- | | Arjen Lenstra | École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne Bell Labs EPFL and Bell Labs | | Benne de Weger | Technische Universiteit Eindhoven | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| --- |  | --- |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Announcement** |  | **We announce two different Win32 executable files with different functionality but identical MD5 hash values. This shows that trust in MD5 as a tool for verifying software integrity, and as a hash function used in code signing, has become questionable.** |
| --- |  | --- |
| **Software Integrity Checksums** |  | Software is vulnerable to threats on its *integrity*. For example, when a program is made available as an executable file on the web for downloading, some bits of the file may be accidentally changed during the download process. Or, when a program is stored on a hard disk that becomes victim to a virus attack, the program code may be changed on purpose, to get an executable file that has been infected by the virus. A popular method of thwarting those threats is to compute a *checksum* of the original executable file, and to publish this checksum along with the program on the download webpage, or to store this checksum in a database. At any later moment the user of the program is then able to recompute the checksum from the file as it is then residing on his computer, and verify the checksum with the stored original value. When the checksum has changed, apparently the file has changed, and should not be trusted any longer. |
| **Code Signing** |  | Software vendors have set up *code signing* schemes to assist users in distinguishing software coming from a trusted source from malware. A public key signature scheme based on PKI (*Public Key Infrastructure*) is used to provide the user, along with the software itself, with a *digital signature* of the software. Such a signature is unforgeable in a strong cryptographic sense, as it has been constructed using the software vendors private key. The users can verify this signature using the corresponding public key, usually made available inside a *certificate*. A prime example of such a code signing scheme is [Microsoft Authenticode](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537359.aspx).  Hash functions play an essential role in the process of making digital signatures. The private key operation is not applied directly to the to be signed file, but to a hash value of this file instead. |
| **Cryptographic hash functions** |  | *Cryptographic hash functions* are widely known and easy to calculate functions that are believed to have the property that no two messages with identical hash values can be found. A well known and widely used cryptographic hash function is *MD5*. Especially in software integrity applications and code signing programs MD5 has been a popular hash function for many years now. Many websites making software (source code or executable) available for download provide on the website with the software itself its *MD5 checksum*. Another much used hash function is *SHA-1*. For the last decade MD5 and SHA-1 have been the default choice for hash functions in most code signing schemes. |
| --- |  | --- |
| **Hash functions should be collision resistant** |  | In order for a software integrity checksum or a digital signature based on a hash value to be of any value, the cryptographic hash function that is used must be *collision resistant*. That is, it must be practically impossible to find different messages that have the same hash value. Otherwise, a miscreant can use a single hash value to commit to more than a single file. |
| **MD5 is not collision resistant** |  | The cryptographic hash function MD5 was shown to be not collision resistant, by prof. Xiaoyun Wang and her co-authors, in 2004 (see the EuroCrypt 2005 paper ["How to break MD5 and other hash functions"](http://www.infosec.sdu.edu.cn/paper/md5-attack.pdf)). Although devastating from a theoretical point of view, many practitioners believed that the practical repercussions of prof. Wangs attack would be minimal because of the lack of useful structure of the collisions that could be constructed. |
| **Chosen-prefix collisions** |  | When incorporating collisions into a pair of files, prof. Wang's original method of constructing collisions required the files to be exactly equal, except for the relatively small random looking block of bytes comprising the collision. Last year we showed, with the kind assistance of prof. Wang, how her attack on MD5 can be improved to provide [*chosen-prefix collisions*](../ChosenPrefixCollisions.html). Our chosen-prefix collisions have only the requirement that *after* the collision the files should be exactly equal. *Before* the collision the two files, for which a collision is to be found, can be anything: our chosen-prefix collision finding method will always produce a collision that can be incorporated into the two files, irrespective of what data is present before the collision. |
| **Extending executables** |  | Eric Verheul pointed out to us that random bytes may be appended to various formats, without changing their functionality. This idea also applies to executable files. So, by appending a chosen-prefix collision, any perfectly harmless program can be made to collide with any other program, such as a piece of malware. The two files show unchanged behaviour when executed, one good and the other bad, but now the files have identical MD5 hash values. A digital signature obtained on the harmless program will then be equally valid for the malware. |
| --- |  | --- |
| **Proof of concept** |  | We now present our proof of concept pair of Win32 executable files that have different functionality but identical MD5 hash values. |
| **A good executable** |  | We wrote the program `HelloWorld.cpp`, with the following C++ source code:  | `#include "stdafx.h"` | | --- | | `int main(int argc, char* argv[])` | | `{` | | `printf("Hello World ;-)\n");` | | `return 0;` | | `}` |   As you can see from the source code, it's completely innocent. Here is the  [Win32 executable `HelloWorld.exe`](HelloWorld.exe).  The MD5 hash value of the executable file `HelloWorld.exe` is     `E5F0FC6D3586C4DD15970D5BE7B0B9C7`. |
| **A bad executable** |  | We also wrote the program `GoodbyeWorld.cpp`, with the following C++ source code:  | `#include "stdafx.h"` | | --- | | `int main(int argc, char* argv[])` | | `{` | | `while(true)` | | `printf("Goodbye World :-(\n");` | | `return 0;` | | `}` |   As you can see from the source code, it's not really harmful, just annoying. Here is the  [Win32 executable `GoodbyeWorld.exe`](GoodbyeWorld.exe).  The MD5 hash value of the executable file `GoodbyeWorld.exe` is     `6503BDF2ADCE98B500219640E6CF99CA`.  Building both executables from source code was done by a standard MS Visual C++ installation. |
| **Making the executables collide** |  | As a proof of concept we applied our [chosen-prefix collision finding method](../ChosenPrefixCollisions.html) to the files `HelloWorld.exe` and `GoodbyeWorld.exe`. This came down to carefully constructing two blocks of 832 bytes, and appending them to the end of both files. These 2 times 832 bytes have been constructed such that the resulting files, renamed to `HelloWorld-colliding.exe` and `GoodbyeWorld-colliding.exe`, have exactly identical MD5 hash values. |
| **The colliding executables** |  | Here are the two colliding files, the  [Win32 executable `HelloWorld-colliding.exe`](HelloWorld-colliding.exe), and the  [Win32 executable `GoodbyeWorld-colliding.exe`](GoodbyeWorld-colliding.exe).  `HelloWorld-colliding.exe` has exactly the same good functionality as `HelloWorld.exe`, while `GoodbyeWorld-colliding.exe` has exactly the same annoying functionality as `GoodbyeWorld.exe`.  Though `HelloWorld-colliding.exe` and `GoodbyeWorld-colliding.exe` are different files, containing programs with different functionality, they both have the MD5 hash value     **`18FCC4334F44FED60718E7DACD82DDDF`**. |
| --- |  | --- |
| **Signing the code** |  | To demonstrate the code signing vulnerability, we have set up our own Code Signing Authority, complete with a public key certificate and corresponding private key. Then we signed the colliding executable files using the private key of our Code Signing authority. The signature is `0D4488B0 838D4C50 08DE9F71 14ED9AC1 1A14586F 3A7ADEF1 D5AD5D5E F2B9C5C2 3E98F316 8BCDBD0E 2D07DCFF 011BF918 261AD036 A862FC8E 108A3FBF 0E72D4A6 849F2E9A 1B14102D 291F3804 BFE5BC8A D8051F4B A938EC40 3C91ED99 FBB59F45 3F34E110 EEE2D7EA 7B334874 584CE49C 600084EF 4EA9BA3A C7A9AE65 33478EE8` This signature was made by applying RSA to the standard PKCS#1 padded hash value. |
| --- |  | --- |
| **Verification** |  | You are invited to verify for yourself the following essential points.  | - | the files `HelloWorld.exe` and `HelloWorld-colliding.exe` differ only in that 832 bytes have been appended; | | --- | --- | | - | dito for `GoodbyeWorld.exe` and `GoodbyeWorld-colliding.exe`; | | - | appending those bytes did not change the functionality of the programs, they are normally behaving win32 executables, even though the files `HelloWorld-colliding.exe` and `GoodbyeWorld-colliding.exe` have not been constructed as output of a normal process of building an executable; | | - | the MD5 hash values of `HelloWorld-colliding.exe` and `GoodbyeWorld-colliding.exe` are identical; | | - | the signature is valid for both the colliding files. |  Here is an [OpenSSL recipe](opensslrecipe.txt) for verifying the signature. You will need the [signature in a binary file](sig.bin), the [Code Signing Authority certificate](CSA-certificate.cer) and the [public key file](pubkey.der.html). The CSA-certificate in turn has been issued (i.e. signed) by our own Hash Collision Certification Authority. So the CSA-certificate itself can be validated by the [CA certificate](https://www.win.tue.nl/~bdeweger/CollidingCertificates/MD5CollisionCA.cer).  See also the [output of fciv](allhashes.txt) - Microsoft's File Checksum Integrity Verifier utility.  Here is a [file with all IHVs](allihvs.txt).  Here is a pretty picture showing the bit differences in the internal states of MD5 as it is applied to the two colliding files. |
| --- |  | --- |
| **Vulnerability analysis** |  | It is important to note that the hash value shared by the two different files is a result of the collision construction process. We cannot target a given hash value, and produce a (meaningful) input bit string hashing to that given value. In cryptographic terms: our attack is an attack on collision resistance, not on preimage or second preimage resistance. This implies that both colliding files have to be specially prepared by the attacker, before they are published on a download site or presented for signing by a code signing scheme. Existing files with a known hash that have not been prepared in this way are not vulnerable.  What we can easily do, however, is to do a brute force search on a few additional bytes, to e.g. let the first three and the last three bytes of the hash value match with a given target. This already may introduce an additional vulnerability, as many people (including at least two of us) usually only look at the first and last three bytes when checking a hash value.  For abusing a chosen-prefix collision on a software integrity protection or a code signing scheme, the attacker should be able to manipulate the files before they are being hashed and/or signed. This may mean that the attacker needs insider access to the party operating the trusted software integrity protection or code signing process. An attacker with such access can most probably do more harm anyway, without the need for chosen-prefix collisions, to get ´official´ digital signatures on malware.  On the other hand, there is the viewpoint of the relying party, i.e. the user downloading hashed or signed code who needs some guarantee that this software can be trusted. This relying party can not be sure anymore that the published hash value or the digital signature is valid for only the executable file he downloaded. There might very well be a sibling file with the same hash value or digital signature, while only one of these siblings went through the proper hashing or signing procedure. Especially when the software integrity verification takes place under the hood, with the user not knowing that the operating system or some hidden application is silently verifying digital signatures on software to be installed, the user may be more easily lured into installing malware.  Note that it is not necessary for an attacker to build both executables from source code. It is perfectly well possible to take as the first file any executable from any source, and as the second file produce a second executable as malware. Then a byte block to be appended to both files can be found such that the resulting files have the same MD5 hash value. If an attacker can then get the first file to be signed, e.g. by the original software vendor, this signature will also be valid for the attacker-constructed malware.  It can be objected that at a bit-level inspection of the executable(s) it will become apparent that there is a strange non-functional random looking block of bytes at the end of the executable. This may be true for specialists knowing what to expect in executables, at least for us it's a complete mystery what should and should not be expected inside executables. Moreover, it could very well be possible to hide the colliding blocks not at the end, but hidden somewhere else in a less conspicuous place of the binary executable files.  Note that with the technique of constructing multi-collisions as described on our Nostradamus website, it is very well feasible to produce as many different (executable) files as one wants, all with the same MD5 hash.  One idea to thwart our attacks is to provide software with self-checking components, e.g. the software checks the integrity of its own executable as the first step of the execution. This might be a countermeasure against our attack. Nevertheless we think that the proper way to go is to avoid relying on broken crypto such as MD5 altogether.  Given the recent insights into the weaknesses of MD5, the bottomline of our work is:  | ***MD5 should no longer be used as a hash function for software integrity or code signing purposes***. | | --- |  By now, everyone should be aware of this. If you are still using MD5, it would be good to carefully analyse the risks that result from its continued usage.  Note that also the collision resistance of SHA-1 does not live up to its design criteria anymore, though attacking SHA-1 is still much more difficult than attacking MD5. See the [IAIK Krypto collision website](http://www.iaik.tugraz.at/research/krypto/collision/index.php) for the present state of affairs. |
| --- |  | --- |
| **Hasn't this been done before?** |  | In December 2004 [Dan Kaminsky](http://www.doxpara.com/research/md5/md5_someday.pdf) and [Ondrej Mikle](http://cryptography.hyperlink.cz/2004/collisions.htm), and later [Peter Selinger](http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/), published similar attacks, based on the Wang-type collisions that require two binary files that differ only in the colliding blocks. To create such files from two executables with different behaviour that yet collide under MD5, each of the two files has to contain both executables in full, somehow using the collision to switch on the one and hide the other.  Our colliding files are based on chosen-prefix collisions. This means that we only have to append a few thousand carefully chosen bytes to each file to reach an MD5 collision. Each file by itself contains only one of the two executables. This is less suspicious. |
| --- |  | --- |
| **Sony PlayStation 3** |  | As mentioned on the [Nostradamus attack](../Nostradamus.html) website, we make our chosen-prefix collisions using a Sony Playstation 3. The collision built inside the above executables took us less than 2 days to make. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-02 12:52:15 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2004-2761](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-2761) to the following vulnerability:  The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm is not collision resistant, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to conduct spoofing attacks, as demonstrated by attacks on the use of MD5 in the signature algorithm of an X.509 certificate.  References: <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/836068> <http://eprint.iacr.org/2004/199> <http://eprint.iacr.org/2005/067> <http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/> <http://www.phreedom.org/research/rogue-ca/> <http://blog.mozilla.com/security/2008/12/30/md5-weaknesses-could-lead-to-certificate-forgery/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-02 13:30:44 UTC  ``` As noted in the Knowledgebase article, Red Hat Certificate System is configured to use SHA-1 hash algorithm by default:  <https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-15379>  It was discovered, however, that Red Hat / Dogtag Certificate System used MD5 algorithm for SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol) protocol communication and provided no way to disable the use of MD5.  There are additional implementation properties that make an MD5 chosen-prefix collision attack more feasible against Certificate System's SCEP component:  - Main Certificate Authority's key pair used to issue certificates is used to secure SCEP communication too (to decrypt requests and sign responses).  - All SCEP responses are signed by CA, including negative / failure responses.  An attacker does not need to have a valid enrollment one-time PIN to get signed reply from the Certificate System.  - Certificate System does not limit the size of the the senderNonce provided in the SCEP request and which is echoed back in the SCEP reply.  It also did not provide its own senderNonce in SCEP reply packets.  Colliding prefix can be used as part of the sender nonce that is echoed back by the CA unchanged.  This may allow attacker to create certificate or CRL signed using CA's key and using MD5 has algorithms.  Following changes were done in the Certificate System to address this problem:  - Support for SHA hash function family (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512) was added to Red Hat Certificate System 7.3.  These hash functions were previously supported in version 8.  SHA-1 hash function is now used by default.  - CS.cfg configuration file can now specify default and allowed algorithms to be used by the SCEP component, e.g.:     ca.scep.hashAlgorithm=SHA1     ca.scep.allowedHashAlgorithms=SHA1,SHA256,SHA512 Similar options - ca.scep.encryptionAlgorithm and ca.scep.allowedEncryptionAlgorithms - can be used to configure encryption algorithm preferences.  Allowed algorithms list can be used to avoid downgrade to the use of weaker algorithms in cases where network devices tries to use DES/MD5 first for compatibility with older SCEP specifications.  The use of SHA hash algorithm avoids the MD5 collision problem.  Following additional changes aim to make the attack less feasible in configuration where the use of MD5 can not be disabled.  - It is possible to limit the size of the nonce copied from SCEP requests to SCEP responses using ca.scep.nonceSizeLimit option.  Default CS.cfg file sets the limit to 16 bytes.  - SCEP replies now include server-generated nonce.  - Separate key pair can be used for SCEP communication.  It can be specified in the CS.cfg configuration using ca.scep.nickname option.  - SCEP component is disabled by default.  It can be enabled by adding ca.scep.enable=true to the CS.cfg configuration file.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2010-11-02 23:14:51 UTC  ``` Is the intent of this bug to phase out MD5 usage in programs (i.e. replacing it with SHA256?) in Red Hat products?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-03 10:07:56 UTC  ``` Not a phase out all MD5, but phase out where needed.  Results of the efforts that were done in Fedora to add support for stronger hashes are to be seen in future Red Hat products too, of course.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-08 20:07:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Certificate System 7.3  Via RHSA-2010:0837 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0837.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-08 20:12:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Certificate System 8  Via RHSA-2010:0838 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0838.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-09 13:58:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c1))  > Following changes were done in the Certificate System to address this > problem: >  > - Support for SHA hash function family (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512) was added > to Red Hat Certificate System 7.3.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated pki-ca, pki-util, and pki-common packages that fix three security
issues and add several enhancements are now available for Red Hat
Certificate System 8.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Certificate System is an enterprise software system designed to
manage enterprise public key infrastructure (PKI) deployments. Simple
Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) is a PKI communication protocol
used to automatically enroll certificates for network devices.

The certificate authority allowed unauthenticated users to request the
one-time PIN in an SCEP request to be decrypted. An attacker able to sniff
an SCEP request from a network device could request the certificate
authority to decrypt the request, allowing them to obtain the one-time
PIN. With this update, the certificate authority only handles decryption
requests from authenticated registration authorities. (CVE-2010-3868)

The certificate authority allowed the one-time PIN used in SCEP requests
to be re-used. An attacker possessing a valid SCEP enrollment one-time PIN
could use it to generate an unlimited number of certificates.
(CVE-2010-3869)

The certificate authority used the MD5 hash algorithm to sign all SCEP
protocol responses. As MD5 is not collision resistant, an attacker could
use this flaw to perform an MD5 chosen-prefix collision attack to generate
attack-chosen output signed using the certificate authority's key.
(CVE-2004-2761)

This update also adds the following enhancements:

* New configuration options for the SCEP server can define the default and

allowed encryption and hash algorithms. These options allow disabling uses
of the weaker algorithms not required by network devices and prevent
possible downgrade attacks. These can be configured by adding the following
options to the certificate authority's CS.cfg configuration file:

ca.scep.encryptionAlgorithm=DES3
 ca.scep.allowedEncryptionAlgorithms=DES3
 ca.scep.hashAlgorithm=SHA1
 ca.scep.allowedHashAlgorithms=SHA1,SHA256,SHA512

* With this update, the certificate authority's SCEP server is disabled by

default. The SCEP server can be enabled by adding the 'ca.scep.enable=true'
option to the certificate authority's CS.cfg configuration file.

* A separate key pair can now be configured for use in SCEP communication.

Previously, the main certificate authority's key pair was used for SCEP
communication too. A designated SCEP key pair can be referenced by adding
a new option, ca.scep.nickname=[scep certificate nickname], to the
certificate authority's CS.cfg configuration file.

* The certificate authority now allows the size of nonces used in SCEP

requests to be restricted by adding a new option, ca.scep.nonceSizeLimit=
[number of bytes], to the certificate authority's CS.cfg configuration
file. The limit is set to 16 bytes in the default CS.cfg configuration
file.

All users of Red Hat Certificate System 8 should upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues and add these enhancements.

# MD5 Weaknesses Could Lead to Certificate Forgery

Johnathan Nightingale
December 30, 2008

[19 responses](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2008/12/30/md5-weaknesses-could-lead-to-certificate-forgery/#comments)

**Issue**

Researchers have recently found [weaknesses in the MD5 hash algorithm](http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/), relied on by some SSL certificates. Using these weaknesses, an attacker could obtain fraudulent SSL certificates for websites they don’t legitimately control.

**Impact to users**

If a user visits an SSL site presenting a fraudulent certificate, there will be no obvious sign of a problem and the connection will appear to be secure. This could result in the user disclosing personal information to the site, believing it to be legitimate. We advise users to exercise caution when interacting with sites that require sensitive information, particularly when using public internet connections.

**Status**

This is not an attack on a Mozilla product, but we are nevertheless working with affected certificate authorities to ensure that their issuing processes are updated to prevent this threat. Mozilla is not aware of any instances of this attack occurring in the wild.

Microsoft has [released their own advisory](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/961509.mspx) as well.

   > Is it possible from the Firefox UI to tell if the certificate for the site I’m visiting is signed using only an MD5 hash, or if there is a certificate in the chain of trust that is signed using only MD5?
   >
   > Please correct me if I’m wrong, but it seems to me that if all the certificates in the chain use SHA-1 instead of (or in addition to) MD5, it would be possible to prove that an SSL connection is not being attacked in this way. Instructions on how to check this could be helpful for those users who choose to be extra vigilant.

    > How difficult would it be for someone to code an add-in to detect an MD5 certificate in use, implemented as a flag or (possibly a canary if that is easier coding)? I am not a Mozilla development-type, and I tried messing about with sqlite3.exe from the command line to try to produce a local list of MD5 certificates from the cert8.db database with no success. I would very much like to have a way to alert my users of a potentially forged SSL site in the event that this vulnerability becomes prevalent in the wild before it is addressed effectively.

    > This is not a recently discovered weakness in MD5: it was discovered in 2001-2005 and much has been published about it since then. These same researchers already published SSL (X.509) certificates with distinct names on them, but identical MD5 hashes in 2006 – <http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/TargetCollidingCertificates/>. That publication also made the international press at the time.
    >
    > That Mozilla’s products still accept MD5 hashes for secure signing purposes is a bug that can only be explained by ignorance or apathy. This is one of those moments where you say “sorry” and not try to redirect responsibility to others.
    >
    > There is a clear problem with Mozilla products: the software should be fixed and stop accepting any SSL certificate that uses MD5 checksums altogether (anywhere in the validation chain). After fixing that, you should think hard about out why you didn’t do this before.

    > Mozilla should have the ability to reject MD5-signed certs or at least alert the user. If there’s already such a control, where is it?

    > Can nothing more be done? I’d think that we’d be moving towards rejecting any cert chain with an MD5-based cert in it. I know we don’t want to break 30% of the web \_now\_, but it seems very fragile to leave all users everywhere vulnerable to MITM attacks so long as some CA somewhere has been issuing MD5-based certs.

    > Firefox can patch this vulnerability very quickly and very easily (show the world how quickly a Firefox can mitigate the issue!) using the existing SSL verification mechanisms for example: (xxx website uses an insecure security certificate. The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate uses the insecure MD5 algorithm. Error code: sec\_error\_insecure\_MD5\_issuer\_certificate))
    >
    > Users can still add an exception to the Rule if needed but it would Mitigate the issue because the user would still be warned…It would also put more pressure on affected websites still using MD5 certificates to update them immediately and further mitigate any attack scenarios…
    >
    > The amount of websites using MD5 based certificates are small and if they see their certificate not working with Firefox or showing the “Secure Connection Failed” Page they will request a new certificate immediately…
    >
    > The longer Browsers accept MD5 based certificates the longer it will take to force website operators to update as some people just wouldn’t care unless their certificate no longer works…

    > How about steps to check whether a cert in the chain uses MD5? An advisory concerning Moz. Products like firefox would be nice! Firefox extension that warns when an https connection relying on a MD5 hashed cert is established?

    > This security issue shows that the security model of Firefox relying exclusively on third party authentication (i.e. the recent demise of self-signed certificates in Firefox 3) is fundamentally broken.
    >
    > One should not be more confident in a Verisign certificate than in a self-signed one. What is really meaningful is when something “strange” happens in the background, e.g. when a website changes its certificate (self-signed or not).

## Security

### Red Hat Product Security

Red Hat believes that everyone, everywhere, is entitled to quality information needed to mitigate security and privacy risks, as well as the access to do so. We strive to protect communities of customers, contributors, and partners from digital security threats. We believe open source principles are the best way to achieve this.

![Illustration of secure applications and technology within the cloud](/rhdc/managed-files/RH_BRAND_007283_01_MECH_Security_FullColor_Grey_0.svg)

## Red Hat's security principles

Our open source security principles are baked into our products, services, and support

#### Defense in depth

Failure or compromise of a single layer or component of a system should not compromise the system as a whole.

#### Separation of duty

No one person, entity, or system identity should have full control or access to all elements of a policy, process, or system.

#### Secure by design

Security is not an add-on, afterthought, or checklist.

#### Secure by default

The default system configuration should have all reasonable security controls enabled and all services and features not needed for basic operation disabled.

#### Least privilege

Individuals, system identities, roles, entities, or execution contexts, be they human or automation, should be scoped to include only the access to resources required to complete the assigned and expected task or business duties.

#### Transparency

The open source principle of transparency should also apply to security issues and data, including designs, algorithms, and source code, all of which should be freely available when reasonable.

#### Understand the threat

Effective defense of a system must consider the nature of the actual threat or risk that is being mitigated or defended against so the appropriate responses are utilized.

## What we do:

* [Incident response](https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerability-management)

ISP users are recommended to obtain available mitigating controls by accessing their InCenter account at this location:

<http://incenter.medical.philips.com>

Users with questions regarding their specific ISP installations are advised by Philips to contact their local Philips service support team or their regional service support.

Philips’ contact information is available at the following location:

<https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/solutions/customer-service-solutions>

Please see the Philips product security website for the latest security information for Philips products:

<https://www.philips.com/productsecurity>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate all medical devices and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
