- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm is not collision resistant.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: MD5's lack of collision resistance allows for spoofing attacks. In the context of X.509 certificates, an attacker could exploit this to create rogue Certification Authority (CA) certificates trusted by common web browsers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack allows an attacker to impersonate any website on the Internet, including banking and e-commerce sites secured using the HTTPS protocol. This can be used for undetectable phishing attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack involves creating an MD5 collision between a legitimate website certificate and a rogue CA certificate. The attacker obtains a valid signature from a commercial CA for the legitimate certificate, and then copies that signature into their rogue CA certificate.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to request a legitimate website certificate from a CA that uses MD5. They need to be able to predict the validity period and serial numbers of the certificates issued by the CA. The attacker also requires significant computational resources to generate the MD5 collision.
