{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "XScreenSaver did not always ensure that it correctly had the keyboard focus when the screensaver was active.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A race condition where the keyboard focus could be stolen by another application (e.g. rdesktop), leading to password disclosure.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A user's password could end up being leaked to the program that had the keyboard focus.",
  "Attack vectors": "Exploitation of the race condition by a malicious or vulnerable application stealing keyboard focus.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to have an application running that could steal focus from the screensaver (e.g. a remote desktop program). The attacker would also need the user to be entering their password while the malicious application has focus"
