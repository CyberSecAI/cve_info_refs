An anonymous reader writes *"Recently [Slashdot reported that the Netgear router has as WLAN backdoor](//hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/06/05/1250244&tid=193). According to this report by the news service of the German publisher Heise Netgear "fixed" the problem with a firmware update. And what is the fix? According to Heise, they didn't remove the backdoor at all. Instead they just [changed the login information](http://www.heise.de/security/news/meldung/48005)! They replaced the old user name 'super' with 'superman', and changed the old password to '21241036'. "*

    Well, that might be good enough, if they could choose the login information. But now that they published it....

    First rule of passwords is that you don't talk about your passwords....

        The first rule of passwords is that you **do not** talk about your passwords.
        The second rule of passwords is that you **do not** talk about your passwords.
        The third rule is if someone uses "password" or nothing, there is no password.
        The fourth rule is only one person to a password.
        The fifth rule is one password at a time.
        The sixth rule is no sheets, no stickies.
        The seventh rule is password will be expired when they have to

        and the final rule of passwords is, if it's your first logon, you have to set one.

    Why are companies allowed to get away with this crap just because we pay them for their shoddy wares?

    Any open source coder would be summarily flogged for such a transgression. Why on EARTH is this not *literally* considered a criminal offense for a company to do?

      >Why are companies allowed to get away with this crap just because we pay them for their shoddy wares?

      The answer lies within the question: Because we pay them.

      If someone paid you to paint a building and didn't care whether you stripped off the old paint first, I guarantee you you would just slap a coat over the old paint.

      >And I for one used to hold Netgear in reasonably high regard, too.

      Your mistake, then.

      >Never again.

      You should not say never if you want to reach them. This just makes the company execs think that since they can never reach you as a customer again, they won't make the effort. What you should say instead is: "I will purchase products from other companies since theirs do not address my needs at this time."

      This is reasonable to them, and they won't discount you as a hot-head but rather may take your advice.

      Just my .016 euro

        Don't blame this on consumers. We don't have real choice until we have the relevant information. Things might be quite different with a bit of truth in advertising, like a sticker on the box which reads "Router WG602 - Now With Even More Backdoors!"

        The question of "why are companies allowed to get away with this crap" is a good one. They should either be forced to tell people what they're buying, or be accountable for the consequences of deception.

            I do.

            In fact I drove all possible candidates for several days before I bought what I have now. It is quite easy. Every time you go on a holiday rent one of the candidates for "next thing to buy". You get to see it in all of its "glory" - lowest spec, run down by tourists and badly maintained. If it is still OK you go and buy it. You may suffer some minor discomfort compared to renting "the old familiar", but you save a lot of money :-)

            I also do the same stuff with computer equipment. Buy, test drive if it is shit - return. It is quite easy to do it in EU due to distance selling regulations. You are entitled to a free return no questions asked of anything you have bought over phone or Internet within 1 week after purchase. This limits you to internt purchases, but once you add this along with observations of company kit you are reasonably well positioned to get the right stuff...

              I did the same thing. Was going to buy a specific car, and my wife and I loved it during the test drive -- so we rented one for a week's road trip. By the end of the first day, we HATED it, and couldn't wait to return it.

              We then rented the car we ultimately bought, and it's been so good to us, she's still got the first one, I bought a second one, and I have since traded it in for a high-performance version of the same. Whee!

              And no, I'm not going to tell you the cars, but I'll give you a hint: the one we hated rhymes with bored locus, and the one we love (sort of) rhymes with grease-on ben-tra. Hard to rhyme with car names that are invented words. Heh.

                In my day, the grease-on ben-tra ran like grease on a pan - that had been burned in place and left there for weeks. Our grease-on ben-tra had a zero to sixty time of sixty seconds, and couldn't steer without rattling like the bones of Buddy Holly. Fuel efficiency? That thing drank like an ex army sergent. And it broke down more often than Tammy Fae. Often times we would be driving it to the shop, and it would break down again on the way. You'd hook it up to the tow truck because of a broken front wheel and the rear axle would crack. Load it on the back, and the bumper would fall off. That thing wasn't a deathtrap: deathtraps have moving parts.

                Hope you like it. Have fun with your car!

          Your last line says it all - they should be held accountable. If it's advertised as being secure, and a backdoor is found, they should have to buy back every single unit or replace every single unit with a working one.

          If anyone has been damaged by the availability of the back door they should be held liable even if they claim you waive that right in their license agreement (their license agreement does not state there may be the possibility of back doors, no?)

          If you claim something is secure, but that you can't prevent all future attacks so you can't be liable, that's one thing, but when the liability is clearly your fault, it's another.

          Be realistic, if the box DID have a sticker saying "Router WG602 - Now With Even More Backdoors!" most Joe-BestBuy-Consumers would flip it over and look for little doors on the back of it.

      My experience with Netgear products has led me to believe their quality has diminished dramatically.

      IANAL, but I seem to recall a lawyer I know telling me that with product liability, a company is liable if due diligence is not performed to fix an issue when a known problem exists. Of course, the trick becomes can you call changing a username and password due diligence? I feel certain every computer expert in the world would say no.

        The interesting thing about liability is that if they have some control over your routers, then you can hold them more liable than if they had no control. Further, now that everyone knows they can 'dial in' then hopefully customers will pester them to fix their products remotely instead of spending hours on the phone. In the end a backdoor is \*much\* more work than a product without one.

        Silly programmer, backdoors are for script kiddies.

                They do (or should) involve buying back a defective product as buying that product (under false pretenses) is financially harmful to the company that bought them.

                I don't see how forcing a company to take a defective product back and returning the purchasers money is "wildy disproportionate." It's seems exactly proportionate, no more, no less.

                If I sold computers that didn't work as advertised, and the consumer was out $200 for it, then giving them a coupon for $5 off their next purchase is hardly compensatory. Compensatory... I need to compensate them. They spent $200 for a product that did not work as advertised...

    Well, it IS an improvement. The increase from 5 characters for the login to 8 now makes it SO much harder to crack. What was the old password? Someone do the math and figure out the number of new permutations they've added. Ha. I bet this is how the guy who did it justified the whole thing.

    "What da ya mean? It's MUCH more secure than it was before."

  I don't think there's anything amusing about this at all. I think the owners of these units should file a class action lawsuit, though i'm not even sure that's possible due to the EULA. If the EULA does get in the way then
  I think it's time the government steped in to protect the consumer and started making companies liable for acts as stupid as this. This just isn't the way a responsible company behaves.

        No, there aren't many responsible companies at all, and your post illustrates why. They have higher prices, less effective marketing (because they don't lie like their irresponsible competition), don't get ahead because they don't do unethical backroom deals, etc., so in the end they just go belly-up, and all the irresponsible companies get bigger.

    EULAs cannot prevent lawsuits. The EULA becomes part of the *evidence* of the suit and the suit itself determines to what degree, if any, its terms effect a possible ruling.

    In fact, this is precisely how the legality of a EULA is tested. A EULA is a just a contract. Contracts don't prevent lawsuits, they become the object of them.

    I'd imagine it wouldn't work. They've probably checksummed the file, and if you change any of the content you'd have to rechecksum it, if you even knew what kind of checksum (if any) they'd used.

    Nice idea though.

      I have an earlier Netgear product (RT314). It's actually a rebranded Zytel product, so this trick may not work on other models.

      However, it was possible to edit the firmware in a binary editor. There was a checksum in the firmware, but you could fix it. You needed to connect a serial cable to the management port. When you made a change and uploaded the new firmware to the router and rebooted, the router would helpfully tell you what the old checksum was and what it expected the new checksum to be. You could then just search for the old checksum string and replace it with the new one the router calculated for you.

      Pretty easy to do. And allowed you to run some of the newer Zytel firmware on the Netgear boxes.

    I concur, their reputation is badly damaged now. Fortunately, I don't have this WAP in my house, nor am I now likely to use their gear in the future. I can't trust them and that lack of trust will be multiplied as I tell the people that come to me for advice not to use NetGear equipment.

    From other postings, it appears that until this, technically they appear to produce good equipment. However, undocumented "features" ;) like this are inexcusable, all the more so when the end user cannot fix it themselves, even if they want to! I'll agree that most people don't read slashdot and so might not know (nor care in many cases), but for those of us that do, it would be nice if we could fix it. If the firmware made it something that the end user could correct, and end users then did not, that would be one thing. But, to use the car scenario again, to unweld the hood, make a change and then weld it shut again is a poor decision.

    Those of us that regularly read Slashdot are probably the alpha geeks of our groups. The person that many people come to for informal IT support at home and at work. I am frequently asked my opinion about gear and for recommendations on what gear to buy. These people then tell their friends what they use, why they use it and how satisfied they are. This "viral" type of advertising is the kind that you can't buy when it's good and can't kill when it's not. I will not recommend products by a company that, when caught with it's hand in the cookie jar, merely switches hands. It was bad enough to get caught doing this but to change the password rather than remove the exploit reveals a mindset that I will keep in mind during future work in this field.

    Can they recover from this? I would imagine that there are ways to do so aside from the usual corporate tactic of relying on consumer apathy and time. I'll be curious to see if they bother and what they do if they do bother to try.

  Now this is very sad. How can any semi-reputable company call changing the admin username and password for a major security hole a fix? Especially since they should have realized this new username/password would hit the net faster than Homer at an all you can eat buffet.

  Since these things have built in firewalls, wouldnt the fix just include a user-invisible firewall rule preventing access to the router on whatever the admin port is (80, 8080, etc..)? Seems like a fairly simple fix to me.

  Thanks Netgear! You've just assured that I'll never buy one of your products!

  I am amused. When I say the headline I just about died laughing. The sad part is that most people that have a Netgear router aren't going to update the firmware, and they probably don't even care or understand the issues involved. Further, what about all those units that are on the shelf somewhere? The problem is that Netgear has admitted now that they are not interested in security and they are not offering a secured unit. I was amused when I installed one for a friend -- she had bought the unit. No user name, just a password. I am thinking that IEEE or ANSI or whoever should adopt a standard for baseline security for routers. That way even an idiot that wants to have an open WIFI device won't have to worry about some Wardriver taking over his device. Well, all I can say is that I am happy that I was not the executive that made the Superman call.

  Flawed Routers Flood University of Wisconsin Internet Time Server

  [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~plonka/netgear-sntp/](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~plonka/netgear-sntp/ "wisc.edu") [wisc.edu]

  Abstract:

  "In May 2003, the University of Wisconsin - Madison found that it was the recipient of a continuous large scale flood of inbound Internet traffic destined for one of the campus' public Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers. The flood traffic rate was hundreds-of-thousands of packets-per-second, and hundreds of megabits-per-second.

  Subsequently, we have determined the sources of this flooding to be literally hundreds of thousands of real Internet hosts throughout the world. However, rather than having originated as a malicious distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the root cause is actually a serious flaw in the design of hundreds of thousands of one vendor's low-cost Internet products targeted for residential use. The unexpected behavior of these products presents a significant operational problem for UW-Madison for years to come.

  This document includes the initial public disclosure of details of these products' serious design flaw. Furthermore, it discusses our ongoing, multifaceted approach toward the solution which involves the University, the products' manufacturer, the relevant Internet standards (RFCs), and the public Internet service and user communities."

  Now, I'm not going to even start discussing whether the product \*should\* have a backdoor. There are many reasons for including them, and many obvious reasons to not.

  What I want to know is, why bother with user names and passwords in the backdoor? An SSH tunnel using only public key authentication would pretty much solve the problem of someone examining the firmware for the login information. You could also include multiple keys and provide a public key revokation server that the units automatically update from, as well as a general key update server that the units will grab new keys from using a callback mechanism (to guarantee that the key update servers have a valid private key for connecting to the unit).

  That's crap. There may be a multitude of reasons why they couldn't remove the backdoor (no access to source code, the guy who wrote it was on holiday, whatever...) but they could have at least changed the password with a hex editor to something that was difficult to type from a keyboard, low-ascii values for example.

  Doesn't having the username and password in the clear mean that anybody who knows how to use a Hex editor can make their own patch? Just find those two strings and change them to something else, or better some sequence of bits that don't map to text.

  Is there a checksum or CRC check in the firmware loader on the router that keeps you from being able to do that?

    *Is there a checksum or CRC check in the firmware loader on the router that keeps you from being able to do that?*

    Almost certainly. Vendors normally checksum firmware to avoid the possibility of flashing the hardware with corrupt firmware data. However, given Netgear's track record, you could probably flash it with a JPEG file and it'd accept it OK.

    This sort of thing makes me wonder what backdoors are in other firmware and software that have not yet been discovered. I'm glad that there are people like SecurityFocus looking out for these exploits. Endless numbers of ADSL modems, routers and other equipment seem to have backdoors in them.

  For immediate release. June 8, 2004.
  Netgear (NASDAQ: BLAH) today announced immediate release of new technology designed to eliminate enterprise security threats by thwarting hackers. By leveraging innovative technologies, content providers streamline compelling enterprise solutions.

  The technology, which allows anyone to access enterprise networks when they enter 'superman' for the username and and '21241036' for the password, frees enterprises from worrying about security issues and allows IT managers to focus on implementing talking paperclips on enterprise desktops. "We are excited about the new technology," commented Steve Hjarkblonka in an interview. "For the first time since the invention of computers, the threat of security intrusions has been completely eliminated. Enterprises can now enjoy 100% unbreakable security."

  Geoff Nikreny, chief security officer with Endostar Inc, calls the secure-by-default approach, in which once-vulnerable features are patched, a "mistake" that will lead to deployment confusion. But he doesn't know what he's talking about anyway. So for 100% unbreakable security, buy Netgear.

  Offer good while supplies last.

  Ah, yes, the lovely irony of a security company outsourcing their own product's security.

  Nothing like trusting your future to some shady fly-by-night low-bidder who's not an employee. Whoever at Netgear argued this process saves money, I almost pity you. Almost.

  Although in this case, you can't argue that specs called FOR a backdoor... but maybe there were no specs at all.

  I don't blame them for this "quick fix".. as a longtime Software QA engineer I can tell you it takes more than 1 day to test something, unless you're willing to accept the risk that the fix could be worse. I'm willing to bet the OEM developer is probably just a one or two man shop, has no QA and might not even have source code control.

  off-topic:
  I run [m0n0wall](http://www.m0n0.ch/wall/ "m0n0.ch") [m0n0.ch], a BSD distribution just for firewalls & routers. It doesn't need a hard drive so it's quiet.

  I even yanked the CPU fan off the AMD K6/450 it is running on. CAUTION: passive cooling a CPU risks burning out the processor. To prevent this I fitted a stock AMD CPU sink from an Athlon 1800, and made a small duct for the power supply to draw air over the CPU (this was an OLD old ATX case with the PS directly above the CPU so it was easy).

  Works great!

  Too bad you can't upload monowall into consumer routers. I think this is the next step. Some vendor will start making it very easy to do such a thing (discoveries like the Linksys WRT54G hacking do not count).

  The firmware for this box (or at least some of it) is offered for download on Netgear's site. I'm looking through the source, but I haven't seen anything relevant yet.

  Has anyone seen where the backdoor is coded into the system? (Hint: if it's NOT in the source anywhere, Netgear is violating GPL here).

  It's just that, according to the site, there's no fix yet:

   [http://kbserver.netgear.com/kb\_web\_files/n101383.a sp](http://kbserver.netgear.com/kb_web_files/n101383.asp "netgear.com") [netgear.com]

  Now, there is a firmware from the 4th:

   [http://kbserver.netgear.com/support\_details.asp?dn ldID=735](http://kbserver.netgear.com/support_details.asp?dnldID=735 "netgear.com") [netgear.com]

  that claims to fix the problem, but I'm tempted to suggest what's happened is they've changed the username and password while they test a full fix. After all, changing data is generally less likely to break stuff than changing code...

  Man this sucks. I've got an FVS318. While, thankfully it's not the router that is the cause of this particular ruckus, it's a Netgear product.

  I like it. It's a very solid, reliable firewall/router. I've had it for a number of years now, and Netgear to this day continues to put out new firmware updates that not only fix bugs, but implement new features. It works well, and I always liked it better than my friend's Linksys.

  But this whole crisis makes me really really leary... How do I know there isn't a backdoor in my firewall/router as well? The fact is, now I don't.

  Getting a Linksys that can run a custom Linux distribution becomes more appealing every single day. This may be what finally pushes me over the edge.

  I recently bought several 24 port switches off of ebay. There was no way to reset the password, but calling up tech support, and providing a small amount of proof that I did in fact buy these switches, they provided me with the backdoor username/password.

  It's documented on their website that they do have a backdoor password, and what you need to do to get it. For me, it took a single email (ebay end of auction), and a 5 minute phone call to get the backdoor.

  This would be fine, if the backdoor only worked on the serial console, but nope.. Works fine with the web interface too :(

  Someday, somebody from Netgear is going to have to explain that to a judge and jury. And it's not going to go over well. Once might be considered ordinary negligence. But the second time moves it into the "gross negligence" category: "an act or omission in reckless disregard of the consequences affecting the life or property of another."

  I would think under current laws that installing an undisclosed backdoor onto someone elses property would be akin to using a trojan to allow access to anothers system. Just becaujse they sell the system does not give them the right to access to it after it is sold. I can see no beneficial reason for this as most consumer routers have a hardware reset that reloads the factory defaults.

  If you owned one of these routers, could you figure out where those strings are then just type in random letters of gobbleygook that are the same lengths, and use it on your own router (not distribute it, because then you'd be giving the pass away :))?

  Maybe somebody could make a program where:

  1. User opens program
  2. User points program to firmware file
  3. Program opens firmware file and replaces the hardcoded passwords with gobbleygook that is different each time the program is run
  4. Program writes new firmware to disk
  5. User reflashes router with firmware patched by programThis seems like a good potential short-term solution to me...

    Netgear has promptly reacted to the reports of a backdoor in the WLAN-Access-Point WG602 Version 1 with a Firmware-Update, however, the backdoor is still present, but with a new user name and password. They were a little creative with the name and extended the original character string "super" to "superman." With the password, Netgear has obviously taken the message of security seriously and changed the password to "21241036." However, to whom this telephone number points, Netgear did not comment. There, they knew nothing and initially only wanted to make themselves aware of the (details of the) problem.

    Again, there is not a real updated firmware design yet. The question arises whether users are still determined--after the second patch--to get new software. In the lawyer's opinions, this problem could be reason enough to take back the device to the retailer and receive a refund of the purchase price. For now, the retailer can try to fix the shortcoming, however, the chances of that are not very good.

    Unfortunately Heise (publisher of c't and iX) is the probably most clueful German publishing house when it comes to technology.

    Those Netgear bozos really seem to be dumber then my cigar cutter.

    The other explanation is that the equipment has such a fundamental design flaw that it can't be fixed at all. But then they act damn unresponsible.

Second of all if you would bother to read the responses in the article you linked to, you would see that some people have already proved that its not a hoax with regards to the Linksys product.

      Maybe you typed wrong. ;-) I can confirm without any doubt that both versions 1.5.67 and 1.7.14 from the netgear site has these backdoors installed.

      As a matter of fact it was me who found the 1.7.14 username and password and posted it to securityfocus after updating my firmware from 1.5.67(which I tested with the super username and password) to 1.7.14.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# NETGEAR Product Security

#####

NETGEAR’s mission is to unleash the full potential of connectivity with intelligent solutions that delight and protect. To achieve this mission, we strive to earn and maintain the trust of our customers by delivering products that are secure and that will protect the privacy and security of our customers’ data.

We appreciate having security concerns brought to our attention and are constantly monitoring our products to get in front of the latest threats. Being pro-active rather than re-active to emerging security issues is a fundamental belief at NETGEAR. NETGEAR strives to keep up-to-date on the latest security developments by working with both security researchers and companies. We appreciate the community's efforts in creating a more secure world.

To protect users, NETGEAR does not publicly announce security vulnerabilities until fixes are publicly available, nor are the exact details of such vulnerabilities released. Once fixes are available, NETGEAR will announce the vulnerabilities on this page.

##### Report Vulnerabilities

NETGEAR's Product Security Team investigates all reports of security vulnerabilities affecting NETGEAR products and services. If you are a security researcher and believe you have found a security vulnerability in a NETGEAR product or service, please submit your report through our bug bounty program hosted by Bugcrowd. Our process ensures that each submission is thoroughly reviewed and tracked. You will be able to monitor the status of your report and see the results of our investigation.

[Click Here](https://bugcrowd.com/netgear)

For researchers who do not wish to participate in the bounty program but still want to submit their vulnerability reports, please use the link provided below. Your submission will be processed with the same level of attention and you will be able to track the status and results of your report.
