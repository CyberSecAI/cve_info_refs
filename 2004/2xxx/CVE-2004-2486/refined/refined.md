Fix from MichaIng, the format changed in 2020.79\n- Dropbear now exits with exit status 0 on SIGINT/SIGTERM. This is a more\ngraceful behaviour for \"systemctl stop dropbear\".\nReported by Ninad Palsule\n- New IDENT\\_VERSION\\_PART config allows customising some of the SSH version\nstring. From Marius Dinu\n- Fix building SK\\_KEYS with just one of ECDSA or ED25519\nFrom Marius Dinu\n- Fix dbclient \"-m help\" and \"-c help\" without a hostname.\nPatch from Darren Tucker\n- Remove fprintf/gettimeofday from sigchld handler when running with\nverbose trace enabled.\n- Improved configure help output, from Mikel Olasagasti Uranga\n- Compile fix for GNU Hurd, from Guilhem Moulin\n- Support running test\\_aslr without venv, from Guilhem Moulin\n- Compilation fixes for older compilers, and better build tests\n- Update some test infrastructure versions of python packages,\ngithub actions, and github runner OSes\n2024.85 - 25 April 2024\nThis release fixes build regressions in 2024.84\n- Fix build failure when SHA1 is disabled, thanks to Peter Krefting\n- Fix build failure when DROPBEAR\\_CLI\\_PUBKEY\\_AUTH disabled, thanks to\nSergey Ponomarev\n- Update debian/ directory with changed paths\n2024.84 - 4 April 2024\nFeatures and Changes:\nNote >> for compatibility/configuration changes\n- >> Only use /etc/shadow when a user has :x: as the crypt in /etc/passwd.\nThis is the documented behaviour of passwd(5) so should be consistent with\nother programs. Thanks to Paulo Cabral for the report.\nNote that any users without x as the crypt will not be able\nto log in with /etc/shadow, in cases were the existing configuration\ndiffers.\n- Support -o StrictHostKeyChecking, patch from Sergey Ponomarev\n- Support -o BatchMode, from Sergey Ponomarev and Hans Harder\n- Support various other -o options compatible with OpenSSH, from\nSergey Ponomarev. Includes -o PasswordAuthentication\n- Add dbclient config file support, ~/.ssh/dropbear\\_config\nThanks to tjkolev\nDisabled by default, set #define DROPBEAR\\_USE\\_SSH\\_CONFIG 1\n- Add support for unix socket forwarding (destination) on\nthe server, thanks to WangYi for the implementation\n- Add option to bind to interface, from Diederik De Coninck\n- Ignore unsupported arguments in dropbearkey, allow running\nbinary as 'ssh-key'. From Sergey Ponomarev\n- Save a public key file on generation with dropbearkey.\n-C can be used for a comment, and choose a default key\ntype (ed25519 first preference).\nThanks to Sergey Ponomarev\n- Allow inetd to run in non-syslog modes. Thanks to Laurent Bercot\nfor the report\n- Allow user's own gid in PTY permissions, lets Dropbear work as non-root\neven if /dev/pts isn't mounted with gid=5\n- src/distrooptions.h can now be used as another config file.\nThis can be used by distributions for customisations (separate\nto the build directory's localoptions.h)\nFixes:\n- \"dbclient host >> output\" would previously overwrite \"output\", instead of\nappending. Thanks for the report from eSotoIoT\n- Add \"Strict KEX\" support. This mitigates a SSH protocol flaw which lets\na MITM attacker silently remove packets immediately after the\nfirst key exchange. At present the flaw does not seem to reduce Dropbear's\nsecurity (the only packet affected would be a server-sig-algs extension,\nwhich is used for compatibility not security).\nFor Dropbear, chacha20-poly1305 is the only affected cipher.\nBoth sides of the connection must support Strict KEX for it to be used.\nThe protocol flaw is tracked as CVE-2023-48795, details\nat https://terrapin-attack.com . Thanks to the researchers Fabian Bäumer,\nMarcus Brinkmann, and Jörg Schwenk. Thanks to OpenSSH for specifying\nstrict KEX mode.\n- Fix blocking while closing forwarded TCP sessions. Noticable\nwhen many connections are being forwarded. Reported and\ntested by GektorUA. Github #230\n- Don't offer RSA (then fail) if there is no RSA key. Regression in 2020.79\nGithub #219\n- Fix missing response to remote TCP requests when it is disabled.\nPatch from Justin Chen. Github #254\n- Fix building with DROPBEAR\\_RSA disabled\n- /proc/timer\\_list is no longer used for entropy, it was a bottleneck.\nThanks to Aleksei Plotnikov for the report.\n- Don't unconditionally enable DROPBEAR\\_DSS\n- Make banner reading failure non-fatal\n- Fix DROPBEAR\\_SVR\\_MULTIUSER. This appears to have been broken since when it\nwas added in 2019. If you're using this let me know (it might be removed\nif I don't hear otherwise). Thanks to davidatrsp\n- Fix Y2038 issues\nInfrastructure:\n- Move source files to src/ subdirectory. Thanks to tjkolev\n- Remove more files with \"make distclean\"\n- Add tests for disabled options\n2022.83 - 14 November 2022\nFeatures and Changes:\nNote >> for compatibility/configuration changes\n- >> Disable DROPBEAR\\_DSS by default\nIt is only 1024 bit and uses sha1, most distros disable it by default already.\n- Added DROPBEAR\\_RSA\\_SHA1 option to allow disabling sha1 rsa signatures.\n>> RSA with sha1 will be disabled in a future release (rsa keys will continue\nto work OK, with sha256 signatures used instead).\n- Add option for requiring both password and pubkey (-t)\nPatch from Jackkal\n- Add 'no-touch-required' and 'verify-required' options for sk keys\nPatch from Egor Duda\n- >> DROPBEAR\\_SK\\_KEYS config option now replaces separate DROPBEAR\\_SK\\_ECDSA\nand DROPBEAR\\_SK\\_ED25519 options.\n- Add 'permitopen' option for authorized\\_keys to restrict forwarded ports\nPatch from Tuomas Haikarainen\n- >> Added LTM\\_CFLAGS configure argument to set flags for building\nbundled libtommath. This also restores the previous arguments used\nin 2020.81 (-O3 -funroll-loops). That gives a big speedup for RSA\nkey generation, which regressed in 2022.82.\nThere is a tradeoff with code size, so -Os can be used if required.\nhttps://github.com/mkj/dropbear/issues/174\nReported by David Bernard\n- Add '-z' flag to disable setting QoS traffic class. This may be necessary\nto work with broken networks or network drivers, exposed after changes to use\nAF21 in 2022.82\nhttps://github.com/mkj/dropbear/issues/193\nReported by yuhongwei380, patch from Petr Štetiar\n- Allow overriding user shells with COMPAT\\_USER\\_SHELLS\nBased on a patch from Matt Robinson\n- Improve permission error message\nPatch from k-kurematsu\n- >> Remove HMAC\\_MD5 entirely\nRegression fixes from 2022.82:\n- Fix X11 build\n- Fix build warning\n- Fix compilation when disabling pubkey authentication\nPatch from MaxMougg\n- Fix MAX\\_UNAUTH\\_CLIENTS regression\nReported by ptpt52\n- Avoid using slower prime testing in bundled libtomcrypt when DSS is disabled\nhttps://github.com/mkj/dropbear/issues/174\nSuggested by Steffen Jaeckel\n- Fix Dropbear plugin support\nhttps://github.com/mkj/dropbear/issues/194\nReported by Struan Bartlett\nOther fixes:\n- Fix long standing incorrect compression size check. Dropbear\n(client or server) would erroneously exit with\n\"bad packet, oversized decompressed\"\nwhen receiving a compressed packet of exactly the maximum size.\n- Fix missing setsid() removed in 2020.79\nhttps://github.com/mkj/dropbear/issues/180\nReported and debugged by m5jt and David Bernard\n- Try keyboard-interactive auth before password, in dbclient.\nThis was unintentionally changed back in 2013\nhttps://github.com/mkj/dropbear/pull/190\nPatch from Michele Giacomoli\n- Drain the terminal when reading the fingerprint confirmation response\nhttps://github.com/mkj/dropbear/pull/191\nPatch from Michele Giacomoli\n- Fix utx wtmp variable typo. This has been wrong for a long time but\nonly recently became a problem when wtmp was detected.\nhttps://github.com/mkj/dropbear/pull/189\nPatch from Michele Giacomoli\n- Improve configure test for hardening options.\nFixes building on AIX\nhttps://github.com/mkj/dropbear/issues/158\n- Fix debian/dropbear.init newline\nFrom wulei-student\nInfrastructure:\n- Test off-by-default compile options\n- Set -Wundef to catch typos in #if statements\n2022.82 - 1 April 2022\nFeatures and Changes:\nNote >> for compatibility/configuration changes\n- Implemented OpenSSH format private key handling for dropbearconvert.\nKeys can be read in OpenSSH format or the old PEM format.\n>> Keys are now written in OpenSSH format rather than PEM.\nED25519 support is now correct. DSS keys are still PEM format.\n- Use SHA256 for key fingerprints\n- >> Reworked -v verbose printing, specifying multiple times will increase\nverbosity. -vvvv is equivalent to the old DEBUG\\_TRACE -v level, it\ncan be configured at compile time in localoptions.h (see default\\_options.h)\nLower -v options can be used to check connection progress or algorithm\nnegotiation.\nThanks to Hans Harder for the implementation\nlocaloptions.h DEBUG\\_TRACE should be set to 4 for the same result as the\nprevious DEBUG\\_TRACE 1.\n- Added server support for U2F/FIDO keys (ecdsa-sk and ed25519-sk) in\nauthorized\\_keys. no-touch-required option isn't allowed yet.\nThanks to Egor Duda for the implementation\n- autoconf output (configure script etc) is now committed to version control.\n>> It isn't necessary to run \"autoconf\" any more on a checkout.\n- sha1 will be omitted from the build if KEX/signing/MAC algorithms don't\nrequire it. Instead sha256 is used for random number generation.\nSee sysoptions.h to see which algorithms require which hashes.\n- Set SSH\\_PUBKEYINFO environment variable based on the authorized\\_keys\nentry used for auth. The first word of the comment after the key is used\n(must only have characters a-z A-Z 0-9 .,\\_\\-+@)\nPatch from Hans Harder, modified by Matt Johnston\n- Let dbclient multihop mode be used with '-J'.\nPatch from Hans Harder\n- Allow home-directory relative paths ~/path for various settings\nand command line options.\n\\*\\_PRIV\\_FILENAME DROPBEAR\\_PIDFILE SFTPSERVER\\_PATH MOTD\\_FILENAME\nThanks to Begley Brothers Inc\n>> The default DROPBEAR\\_DEFAULT\\_CLI\\_AUTHKEY has now changed, it now needs\na tilde prefix.\n- LANG environment variable is carried over from the Dropbear server process\nFrom Maxim Kochetkov\n- Add /usr/sbin and /sbin to $PATH when logging in as root.\nPatch from Raphaël Hertzog\nhttps://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=903403\n- Added client option \"-o DisableTrivialAuth\". It disallows a server immediately\ngiving successful authentication (without presenting any password/pubkey prompt).\nThis avoids a UI confusion issue where it may appear that the user is accepting\na SSH agent prompt from their local machine, but are actually accepting a prompt\nsent immediately by the remote server.\nCVE-2021-36369 though the description there is a bit confused. It only applies\nto Dropbear as a client.\nThanks to Manfred Kaiser from Austrian MilCERT\n- Add -q client option to hide remote banner, from Hans Harder\n- Add -e option to pass all server environment variables to child processes.\nThis should be used with caution.\nPatch from Roland Vollgraf (github #118)\n- >> Use DSCP for QoS traffic classes. Priority (tty) traffic is now set to\nAF21 \"interactive\". Previously TOS classes were used, they are not used by\nmodern traffic classifiers. Non-tty traffic is left at default priority.\n- >> Disable dh-group1 key exchange by default. It has been disabled server\nside by default since 2018.\n- >> Removed Twofish cipher\nFixes:\n- Fix flushing channel data when pty was allocated (github #85)\nData wasn't completely transmitted at channel close.\nReported and initial patch thanks to Yousong Zhou\n- Dropbear now re-executes itself rather than just forking for each connection\n(only on Linux). This allows ASLR to randomise address space for each\nconnection as a security mitigation. It should not have any visible impact\n- if there are any performance impacts in the wild please report it.\n- Check authorized\\_keys permissions as the user, fixes NFS squash root.\nPatch from Chris Dragan (github #107)\n- A missing home directory is now non-fatal, starting in / instead\n- Fixed IPv6 [address]:port parsing for dbclient -b\nReported by Fabio Molinari\n- Improve error logging so that they are logged on the server rather than being\nsent to the client over the connection\n- Max window size is increased to 10MB, more graceful fallback if it's invalid.\n- Fix correctness of Dropbear's handling of global requests.\nPatch from Dirkjan Bussink\n- Fix some small bugs found by fuzzers, null pointer dereference crash and leaks\n(post authentication)\n- $HOME variable is used before /etc/passwd when expanding paths such as\n~/.ssh/id\\_dropbear (for the client). Patch from Matt Robinson\n- C89 build fixes from Guillaume Picquet\nInfrastructure:\n- Improvements to fuzzers. Added post-auth fuzzer, and a mutator that can\nhandle the structure of SSH packet streams. Added cifuzz to run on commits\nand pull requests.\nThanks to OSS-Fuzz for the tools/clusters and reward funding.\n- Dropbear source tarballs generated by release.sh are now reproducible from a\nGit or Mercurial checkout, they will be identical on any system. Tested\non ubuntu and macos.\n- Added some integration testing using pytest. Currently this has tests\nfor various channel handling edge cases, ASLR fork randomisation,\ndropbearconvert, and SSH\\_PUBKEYINFO\n- Set up github actions. This runs the pytest suite and other checks.\n- build matrix includes c89, dropbearmulti, bundled libtom, macos, DEBUG\\_TRACE\n- test for configure script regeneration\n- build a tarball for external reproducibility\n2020.81 - 29 October 2020\n- Fix regression in 2020.79 which prevented connecting with some SSH\nimplementations. Increase MAX\\_PROPOSED\\_ALGO to 50, and print a log\nmessage if the limit is hit. This fixes interoperability with sshj\nlibrary (used by PyCharm), and GoAnywhere.\nReported by Pirmin Walthert and Piotr Jurkiewicz\n- Fix building with non-GCC compilers, reported by Kazuo Kuroi\n- Fix potential long delay in dbclient, found by OSS Fuzz\n- Fix null pointer dereference crash, found by OSS Fuzz\n- libtommath now uses the same random source as Dropbear (in 2020.79\nand 2020.80 used getrandom() separately)\n- Some fuzzing improvements, start of a dbclient fuzzer\n2020.80 - 26 June 2020\n- Don't block authorized\\_keys logins with no-X11-forwarding or no-agent-forwarding\nrestrictions when X11 or agent forwarding are disabled at compile time.\nThis is more of a problem now X11 is disabled by default, reported by Guilhem Moulin\n- Reduce binary size by 4kB (x64) when using bundled libtommath\n- Define GNU\\_SOURCE for getrandom() on uclibc, reported by Laurent Bercot and\nFabrice Fontaine\n- Improve checking libtomcrypt version compatibility\n- Add some style notes to DEVELOPING.md\n2020.79 - 15 June 2020\n- Support ed25519 hostkeys and authorized\\_keys, many thanks to Vladislav Grishenko.\nThis also replaces curve25519 with a TweetNaCl implementation that reduces code size.\n- Add chacha20-poly1305 authenticated cipher. This will perform faster than AES\non many platforms. Thanks to Vladislav Grishenko\n- Support using rsa-sha2 signatures. No changes are needed to hostkeys/authorized\\_keys\nentries, existing RSA keys can be used with the new signature format (signatures\nare ephemeral within a session). Old ssh-rsa signatures will no longer\nbe supported by OpenSSH in future so upgrading is recommended.\n- Use getrandom() call on Linux to ensure sufficient entropy has been gathered at startup.\nDropbear now avoids reading from the random source at startup, instead waiting until\nthe first connection. It is possible that some platforms were running without enough\nentropy previously, those could potentially block at first boot generating host keys.\nThe dropbear \"-R\" option is one way to avoid that.\n- Upgrade libtomcrypt to 1.18.2 and libtommath to 1.2.0, many thanks to Steffen Jaeckel for\nupdating Dropbear to use the current API. Dropbear's configure script will check\nfor sufficient system library versions, otherwise using the bundled versions.\n- CBC ciphers, 3DES, hmac-sha1-96, and x11 forwarding are now disabled by default.\nThey can be set in localoptions.h if required.\nBlowfish has been removed.\n- Support AES GCM, patch from Vladislav Grishenko. This is disabled by default,\nDropbear doesn't currently use hardware accelerated AES.\n- Added an API for specifying user public keys as an authorized\\_keys replacement.\nSee pubkeyapi.h for details, thanks to Fabrizio Bertocci\n- Fix idle detection clashing with keepalives, thanks to jcmathews\n- Include IP addresses in more early exit messages making it easier for fail2ban\nprocessing. Patch from Kevin Darbyshire-Bryant\n- scp fix for CVE-2018-20685 where a server could modify name of output files\n- SSH\\_ORIGINAL\\_COMMAND is set for \"dropbear -c\" forced command too\n- Fix writing key files on systems without hard links, from Matt Robinson\n- Compatibility fixes for IRIX from Kazuo Kuroi\n- Re-enable printing MOTD by default, was lost moving from options.h. Thanks to zciendor\n- Call fsync() is called on parent directory when writing key files to ensure they are flushed\n- Fix \"make install\" for manpages in out-of-tree builds, from Gabor Z. Papp\n- Some notes are added in DEVELOPING.md\n2019.78 - 27 March 2019\n- Fix dbclient regression in 2019.77. After exiting the terminal would be left\nin a bad state.

Thanks to Mark Shepard for reporting the crash.\nCVE-2017-9078 https://hg.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/rev/c8114a48837c\n- Security: Fix information disclosure with ~/.ssh/authorized\\_keys symlink.\nDropbear parsed authorized\\_keys as root, even if it were a symlink. The fix\nis to switch to user permissions when opening authorized\\_keys\nA user could symlink their ~/.ssh/authorized\\_keys to a root-owned file they\ncouldn't normally read.
