How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

A vulnerability has been discovered in the popular E-Commerce package
'phpShop'. The vulnerability's details are available in the attached
advisory, or at <http://www.fribble.net/advisories/phpshop_29-04-04.txt>

Due to the nature of this vulnerability, I notified the lead programmer
for this package over a week ago, and no reply or patch has yet been
released.

Once again, this unfortunately another PHP package falling victim to
the 'register globals substitution' vulnerability that many other high-
profile packages have had (phpNuke, phpBB, just to name a couple). When
will people learn that replacing one bad configuration error with a (even
worse!) programming one is NOT the way to migrate into new versions of
PHP.

-------------- 29/04/2004 --------------
Security Advisory - Arbitrary code inclusion vulnerability in phpShop

Discovered by: Calum Power [Enune]
Advisory Date: 29/04/2004
Versions Affected: <= 0.7.1
Unaffected versions: None Known (Developer contacted 29/04/04)

Product Description: (From product website)
phpShop is a PHP-based e-commerce application and PHP development framework.
phpShop offers the basic features needed to run a successful e-commerce web site and
to extend its capabilities for multiple purposes.

Summary:
Under certain circumstances, it may be possible to execute arbitrary code in the context of
the web server.

Details:
If PHP is configured (in php.ini, or otherwise) to have register_globals turned off, and the
PHP version is above or equal to 4.1, then a phpShop installation will initiate a 'fix' to
register all the globals in the HTTP_REQUEST into local variables. One of these variables is
the '$base_dir' variable, which is used to declare the base directory of the phpshop
installation. If the aforementioned events are triggered (as in most recent default PHP
installations), it is possible to overwrite the $base_dir variable (in a GET, POST or COOKIE
declaration), and taint the many lines of code from 'htdocs/index.php
UPDATE(9/05): It has been discovered that ANY version of PHP with register_globals turned off
would be vulnerable to exploit.

Exploit:
An attacker would only need to create a file called 'phpshop.cfg' on his or her webserver
in a directory called 'etc', and craft the base_dir variable to include the code from his webserver,
and the phpShop will include this code into it's page, assuming that the attacker's script is the
configuration for the phpShop. It is then possible for the attacker to take control over the website
and/or server, and perform malicious activities at will.

Impact:
The impact of this vulnerability could be quite devastating for some companies, who rely on
the security of packages such as phpShop to run their businesses online. The ramifications
could be things such as the redirection of deliveries to customers to an address the attacker
controls, or the hijacking of Credit Card details.
