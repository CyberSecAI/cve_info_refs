The provided content relates to the following vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input validation in `showini.asp`.
- Direct file access due to insufficient input validation in `showlog.asp`.
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation in `show.asp` and `showperf.asp`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory traversal
- Direct file access
- Cross-site scripting

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file access on the server, potentially including sensitive system files.
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser (XSS).

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable scripts (`showini.asp`, `showlog.asp`, `show.asp`, `showperf.asp`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the Sambar Proxy server.
- Basic understanding of HTTP and web vulnerabilities.
- Default administrator account has no password by default, making initial access easier if the admin interface is exposed to the network.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was tested on Sambar 6.1 Beta 2 running on Windows (x86), but other versions and platforms may also be vulnerable.
- The vendor was notified and planned to fix these vulnerabilities in the next release.
- A workaround is to set a password for the admin account and restrict administration to localhost.
