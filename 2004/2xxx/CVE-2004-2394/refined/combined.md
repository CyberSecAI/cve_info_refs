| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=120060#c0)  Steve Grubb    2004-04-05 17:50:44 UTC  ``` From Bugzilla Helper: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i586; en-US; rv:1.4.2) Gecko/20040308  Description of problem: During a code review, I found several issues with the programs in the passwd rpm. Notibly, the passwd program has an off by 1 in the case of --stdin. buffer is 80, len passed to read is 79, location 78 is 0'ed. This is more noticeable if you imagine i == 1 after read. Also, if read returns an error, the program continues as if nothing bad happened and tries to zero buffer[-2];  Also, pam_start was not being checked for its return code.  Various minor memory leaks.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): passwd-0.68  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: Found during code review.       Additional info:  I will attach a patch that fixes these. I did not look at prior versions to see if these issues exist.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=120060#c1)  Steve Grubb    2004-04-05 17:52:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 99118](attachment.cgi?id=99118&action=diff "Patch that fixes bugs found by code review.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=99118&action=edit "Patch that fixes bugs found by code review.") Patch that fixes bugs found by code review.  Please apply before releasing fedora core 2.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=120060#c2)  Steve Grubb    2004-05-03 15:10:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 99912](attachment.cgi?id=99912&action=diff "Revised patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=99912&action=edit "Revised patch") Revised patch  The off by one problem was found to be used to remove the \n. Therefore the patch needed updating. Please use this one instead.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=120060#c3)  Alan Cox    2004-07-27 20:25:29 UTC  ``` Note btw that there is a small behavioour change if the user uses ^V before newl ine characters. The new behaviour seems somewhat wiser however.     ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=120060#c4)  Steve Grubb    2004-07-27 21:15:42 UTC  ``` At one point, I had:   if (i && newPassword[i-1] == '\n')     newPassword[i-1] = 0;  It was suggested on vend-sec to just do a strchr instead. I suppose they may have meant strrchr.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=120060#c5)  Jindrich Novy    2004-09-02 11:46:17 UTC  ``` Hello Steve, most things from your patch were applied.  Thanks, Jindrich   ``` |  |
