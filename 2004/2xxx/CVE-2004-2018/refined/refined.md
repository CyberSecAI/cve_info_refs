Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability information related to **[waraxe-2004-SA#029] - Possible remote file inclusion in PhpNuke 6.x - 7.3**:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** issue. This suggests that the application allows an attacker to include remote files into the application's execution flow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application is vulnerable to RFI, meaning it can be tricked into loading and executing code from a remote server controlled by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server. The included file, if malicious, will be executed with the privileges of the web server.
- **Complete System Compromise:** This could allow an attacker to gain complete control over the server and potentially access sensitive data or perform further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker would need to craft a malicious HTTP request to the vulnerable application to include a file from a remote server.
- **Remote Server:** The attacker needs a remote server to host the malicious file that will be included by the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the RFI vulnerability present in the PhpNuke versions 6.x-7.3.
- **Malicious Code:** The attacker needs to possess or create a malicious script that can be uploaded to the attacker's server and then included via the vulnerable application.
