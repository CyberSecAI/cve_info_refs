    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The Red-Alert device reboots when a web request longer than approximately 1230 bytes is sent to TCP port 80.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Lack of proper input validation/handling for web requests.",
          "Vulnerability to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks."
        ],
        "impact": "Remote reboot of the Red-Alert probe, leading to loss of all locally logged events.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Sending a web request larger than 1230 bytes to the device's TCP port 80.",
          "Unauthenticated remote attacker."
        ],
         "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the target device on port 80. No authentication is required."

      {
        "root_cause": "User authentication is tied to the source IP address, not individual user sessions.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Insecure session management.",
          "Insufficient protection against unauthorized access within a shared IP environment."
        ],
        "impact": "Multiple users behind the same NAT or proxy can access the Red-Alert GUI without individual authentication after one user authenticates, potentially leading to unauthorized access and modification.",
        "attack_vectors": [
           "Network access to the Red-Alert web interface from behind the same IP.",
           "Any user behind a shared IP after one user authenticates."
          ],
        "attacker_capabilities":"The attacker needs to be behind the same NAT or proxy as a previously authenticated user."

         {
        "root_cause": "The Red-Alert device does not correctly handle SSID strings containing multiple space characters.",

          "Improper string handling for SSID values.",
          "Potential for inconsistent representation of wireless network names."

        "impact": "The device fails to correctly identify SSIDs that contain multiple space characters, representing them as a single space character, possibly causing issues in monitoring and reporting.",
        "attack_vectors":"Wireless networks with SSIDs using multiple space characters.",
        "attacker_capabilities":"The attacker needs to be able to create wireless networks with specific SSIDs that include multiple spaces."
