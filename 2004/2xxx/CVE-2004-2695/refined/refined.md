**Content Analysis:**

The provided content is primarily related to the release of vBulletin 3.0.4 and subsequent bug fixes. While it doesn't explicitly detail the vulnerability associated with CVE-2004-2695, it does mention a critical security fix that likely addresses it.

**Relevant Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The release announcement mentions "a hole in vBulletin that could potentially allow SQL injection".
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** The announcement indicates that the SQL injection vulnerability was critical enough to warrant an immediate update to version 3.0.4, which suggests the potential for significant impact.  Based on the general nature of SQL injection vulnerabilities, this could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete data in the database. It may also lead to the compromise of the entire web server.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through SQL injection, which means by crafting malicious input to the application. The specific attack vector is not explicitly defined in the content provided.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to send malicious SQL queries to the application. This can typically be achieved through the web interface, with no need for direct access to the server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The release notes also mention the prevention of POST requests from off-site forms, possibly related to another vulnerability or general hardening, however it is not directly related to the SQL injection.
*   The announcement urges users to upgrade PHP to at least version 4.3.10 or 5.0.3 to avoid recently published vulnerabilities, but this is unrelated to CVE-2004-2695 as it is a separate issue with the PHP engine.
*   The content provides a comprehensive list of bugs fixed in version 3.0.4 but doesn't go into specifics of the SQL injection exploit.

**Summary of CVE-2004-2695:**
