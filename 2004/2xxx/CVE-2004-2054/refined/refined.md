Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Vulnerability:** HTTP Response Splitting & Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:**
- **HTTP Response Splitting:** The `privmsg.php` ('mode' parameter) and `login.php` ('redirect' parameter) scripts in phpBB do not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in HTTP headers.
- **XSS:** The `search.php` script does not sanitize the `search_author` parameter when magic quotes are turned off in php.ini.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input sanitization leading to HTTP response splitting.
- Improper input sanitization leading to cross-site scripting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **HTTP Response Splitting:**
    - Web cache poisoning.
    - Cross-user defacement.
    - Hijacking pages with sensitive user information.
    - Cross-site scripting attacks.
- **XSS:**
    - Theft of cookies associated with the domain.
    - Execution of client-side scripts in the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Response Splitting:** Attacker crafts a malicious URL, injecting CRLF characters (%0d%0a) into the `mode` parameter of `privmsg.php` or the `redirect` parameter of `login.php` along with additional headers and content.
- **XSS:** Attacker crafts a malicious URL with JavaScript in the `search_author` parameter of `search.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **HTTP Response Splitting:** No user login is required. An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable script.
- **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to get a user to click a malicious link or inject the malicious link in a place where a user may click it.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was tested on phpBB 2.0.4 and 2.0.9.
- The HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability is confirmed to affect Microsoft web servers, and potentially WebSTAR and Xitami.
- The advisory provides specific example requests and responses illustrating how the vulnerabilities can be exploited.
- The advisory mentions that these issues are addressed in PhpBB 2.0.10.
- The XSS vulnerability is conditional on `magic_quotes_gpc` being turned off in `php.ini`.
