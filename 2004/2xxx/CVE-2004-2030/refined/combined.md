Advisory Name: Liferay Cross Site Scripting flaw
 Release Date: 05/22/2004
  Application: Liferay ([www.liferay.com](http://www.liferay.com))
       Author: Sandeep Giri
Vendor Status: Notified ( 4 months ago)

Overview:
(Taken from <http://www.liferay.com/products/index.jsp>)

Liferay Enterprise Portal was designed to:

Provide organizations with a single sign-on web interface for email,
document
management, message board, and other useful communication tools.
Multiple
authentication schemes (LDAP or SQL) are pooled together so users don't
have
to remember a different login and password for every section of the
portal.
...

Details:

Liferay is prone to cross site scripting flaw. Almost all the fields
that takes
input from one user and are displayed on another user's screen can be
tricked to
execute java script code.

Test:
Add a message with subject <script>history.go(-1)</script>
Now, no user can see message board.

Vendor Response:
Vendor was notified on 14/01/2004. No fix have been released yet.

Recommendation:

While saving or displaying the data:
replace &,<,> etc with &amp;,&lt; and &gt; respectively.

Regards,
Sandeep Giri

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
