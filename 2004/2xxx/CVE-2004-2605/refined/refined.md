    {
      "cve": "CVE-2004-2605",
      "root_cause": "The `astats` script creates temporary files in an insecure manner, using predictable names in `/tmp` without proper checks to prevent symlink attacks.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure temporary file creation.",
        "Lack of protection against symlink attacks.",
         "Predictable temporary file names."

      "impact": "A local attacker could exploit the insecure temporary file creation to overwrite or manipulate arbitrary files via symlink attacks.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local access",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to create files and symlinks in the `/tmp` directory and execute the vulnerable script."
