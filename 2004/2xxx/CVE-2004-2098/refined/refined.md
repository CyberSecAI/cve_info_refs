- **Root cause of vulnerability**: TBE's HTML banner creation feature does not perform input sanitization or validation, directly writing user-supplied content into a file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Code injection, specifically server-side script execution. The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to insert malicious code within an HTML banner.
- **Impact of exploitation**: When an HTML banner containing injected code is viewed or previewed, the malicious code is executed on the server. This can potentially allow an attacker to gain control of the web server, depending on the web server configuration, leading to significant damage to the server and connected systems.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the HTML banner creation feature of TBE. An attacker provides malicious code in an HTML banner which is then saved to a file that can be executed by the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the capability to create HTML banners within the TBE system.
