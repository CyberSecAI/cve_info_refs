{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple issues were found during a code review of the passwd program, including an off-by-one error when processing input via --stdin, lack of error checking for pam_start, and minor memory leaks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Off-by-one error in `passwd` program when reading from stdin. The buffer is 80 bytes, the length passed to `read` is 79, and location 78 is zeroed out which is used for the null terminator. If read returns an error the program continues and attempts to zero out buffer[-2].",
    "Missing error check for the return value of the `pam_start` function.",
    "Various minor memory leaks"
   ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The off-by-one error could lead to buffer overflow when processing input via --stdin.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities can be triggered by providing specially crafted input to the `passwd` program, particularly when using the --stdin option.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute the `passwd` program and provide input via the --stdin option."
