How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[Workaround]

The following workaround may be applied to circumvent this vulnerability.
Please apply the workaround until the fixed version is applied to your system.

Model: P-F2463-61141, P-2451-2124, P-2451-2134

No workaround exits.

Model: P-2451-2154

1.  When "2" is specified for the PAGE_GENERATOR_EDITION property in

the runtime environment definition file (WebPGen.cfg):

Application of the template file analysis engine intermediate language
generation mode is specified. This problem will not occur in this case.

2.  When "2" is not specified for the PAGE_GENERATOR_EDITION
property in the runtime environment definition file (WebPGen.cfg):
(No specification is made or the specification has been changed to normal
mode)

(1)

Setting in the configuration file
By setting the following definitions in the runtime environment
definition file (WebPGen.cfg), the template file analysis engine of
the intermediate language generation mode will be used. In addition,
this problem will not occur in intermediate language generation
mode.

Definition example

 PAGE_GENERATOR_EDITION= 2

(2) Change necessary in the system

When the above setup is completed, the template file will be
interpreted and executed in the intermediate language generation
mode. In this case, the following change is needed.

    (a) It is necessary to specify the compatible option with the normal

mode in the runtime environment definition file (WebPGen.cfg). (For
details, see the README.)

    (b) In the intermediate language generation mode, since the comment

format of the macro definition file (Macro.cfg) and the method
definition file (Method.cfg) are changed to "<!@BCOMMENT>~
<!/BCOMMENT>" from "#", the items such as the macros and
methods are commented out by "#" and loaded. Therefore, it is
necessary to change the macro definition file and the method
definition file.

    (c) In the intermediate language generation mode, since the template file

analysis is strictly processed and syntax errors may occur, there are
cases in which a template file must be corrected. (For details, see the
manual.)

    (d) In the intermediate language generation mode, more memory and

disk space are required compared with the normal mode for the
cache function of intermediate language generation. Therefore, it is

necessary to estimate this capacity beforehand. (For details, refer to
the README.)

Revision history

2451-2154 is updated.
August 6, 2004: The information about obtaining the corrected versions is
