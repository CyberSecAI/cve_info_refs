Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in ASPRunner as described:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper input sanitization/validation in ASP pages when constructing SQL queries.
    *   **Weakness:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into database queries.
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; potentially leading to complete database compromise.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Through HTTP requests, by manipulating parameters used in ASP pages.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Requires the attacker to be able to interact with the application by sending HTTP requests with malicious parameters.

2.  **Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Exposing sensitive information via hidden HTML fields, SQL query details, and verbose error messages.
    *  **Weakness:** Improper handling and presentation of sensitive information to the user.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the database structure, table names, field names, and internal queries used by the application.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  By examining the HTML source, intercepting HTTP requests and responses, or triggering error conditions.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires ability to examine web application traffic (either through a browser or intercepting).

3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper input sanitization/encoding when displaying user-supplied data in the web pages.
    *   **Weakness:**  Allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed by other users in their browsers.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, and redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By injecting malicious javascript via HTTP requests.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to manipulate parameters in HTTP requests.

4.  **Database Download:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Database files are stored within the web serverâ€™s accessible directory, allowing direct download.
    *   **Weakness:**  Unrestricted access to database files via HTTP requests.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized download of the entire database, which can lead to complete compromise of sensitive information.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  By direct access to the database file using the web browser.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Requires knowledge (or the ability to guess) the database file path.

**Affected Versions:**

*   ASPRunner version 2.4 and below.

**Vendor Response:**

*   No response or fix from the vendor after being contacted multiple times.
