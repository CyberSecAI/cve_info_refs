| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=162647#c0)  Mark    2004-12-31 23:19:46 UTC  ``` 1. Fetch the problem MP3.  A 50k chunk that reproduces the problem is at <http://excel.xl0.org/angelhead.mp3>; the full 8MB MP3 is at <http://excel.xl0.org/angel.mp3>. 2. Attempt to play the problem MP3 with rhythmbox 0.8.8 or Totem 0.99.22. 3. Observe that the player application will suck up all your memory until it's killed.  Running the MP3 through mp3asm produces a version that no longer crashes the player (<http://excel.xl0.org/angelok.mp3>); this is still kind of an ugly bug, though. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=162647#c1)  Stephane Loeuillet    2005-01-02 12:32:02 UTC  ``` confirmed to eat all memory with latest CVS of everything perhaps an ID3 tag parsing problem (angelok has no ID3 tag)  ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=162647#c2)  Ronald Bultje    2005-01-07 10:43:32 UTC  ``` it hangs in id3_tag_parse().

Subject: libid3tag0: endless loop until OOM while parsing ID3v2 tag
Date: Sat, 16 Apr 2005 14:06:11 +0100
```
Package: libid3tag0
Version: 0.15.1b-4.1
Severity: normal
Tags: patch

libid3tag has problems with some ID3v2 tags. If the ID3v2 tag contains
string list fields with an UTF16 string whose length is an odd number
of bytes (which is effectively a broken string, but should still be
parsed correctly), libid3tag ends up in an endless loop allocating
memory until it can't allocate more memory or the process is killed.

This bug affects a number of applications depending on libid3tag0 for
tag parsing, including many GStreamer-based audio players like rhythmbox
or muine.

A two-line patch is available here:

  <http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162647>

The patch has been sent upstream months ago, but it doesn't look like
there is going to be a new release any time soon.

Would be great if it could be applied to the package until a new
upstream version is released.

Cheers
 -Tim
