- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Reptile web server does not properly handle user input strings, specifically when parsing the HTTP version in a request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate input validation and resource management. The server enters a loop or continues processing even when the HTTP version is not specified.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause excessive CPU consumption on the server by sending crafted HTTP requests lacking the HTTP version string. This could lead to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted HTTP GET requests to the server, omitting the HTTP version string (e.g., "GET index.htm" instead of "GET index.htm HTTP/1.1").
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send network requests to the affected Reptile web server. No special position or capabilities are mentioned beyond network access.
