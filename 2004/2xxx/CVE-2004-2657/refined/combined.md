User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Firefox 0.8
When uninstalling Firefox, preferences and previously-downloaded skins and components are still
saved, even after selecting yes to "Are you sure you want to completely remove Mozilla Firefox (.8)
and all of its components?" and "Not all files were uninstalled from the installation directory:
C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\ Do you want to completely delete this directory?"
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 0.8, add new skins and change various user preferences.
2. Uninstall Firefox, selecting "yes" when asked if one wants to completely remove everything.
3. After uninstalling, completely remove /Documents and Settings/User/Application Data/Mozilla
and /Program Files/[Firefox Directory]
4. Restart
5. Reinstall Firefox in either the same directory as before OR a new one
6. Run Firefox
Actual Results:
Found old skins and preferences still present.
Expected Results:
Removed all saved preferences and skins, giving me a fresh installation.

That information is stored in your profile, not in the Firefox install directory.
If you don't want that stuff with a fresh install, start a new profile.

Shouldn't there at least be an uninstaller option to remove such information for
people who either want a clean wipe of all of that info (since the text of the
uninstaller implies that it's removing EVERTHING) or people who, Allah forbid,
don't plan to use the application again and want every trace of it gone?

I believe that, as an issue of honesty and good PR on an individual-user
basis, the uninstaller should ask the user whether they want to delete the
profile (probably briefly explaining what it contains). Leaving it behind
takes up HD space, and confuses/scares/PO's the heck out of people who try and
fail to fix profile-based bugs by uninstall-reinstall.

Uninstaller should also remove old Firefox <0.8 profile directory /Documents and

installer doesn't remove old Phoenix profiles after copying.

I believe this should block. The reason for this is, a very large majority of
Firefox issues boil down to "uninstall, delete your profile, and start afresh."
However, deleting your profile is a very scary process; you have to go into
areas of your hard drive that Windows usually keeps well hidden from you, often
using %code-y looking variables%, and then manually delete something. This
scares base users stiff.
It would be an ENORMOUS help to those of us who will be providing technical
support for the hoarde of new users we expect at 1.0 if this process could be
simplified and de-scarified by rendering it down to a checkbox in the uninstall
dialogue. I would go as far as to say it would drastically reduce the number of
users who will decide "Firefox is buggy, back to IE" the first time something
goes wrong. Flags: blocking-aviary1.0+

I fully support blocking flag.
It's common sense that any application cleans after itself. Moreover, Firefox is
an application that requireas a "clean start" from time to time (sad fact but a
fact) and just about everyone will assume that it can be done by
uninstall/reinstall. Another fact which you might not like (you might want users
to know about %appdata%), but still a fact.
Removal of profile manager shortcut from installation makes this bug much more
importnat, since right now, there is completely no way to create a new profile
using any UI - hell, there is no indication that profiles exist at all.
Doesn't seem to be much work either, by the way.

we have always errored on the side of not removing data in cases where the user
might not understand the impact of checking a "remove your user profile?" check
box. I'd think we would need to make this kind of change in a beta release
where we could get testing and feedback. An independent utility could be built
that would find and destroy firefox profiles and that program could eventually
be integrated into the installer. some of the old seamonkey profile clean up
code might be a place to start. any volenteers?Flags: blocking-aviary1.0?Flags: blocking-aviary1.0-Keywords: [helpwanted](/buglist.cgi?keywords=helpwanted&resolution=---)

Target milestone is set when a developer decides he's going to fix it, assigns
the bug to himself (marks it ASSIGNED), and then sets it. Ben hasn't marked
this ASSIGNED yet, so the target milestone isn't yet set.

I don't think the person was asking "what target milestone has been set?"
Blind Freddy can see that it's not set yet.
I think that they were asking "What does Ben (or his delegate) have in mind for
this bug? Will it be assigned soon because it will be fixed in the next
release, or will it sit unassigned for longer 'cause it's not a priority?".
I didn't find this question to be SPAM. I signed up to this bug because I'm
interested in what other people are interested in it as well. If someone else
is wondering what Ben's priority for this bug is, that's interesting information
for me too ... it back's up my nagging feeling of "is this one going to be
assigned?".

I recently installed a nightly trunk to see what is coming soon in the next
versions (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2)
Gecko/20050516 Firefox/1.0+). This replaced the general 1.0.3 version I was
using before. I wanted to uninstall the nightly trunk and revert to official
1.0.4 when I noticed it was released.
Now whenever I load older versions of firefox, i get an about:blank browser
screen and cannot use the browser in any way. I feel this is related to the
above bug.

To stick with existing behavior, this field should probably default to
unchecked. This is due to the fact that many users glaze over any options when
(un)installing software, and it is better to be safe than sorry when it comes to
dataloss.
A. The simplest form of this checkbox would be:
"Uninstall profile [ ]"
However, I believe that the "profile" is an ambiguous term for many users and
needs to be explained.
B. Something like this would be better:
"Remove profile settings (including bookmarks, themes, and extensions) [ ]"
C. Another option is to use a simple phrase on the checkbox, but have a small
paragraph below that checkbox explaining what a profile is and when it
should/n't be removed. Unfortunately, statements like this are usually ignored
by users and generally clutter the UI more than anything else.

Right. And don't forget about passwords and other user data. What about
prefs.js and user.js?
You have to target the deletion or you will have an even bigger problem. You
can't just go removing the whole profile, including bookmarks, or you will have
a repeat of the bookmarks debacle, only much worse.
Also, don't forget that this could delete user files, possibly leading to
catastrophic data loss. See [bug 302087](/show_bug.cgi?id=302087 "NEW - Inadequate warning before Profile Manager deletes non-Mozilla files"). How about combining this fix with [bug
278230](/show_bug.cgi?id=278230 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Pointing new profiles to directory other than default may cause loss of data when deleting the profile") (which is about Profile Manager deleting user files, and which should be
reopened)? If you carefully target the deletions, this will automatically
protect users.
This bug fix would solve an enormous number of user support problems. It's been
open 1 1/2 years. I don't understand why it's not blocking.

I think that the take all or nothing approach would be better.
You want to delete the profile:
a)When you stop using Firefox and don't want to leave stuff floating around.
b)The profile is screwed up, In this case, there is no point to try target every deletion. But if you want to do targeted deletion then options to save Bookmarks and passwords should be enough.
I would like to see something like this:

Had a quick look through this and a few key questions aren't answered here. Should this option remove all profiles or just the current? And what about other users on the system, quite often the user uninstalling firefox may well not be able to access their profiles making it impossible to remove them.

I've been thinking about this and I don't think it's a good idea. The installer didn't create the profile, so the uninstaller shouldn't remove it. Besides which removing the current user's profile(s) means that the activity of the uninstaller is non-determinite. WONTFIX.Status: NEW → RESOLVEDClosed: 19 years agoResolution: --- → WONTFIX

Adding a checkbox (that's off by default) to the uninstaller that deletes the profiles directory can't possibly be a huge development job, yet would solve so many support issues. So many people get issues with Firefox and the first thing they try or are even told to do is uninstall / reinstall, yet the vast majority of cases this solves nothing because the issue is in the profile, and it's a pain for anyone to figure out where the profile is and delete it. I don't see why this would be not implemented on technical reasons.

I have suggested in the past that there should be a profile verifying utility to make sure everything is proper. Whether this utility be part of the program or a standalone item is up for question. There is no doubt that profile corruption is an issue, and not many can answer the question of what a proper profile should look like.

How can this bug be blocking Firefox 2 and WONTFIX?

"non-determinite"? Sure the installer didn't create the profile. Sure there could be more than one profile. Sure they could be in diverse locations. Sure there could be profiles under other user accounts.
But, as I've already said in [bug 258301 comment #12](/show_bug.cgi?id=258301#c12 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - extensions manager should purge known per-extension pref space on uninstall"): we should give the user the option to do a clean uninstallation. Leaving about 50 MB of cached data behind isn't really nice (what if every application did this)?
Of course this shouldn't happen per default, but what are you going to suggest to a user wanting a CLEAN reinstallation? To find a folder which is per default nicely hidden by Windows Explorer and delete that folder by hand? [annoyed] What again do we have an uninstaller for? [/annoyed]
I kindly ask to discuss this issue in the newsgroups before WONTFIXING this bug again.Status: RESOLVED → REOPENEDResolution: WONTFIX → ---

Feel free to open a thread on mozilla.dev.apps.firefox. I am willing to spend time listening to arguments there, though I haven't seen anything yet that overrides my concerns for a determinite installer, as well as providing a checkbox that users might click thinking it does something it doesn't do.
The uninstaller is primarily there to uninstall the application. It is not there to uninstall user data. For the moment I will stick by my module-owner decision. Please do not reopen this bug.Status: REOPENED → RESOLVEDClosed: 19 years ago → 19 years agoResolution: --- → WONTFIX

> Leaving about 50 MB of cached data behind isn't really nice
> (what if every application did this)?
In Windows, most applications do leave any personal data behind on uninstall. Microsoft Office, for instance, does. In fact, I cannot think of a single major Windows application that on uninstall goes through and cleans all that out. It wouldn't even be (directly) possible to do so if some users had used the "make my files private" checkbox.
On Unix, there is no single uninstall paradigm across different distributions, but for those with which I'm familiar (rpm, ports and packages, deb, portage), it is not normal for any user data or even configuration data (in /etc) to be removed when the application is uninstalled. The general thinking is that if you ever install again the users will want such things.
In summary, it is NOT normal for application uninstallers to remove personal data from user accounts.
Cleaning out just the profile of the \_current\_ user (the one doing the uninstall) would only make sense on systems where the user normally runs things like web browsers all the time with the same privileges required to do the uninstall, cheifly, Win95/98/Me. (Okay, some users on \*nix and many on WinXP run as root/admin all the time (I do so myself at home), but this is \*widely\* disrecommended, for good reasons, and Firefox should not actively encourage it.) Those systems have all entered (or gone past) the twilight of Extended Support, so it seems silly to do something just for them now.
For the uninstaller, I don't think it makes sense to do any more than \_perhaps\_ include a paragraph someplace, explaining that users might still have profile data in their accounts.
However, as far as the Firefox user support issue, Firefox \*should\* provide an easy way for the current user to delete the current user's own profiles, and it \*should\* be accessible when Firefox is started with the -safe-mode switch, as well as when it's started normally. I would suggest opening a separate bug for that, and referencing the number here, because I don't think it belongs in the uninstaller component.

The fact is, she is 100% correct, after reading the article I went to my Windows 2000 Pro machine and went to tools > Options > Passwords > View Saved Passwords > Passwords Never Saved and there were a list of sites that I did not want passwords saved for. I then chose Clear Private Data and went back into the password manager. The list was still there. Lastly, I created a new user account, went into Password manager; guess what…the list was still there. Not only is the list not cleared with private data, it is also shared between user accounts on the same machine.

A better proposition would probably be this:
1. Uninstall application; profile remains.
2. Reinstall application.
3. First run for each user: application detects existing profile(s); gives user option of using the old profile or starting fresh.
Probably should open a new bug for this one (or find one that already exists).

Don't forget that when first installing, it creates the profile FOR YOU!

I think this is not an uninstaller problem, but not an installer problem either (see [bug #264209](/show_bug.cgi?id=264209 "NEW - Installer should provide options if an old profile is found")).
I think Firefox/Mozilla should simply check the profile when started and detect if the last time that profile was used it was with an older browser version, in which case the end-user should be provided with these options:
1: remove the old profile and create a brand new one, or
2: backup (copy?) the old profile and try to use it with the new version

User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1
This privacy flaw has caused my fiancé and I to break-up after having dated for 5 years.
Basically, we share one computer but under separate Windows XP user accounts. We both use Mozilla Firefox -- well, he used to use it more than I do but now we don't really use it. The privacy flaw is this: when he went to log-in under his dating sites (jdate.com, swinglifestyle.com, adultfriendfinder.com, etc.), Mozilla promptly asks whether or not he'd like Firefox to save the passwords for him. He chose never, obviously. However, when he logged off his user account, and I logged onto my Windows XP account X amount of days later, I decided to use Firefox because hey -- it loaded everything much more efficiently, was better to work on with website designs and is a lot more stable than IE7beta2.
Firefox prompted whether or not I'd like it to save my password for logging into my website. I chose never and changed my mind. I went into the Password Manager to change the saved password option from Never to Always and that's when I saw all these other sites that had been selected as "Never Save Password." Of course, those were sites I had never visited or could ever dream of visiting.
Then I realized who, how and what... and sh\*t hit the fan. Your browser does not efficiently respect the privacy of different users for one system.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create 2 unique user accounts (for steps sake, let's call the two accounts Joe and Mary) in Windows XP Home.
2. Logout and sign-in under Joe.
3. Open Firefox and go to an e-mail site or to jdate.com or wherever.
4. Attempt to log-in to the site so that Firefox will ask whether or not you want your password saved.
5. Choose not to save the password.
6. After successfully logging in and having selected the "never save password" option, logout.
7. Log-in as Mary and open Firefox.
8. Browse, browse, browse... but you don't really have to. Just go to "View Saved Passwords," click on the tab that will show you sites to never save passwords for, and you'll see whatever painful site Joe denied to save a password for.
9. Break-up with fiancé.
Firefox should be respecting every single area of privacy per user on one system. It's not doing that... I'm going to submit this as Major because not everyone shares one computer, but it should really be considered Critical.

I don't know if you still have access to the computer you and your ex-fiancé shared, but it sounds like Firefox was sharing a profile between the two Windows XP user accounts. How is that possible -- were both users administrators or something? Were bookmarks separate?Keywords: [privacy](/buglist.cgi?keywords=privacy&resolution=---)

Or, as sp3000 points out, maybe he accidentally logged into one of those sites while you were logged into Windows XP.

All right, I think it's been figured out.
When we decided to have separate user accounts just a short time ago,
since the computer is mine and the log-in we used to share was mine,
we just ended up creating a separate user account for him. However,
before that, he had installed and uninstalled another version of
Firefox in his own personal directory. The first time this happened,
he was trying to hide this stuff from me by using Firefox and
participating on the sites in there. I found out he had been using
another browser by one time accidentally sneaking up on him in the
middle of the night and he uninstalled it. Later, after we had
separate user accounts, I installed Mozilla because it was great in
testing browser compatibility for websites in progress and it must
have picked up certain things from his previous profile. He swears up
and down he never did it while logged-in to my account and I can't see
him messing up like that. This is the only explanation I can think
of.
Regardless, even if the sites in the "Never Save Password" list were
from weeks ago, the sites show he's been logging in regularly and is
an active member. So whatever... I guess when he uninstalled Firefox
originally, it wasn't a completely clean uninstall. That's the only
explanation since we couldn't duplicate my reported bug as easily as
we thought.
Also, I'm going to put this bug as dependent on that uninstallation of profile data bug that Jesse Ruderman sent me. It seems new users will risk seeing old data on a new installation of the browser (after a complete uninstallation had been done). I can't confirm that by replicating it, but I can just confirm it from this one time occurance at the moment.Depends on: [234680](/show_bug.cgi?id=234680 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Uninstall should give the option to remove profile data")

Reporter - where firefox is installed doesn't affect where the profiles are. If he installed it while logged in under your windows account it doesn't matter what folder he installed it to. This in itself isn't a flaw, but a feature. Anyway, that's why you experienced the behaviour you did.
And ok, bugzilla isn't the place for this, but I can't help it. Honey, I would think you would be the LAST person to be bothered by this. Not only did was he using your computer to be unfaithful, he wasn't smart enough to cover his tracks, and you got to know about it BEFORE buying the goods. If you're really THAT upset about finding out, take him back and pretend you never knew, or hold it over his head and use it to keep him in line.

I would also like to add that this seems more like a 'feature' at this point. There is a button under Tools > Options > Privacy > History. On the History tab, I believe, you will see a button for 'Erase My Relationship', underwhich, there are check boxes for '..because he is a cheating bastard', '..because he is a sneaky bastard who demeans me by thinking he can go behind my back', and '..because he jerked is insultingly stupid, so stupid, he deserved to be snared and he would have been a liability to have in your life, long-term'.
Check all that apply..
Ian
ps: in all fairness, and not to sound like a two-dimensional bore, it's possible he was a habitual browser -- along with the being a liar -- where he just BROWSED the sites and looked at profiles, etc.. There's no telling whether he ever DID or would have had the cahones to really get out there and do something... Maybe he just fantasized. Maybe he just made-believe.. If that helps. It's a difficult thing to bridle the male sex drive.
Nevertheless, the problem is still that he lied.. he concealed..
Maybe this was a huge wake-up call after 5 years... maybe he's not the guy you thought he was... maybe its been 5 years of deception... Or, maybe it was just minor 'reveal' and not evidence of deep, serious transgression...just a 'white lie' where he was covering up some fantasy needs...and the 'white lie' need only be a bump in a long, long road and you can see if you can turn it into a growing experience..a call for a whole new level of openness in your relationship..
If the relationship is otherwise a complete wash, what is there to lose? Get it all out on the table.. Tell him he might as well say what he REALLY wants in his life.. what would his 'fantasy perfect male existence' be? Get it stated, honestly and openly for once.. And then see whats what..
Best of luck..
Oh, and I WOULD double-check the credit card / phone records while you are at it...

The fact is, she is 100% correct, after reading the article I went to my
Windows 2000 Pro machine and went to tools > Options > Passwords > View Saved
Passwords > Passwords Never Saved and there were a list of sites that I did not
want passwords saved for. I then chose Clear Private Data and went back into
the password manager. The list was still there. Lastly, I created a new user
account, went into Password manager; guess what…the list was still there. Not
only is the list not cleared with private data, it is also shared between user
accounts on the same machine.

I'm somewhat confused as to how this can happen. I have tried creating both a second profile in my normal user account, and using a separate windows account. None of them had the same list of passwords not to save, as expected the two new accounts had empty lists.
Does that list get imported from IE settings or something like that?

I have a guest account on my computer just for the purpose of making Firefox the default, and there isn't anything listed in password manager either.

i was able to recreate this by going to the password-never-saved list under a second user account on my Windows 2000 pro computer. Yikes! Although i only use opera for my porn-and-personal sites because of fears of the gf finding something in IE or Firefox.... There are other reasons this could be a big problem. Not just for cheating boyfriends, but, roommates who use one computer and maybe save or dont save info for shopping, school sites, etc.

I gotta say, I think lovelivelife12345@yahoo.com is right, it's possible that he just continued to browse those sites. They don't keep track of anything other than access, and it's possible that user activity is exaggerated to make the site appear more busy and worth subscribing to than it is. A relationship of 5 years is a big deal, and it'd be worth it to talk it out. Of course, he did lie, but when faced with a difficult to explain situation, one in which me may be completely innocent, the first and strongest urge is to lie. Just shows he wants to preserve the relationship really. I know, from being married for several years, that a misunderstanding can lead to some pretty big conflicts and there are thigns that, for the sake of simply avoiding a misunderstanding, I wouldn't want my wife to know, especially without a carefully thought out explanation prepared in advance. If he's unprepared to answer a charge his reaction will likely be to lie about it, even if he hasn't, really especially if he hasn't actually cheated on you.

Are people who watch the Sopranos mob-style criminals?
Are people who watch SpongeBob interested in living in a pineapple under the sea?
Are women who watch Sex In The City as horny as the ones on the show?
There is some entertainment value to these websites. While you can use them to engage in unfaithful acts, they also could be used just to get a little chuckle, titilation, or self-satisfaction.
Who knows what your fiance was getting out of it.

Mossop - as per [comment #3](/show_bug.cgi?id=330884#c3 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - When different users on one system choose to save or not save passwords for sites, any other user can see sites they not only saved passwords for but can also see what other users have been saving/never saving passwords for.") what \*actually\* happened was that he installed firefox \*before\* they were using seperate windows profiles, so what really happened is this.
1. They're still using the same windows profile,
2. He installs firefox in his director on her computer in her profile i.e. he installs it to c:\fiance\Mozilla Firefox\ instead of to c:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox
3. He uninstalls firefox after she sees him using it
4. They create him his own Windows profile, she keeps using the one they were sharing
5. She installs firefox in a different directory than he did (eg c:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/)
6. As expected, firefox detects the already existing profile on her windows account.

So the real solution is to first make sure you are using a strict multi-user environment before you trust the separation of accounts. On top of that linux has the coolest text editors for progrmming websites, and the nicest implimentation of a web server for testing those sites.

I checked my "passwords never saved" screen, and found only 2. I think they were saved before I unchecked the "remember passwords" box. Since then, I have never had the popup box come up. I think if the "remember passwords" box is left unchecked, (I think it defaults checked), you won't have anything saved.

You have heard it said by them of old time, thou shalt not commit adultery. But I say unto you, That whosoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart. And if your right eye offend you, pluck it out, and cast it from you. For it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast into hell.

I think firefox should provide password protection for read and delete access to list of sites for which password is never saved. The user may not be prompted for password when the list is being appended. If this is the case, you are privacy is protected even if your profile is accidently shared. However, you may have to come up with an excuse if someone asks you for the password or reason for having password on that list. :D

To do this, go to Tools>Options>Privacy>Passwords and click in the "Set Master Password" button.After doing this, the only way to see the saved passwords is by providing the master password.
As I did the above, to see how it worked, I noticed two things:
1)After setting the master password, if you press "View Saved
Passwords", a dialog will appear asking the master password (this is
ok), but if you press cancel on the dialog, a new one appears, insisting
that you enter the master password. I think the dialog should just close
if you doesn't want to see the saved passwords anymore.
2)If you press the cancel on the dialog 5 times, the window with the
saved passwords appear with no saved passwords (this is ok), but in the
"Passwords Never Saved" still shows the sites you chose to never save
the password. If the operation is aborted when the user press cancel on
the dialog, this would be avoided. Is this already registered as a bug?

Really it's not that big of a deal that firefox saves the list of not saved passowrds. Browers are supposed to do this kind of thing. Anyway it would be the cheating boyfriend's job to run a cleaner to clean the history and cache. Seriously if you value your privacy run a history cleaner it's not that complicated.

I can't tell if this is some sort of a parody, or if it's only some of the commenters who think it is. Some comments either don't take it seriously or post innane or offensive remarks and relationship advice. Some tried to deride her use of Windows and tried to suggest Linux (who cares if Linux has nice text editors for making web sites, it doesn't have Dreamweaver or Photoshop. Nvu and the Gimp suck in comparison). One religious nut even spammed bible quotes (I suppose spouting Linux propaganda could count as religious zealotry, too. RMS can be their Jesus, he's got the beard for it).
Sure the original poster related unnecesssary personal details which has piqued a few people's salacious curiosity, but that's no reason to turn this into a personal advice column, and some dubvious advice at that. Surprisingly they all seem to try and defend the fellow. Frankly he sounds like a cad who has tried to cover up his tracks, albeit unsuccessfully, and she may be better off for it. But the concern is genuine. Although you may like prying on other people's personal information, the sword cuts both ways. You shouldn't have to be a computer expert to protect your privacy. True, I myself have acounts on such sites out of curiosity more than anything else, not because I've actually ever cheated on anyone or ever would, but because I'm single and curious. That doesn't mean I want other users of my computer finding this out. Someone living with parents or relatives etc, or living with a partner, are entitled to privacy, even if they are using someone else's computer and account. A lot of marriage or relationship troubles stem from the husband's liking for surfing porn without intent of cheating, though some women consider it a form of cheating. Certainly the Bible Boy poster thinks so. I'll leave him to gouge out his right eye. A stressful job and screaming 2-year-olds waiting at home and maybe a nagging wife may be the cause. It may be symptomatic of deeper trouble. It doesn't matter. We are entitled to privacy, and if Firefox doesn't properly remove private information upon removal of the program itself, that is a problem.
It has been marked a duplicate of the 2-year-old [bug #234680](/show_bug.cgi?id=234680 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Uninstall should give the option to remove profile data") which basically complains that when you uninstall and click "Yes" to completely removing everything, it in fact doesn't. The user profile, buried deep inside a hidden system folder, remains with bookmarks and other privacy details like visited sites and passwords. Surely this is a genuine privacy concern for a browser that likes to poke fun at IE.
It is currently inexplicably marked as "WontFix".

Neither the browser, nor Mozilla employees "like to poke fun of IE." You'll find that attitude more from the users. As for the status of [bug 234680](/show_bug.cgi?id=234680 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Uninstall should give the option to remove profile data"), you'd need to ask the devs as someone already asked in the bug why it's wontfix (no need for bugspam)
Can we close this bug now that it's resolved?

Rather than storing a list of domains, why not store a one-way hash of same?
Comparison has to occur either way. The 'invisibility' problem can be mitigated by displaying a notification pane to the effect of "Passwords entered on this page will not be saved. To remove this site from the list, [click here]."
Really, this has been boneheaded behavior for years, though a source of endless amusement for fiancees and repair technicians.

Hey naomirocks,
I felt compelled to post on here since I have been through something really similar to your story...I had been with my fiance for 8 years (we were engaged for 6 months) when I found proof infidelity. It tore me to pieces...the most awful experience of my life. It's more than a year later and I am living a much better life now. And have started to date a guy who is sincere. It's been even longer for you and I hope you have found a better life too.
To all those women out there who experience infidelity, please please please know if he does it once, he will do it again. You deserve someone who will to be faithful to you, not just someone who says they want to be.

(In reply to [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=330884#c0 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - When different users on one system choose to save or not save passwords for sites, any other user can see sites they not only saved passwords for but can also see what other users have been saving/never saving passwords for."))
I dont know about your fiance but I never save passwords for anything so the list of websites is substantial. And needless to say after I click Never I am Never asked again so its not that big of a deal to me that he has sites listed as Never. Also from all I can see it only tells you the site not the number of times he visited that site so if he is like me and clicked never once 7 months ago and never returned to that site...it would still be listed in the list and it would look bad but if I only got on that site once 7 months ago to check a message I got or something pointless it would surely be taken out of context. I mean how can you convict him on the list of sites when you dont know how often he frequented the sites and for what purpose. What if it was a once and done deal
