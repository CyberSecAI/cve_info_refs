The provided content relates to two bug reports, **Bug 234680** and **Bug 330884**, both of which are marked as duplicates of each other.

**Bug 234680**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is not a vulnerability but a missing feature/enhancement. The Firefox uninstaller does not provide an option to remove user profile data (such as preferences, skins, bookmarks, passwords, etc.) when the application is uninstalled.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** While not a vulnerability in the traditional sense, the lack of an option to remove profile data can lead to privacy concerns. Users might assume that uninstalling the application removes all traces of it, including personal data.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** This issue doesn't have an "exploitation" impact as such, but it can lead to unwanted data persistence.  Old user data remains on the system, which could be a problem for users concerned about privacy or those needing to troubleshoot issues by performing a completely clean install. Also, other users of the same computer could potentially gain access to profile information of users who have uninstalled the application if they use the same windows profile.
*   **Attack vectors:** There isn't a direct attack vector. It is more of a user experience/privacy issue where the uninstaller does not do what is expected (i.e. remove all program related files)
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No attacker capabilities or position are required since this is not a traditional vulnerability. Any user who uninstalls Firefox will leave behind their profile data. This could be a concern if the computer is shared.

**Bug 330884**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is the shared storage of "never save password" lists across different user profiles of Firefox.  If multiple users are using the same Windows account, they will all see the "never save password" list that has been built by every user of that Windows account. If multiple users create a Firefox profile using the same Windows user account, the “never save passwords” list is shared.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** This issue is a privacy vulnerability where one user can see which sites another user has chosen not to save passwords for. This can reveal potentially sensitive information about a user's online activity.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** The impact of this issue is primarily privacy-related. An individual could learn about the sites another user has been visiting even if the other user has not saved any passwords for those sites. This vulnerability can reveal the existence of accounts on certain sites and lead to unintended relationship issues.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is straightforward: a user simply needs to access the password manager settings and view the list of "never save password" sites. This can be done by any user with access to a Firefox profile shared between different users under the same Windows account.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No advanced capabilities are required, an attacker needs to have access to the computer, and be able to access the browser settings. The user must be using a shared profile between multiple user accounts in order for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Relationship between the two bugs:**

Bug 330884 was initially reported as a major privacy flaw due to the sharing of "never save password" lists. However, after investigation, it was determined that this issue was linked to the persistence of old profile data across reinstallations, which is the topic of bug 234680. Thus, bug 330884 was marked as a duplicate of bug 234680.
