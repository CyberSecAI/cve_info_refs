     "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "Multiple issues were addressed, such as buffer overflows, incorrect size calculations, and improper handling of MIME encoding and header parsing.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Buffer overflows",
          "Incorrect size comparisons",
          "Improper MIME header parsing",

        ],
        "impact": "Exploitation could lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution through the processing of specially crafted email messages. This could result in data loss or system compromise. The fixes aim to prevent such issues, including potential infinite loops, premature terminations, and data corruption.",
