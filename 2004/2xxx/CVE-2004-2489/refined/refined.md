The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in IBM Informix IDS 9.4, specifically related to setuid/setgid binaries and message file handling.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

1.  **Buffer Overflow:**  A buffer overflow exists in the handling of the `GL_PATH` environment variable. When a large string is assigned to `GL_PATH`, it causes a segmentation fault within the Informix binaries when they try to process it. The vulnerability appears to be related to how the binaries process the length of the supplied string with the vulnerable binaries. The issue occurs in functions such as `strlen` and `sprintf`.
2.  **Format String Vulnerability:** The Informix binaries search for message files based on the `INFORMIXDIR` environment variable. By manipulating this variable and creating a custom directory structure with modified message files, an attacker can inject format string specifiers (like `%n`) into the message output used by functions such as `printf` and `sprintf`. This enables arbitrary memory writes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Setuid/Setgid Binaries:** Multiple binaries are setuid/setgid, allowing users with lower privileges to execute them with the privileges of the `informix` user or even root, which is exploitable due to the mentioned vulnerabilities.
*   **Insecure Environment Variable Handling:** The binaries improperly handle the `GL_PATH` and `INFORMIXDIR` environment variables, leading to buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The binaries do not validate the length of the `GL_PATH` variable string or the content of message files before processing them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain the privileges of the `informix` user (gid) or root (uid) by exploiting the format string vulnerability using carefully crafted message files. This allows them to execute arbitrary commands with the escalated privileges.
*   **Denial of Service:** The buffer overflow vulnerability can cause the affected binaries to crash, leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities are exploitable by local users with access to the Informix server and the ability to set environment variables. The exploit requires the ability to run the vulnerable binaries.
*   **Environment Variable Manipulation:** Attackers exploit the improper handling of environment variables `GL_PATH` and `INFORMIXDIR` to trigger the buffer overflow and format string vulnerabilities.
*   **Message File Injection:** Attackers manipulate the message files used by the Informix binaries by setting the `INFORMIXDIR` to a controlled location, and injecting format string characters to gain code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker must be a local user who can execute the setuid/setgid binaries on the vulnerable system.
*   **Ability to Set Environment Variables:** The attacker needs to be able to set environment variables like `GL_PATH` and `INFORMIXDIR`.
*   **File System Write Access:** To exploit the format string vulnerability, the attacker must be able to create and modify files in the directory structure set by `INFORMIXDIR`, or a copy of it.

The advisory mentions that the vendor, IBM, addressed these issues and provided details on the fix. It recommends updating to patch level IDS 9.40.UC3, 9.30.UC7 and 7.31.UD7.
