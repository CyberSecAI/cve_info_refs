Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in ASPRunner versions 2.4 and below:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper input sanitization in various pages, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Vulnerable pages do not sanitize user inputs, allowing SQL injection attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to potentially read, modify, or delete database information.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP requests with malicious SQL code in parameters
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Basic knowledge of SQL injection and HTTP requests.

2.  **Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Sensitive information is exposed via hidden fields, filenames, and detailed error messages.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Hidden fields expose SQL queries and database generated table names, detailed error messages leak database info
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can gather sensitive database and application information.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Examining HTTP request/response content, triggering error messages.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to inspect web page source and HTTP requests/responses.

3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of input sanitization, allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code
    *   **Weaknesses:** The application does not properly sanitize user input in several pages, allowing the injection of JavaScript code.
    *   **Impact:** Allows execution of malicious JavaScript in users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, phishing, etc.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP requests with malicious JavaScript in parameters. Specific vulnerable pages are identified.
    *  **Required Capabilities:**  Ability to craft malicious JavaScript payloads and HTTP requests.

4.  **Database Download:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Direct access to database files is possible via web access.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Database files accessible directly through the web server.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can download the entire database if the filename is known or guessed.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Direct HTTP request to database file path if filename is known/guessed
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  Ability to guess the database filename

**Affected Versions:**

*   ASPRunner version 2.4 and below

**Vendor Status:**

*   The vendor was informed multiple times but did not reply and provided no fix.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The SQL injection vulnerability was described as present on "every page" except the login pages.
*   The information disclosure vulnerabilities include revealing database generated table names, full SQL queries, and detailed error messages.
*   The XSS vulnerabilities are present in multiple pages, including `[TABLE]_search.asp`, `[TABLE]_edit.asp`, `[TABLE]_list.asp`, and `export.asp`.
*   The database download vulnerability affects databases such as MS Access, which can be directly accessed via web URLs.
