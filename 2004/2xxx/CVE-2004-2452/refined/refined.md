Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which aligns with the description of CVE-2004-2452:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Cosminexus Portal Framework handles cached content within portlets using the `<ut:cache>` tag library. The issue is that cached content from one user can be incorrectly replaced by, or mixed with, the cached content of another user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Caching:** The primary weakness is the insecure caching mechanism. The portal framework fails to properly isolate cached content on a per-user or per-session basis.
- **Information Disclosure:** This leads to the possibility of sensitive data belonging to one user being exposed to other users. Specifically, when personal information is stored in the cache.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  The main impact is the potential disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker could potentially view personal information or other data belonging to other users of the portal.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** User confidentiality is compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves interaction with the portal website where a portlet is utilizing the `<ut:cache>` tag library for caching.
- It's likely an internal attack by a user of the portal who has access to portlets that use this tag library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid Portal User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user of the vulnerable portal website.
- **Access to Vulnerable Portlets:** The attacker needs to have access to portlets within the portal that utilize the `<ut:cache>` tag library and cache data.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** No special skills are required other than knowing how to use the affected part of the portal application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cosminexus Portal Framework running on Windows, HP-UX, AIX, and Solaris platforms.
- Hitachi has released fixed versions and a temporary workaround.
- The workaround involves disabling access to portlets that use the `<ut:cache>` tag library until the fixed version can be applied.
- The issue is specifically related to the `<ut:cache>` tag library.
