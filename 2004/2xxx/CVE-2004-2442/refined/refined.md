{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Anti-virus software may rely on corrupted headers within ZIP archives to determine if the archive is valid. Attackers can modify these headers to indicate zero-length files, which may cause the anti-virus software to incorrectly interpret the archive.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of ZIP archive headers",
      "Reliance on header information for security checks"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted ZIP archive with malicious content can evade anti-virus detection. If a user extracts and accesses this malicious content, it could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious ZIP archive with modified headers"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to create a modified ZIP archive",
       "Persuade a user to access the malicious archive"
    ],
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability arises because the anti-virus software trusts the ZIP archive headers to provide correct file size information. A malformed header can indicate that the file size is zero, thus causing the AV software to not detect any malware in the archive. While this flaw allows malware to evade detection, the user must still extract the malicious archive to trigger exploitation."
