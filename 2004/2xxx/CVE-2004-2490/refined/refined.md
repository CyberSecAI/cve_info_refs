Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in IBM Informix IDS 9.4:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow exists in the handling of the `GL_PATH` environment variable. The vulnerable binaries attempt to copy the contents of `GL_PATH` into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking.
*   **Format String Vulnerability:** Multiple binaries are vulnerable to format string attacks through the manipulation of message files. When the binaries search for and display messages related to errors, they use a formatted output function that is vulnerable. By manipulating the `INFORMIXDIR` environment variable, an attacker can specify a location where a modified message file can be placed containing format string specifiers that would be parsed by the vulnerable program.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe use of `strcpy` and related functions:** The buffer overflow vulnerability stems from the use of `strcpy` or similar functions without proper bounds checking, leading to the possibility of overflowing the buffer.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate the length of the `GL_PATH` environment variable.
*   **Format String Bugs:** The message file handling code within the binaries is vulnerable to format string exploits via `printf`, which can be abused with carefully crafted inputs in message files.
*   **Setuid/Setgid Binaries:** The presence of setuid and setgid binaries exacerbates the impact of the vulnerabilities as they can be used to obtain the privileges of the informix user or root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** Exploitation of the format string vulnerability using the modified message file through setuid binaries could allow an attacker to gain root privileges.
*   **Denial of Service:** The buffer overflow vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault and program termination, potentially causing a denial of service by crashing the vulnerable binaries.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Using format string vulnerabilities allows arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacks described require the ability to run commands on the local system.
*   **Environment Variable Manipulation:** Setting the `GL_PATH` environment variable to an overly long string triggers the buffer overflow. Manipulating the `INFORMIXDIR` environment variable allows the attacker to control the location of message files.
*   **Message File Modification:** An attacker creates a modified message file containing format string specifiers to execute code through the format string vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute commands on the system where the vulnerable Informix IDS is installed.
*   **File System Write Access:** The format string exploit requires the ability to create or modify files in the file system, specifically the `INFORMIXDIR` directory or equivalent that the attacker designates.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory includes detailed information about the vulnerable binaries, including a list of setuid and setgid programs within the Informix installation.
*   The advisory lists the versions of Informix IDS (9.40.xC, tested 9.40.UC1) and recommends updating to patch level IDS 9.40.UC3, 9.30.UC7, and 7.31.UD7.
*   The advisory also mentions that a working Proof of Concept (PoC) exists.
