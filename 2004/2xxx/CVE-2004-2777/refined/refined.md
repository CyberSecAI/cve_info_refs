**CVE Description:**

The provided content identifies CVE-2004-2777 as related to the GE Image Vault 3.x software, which has an improper authentication vulnerability due to the use of default credentials.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the presence of default or hard-coded credentials in the GE Image Vault 3.x software. This allows anyone with knowledge of these default credentials to bypass the authentication process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The software relies on default credentials that are easily guessable or publicly known.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass Authentication:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the affected devices and systems.
*   **Data Breach:**  Patient data stored on the system can be accessed, potentially leading to a privacy breach.
*   **System Compromise:** An attacker could potentially gain control of the system for further malicious actions.
*   **Modification of device parameters:** In the case of medical imaging equipment, configuration changes could lead to incorrect radiation dosage and patient harm

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely if the device is accessible over a network, or if they are on the hospital network.
*   **Internet Exposure:** The vulnerability can be exploited if the device is directly accessible from the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device.
*   **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker needs to be aware of the default or hard-coded credentials used by the device.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The exploit is considered easy to execute, requiring low skill from the attacker.
