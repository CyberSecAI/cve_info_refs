Advisory:          2004-betaNC-001
Affected Software: Nuke Cops betaNC PHP-Nuke Bundle w/ PHPNuke 6.5 and later
Affected Versions: all cvs versions
Main Developer:    Paul Laudanski
                   Computer Cops (<http://www.computercops.biz>)
                   NukeCops (<http://www.nukecops.com/>)
Module Developers: See credits section below

Description:
-----------

betaNC PHP-Nuke Bundle is a fork of PhpNuke which has been customized with
some additional functionality and corrective code to eliminate user reported
software bugs.  Created in mid-2003, this open source portal software is
maintained by the "official" PhpNuke developers at NukeCops
(<http://www.nukecops.com/>).

Vulnerability:
-------------

PhpNuke's software is a major component in this project thus it suffers
from the same security weakness as its parent.

In an effort to secure files from being directly accessed by outside visitors,
developers added a simple security checking mechanism.  If the checker
evaluates to false, the remaining code inside the file is executed.  If it
evaluates to true, the script aborts or the visitor is redirected to another
page.

The process consists of capturing the currently executing script's path and
filename with the global variable $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'].  Using PHP's built-in
function eregi(), this value is then compared against the script's name
which should be the sole access point.

Example:
if (!eregi("admin.php", $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'])) { die ("Access Denied"); }

In this example, a file with the above snippet will continue executing if
it was accessed by another file containing the letters "admin.php" (without
quotes) otherwise the script aborts returning the words "Access Denied".

Using eregi() with the NOT logical operator as done by the developers
is a very poor way to control file access because anyone can easily
manipulate a URL and add the missing component thereby forcing the security
check to always evaluate to false and gain unfettered entry.

Exploitation Example:
---------------------

<http://www.domain.com/admin/modules/blocks.php/admin.php>

Impact:
------

In the majority of cases here, exploition of this vulnerability will display
full path disclosure and not continue further code execution where intrusion
or damage might occur.  In a much smaller number of cases, the code may
continue executing and possibly allow outsiders unwanted access to some
restricted areas on the site.  Those who have setup their servers to look in
the main directory when a file is not located in the current one may see
a higher percentage of unwanted access and a lower percentage of full path
disclosures than others.

betaNC's code was not analyzed on whether additional vulnerabilities are
possible due to this security weakness.  However, files where potential SQL
injections might occur are flagged below.

Affected Files:
--------------
Although an effort was made to identify all affected files (~160 total of
which ~28 have no security check), we leave it up to the developers/users
to do their own verification to ensure no files were inadvertently missed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I reported their use of eregi() WITH the NOT logical operator AGAINST \
$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] is the problem not eregi() by itself

I agree using $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] is one way to fix it IF this element is \
available on the server.  Since the manual says, "you may or may not find any of the \
following elements in $_SERVER," IMO it's safer to secure a file by checking whether \
a CONSTANT, which is defined in the calling script, exists in the called one.
