  "cve": "CVE-2004-2760",
  "description": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in OpenSSH related to password prompts. Specifically, the issue stems from the interaction between PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) and password authentication, where multiple password prompts are presented to the user, leading to a potential denial-of-service or brute-forcing vulnerability.",
  "affected_software": {
    "name": "OpenSSH",
      "versions": "Older versions of OpenSSH prior to the fix."
  },
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the interaction between PAM and password authentication within OpenSSH. When both keyboard-interactive and password authentication methods are enabled, users receive multiple password prompts. The initial prompts are managed by PAM, while subsequent prompts are managed directly by OpenSSH's password authentication mechanism. If the user fails to authenticate during the PAM prompts, the connection is closed, but the password authentication still takes over, and it can be exploited to repeatedly try login.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Multiple password prompts",
        "Potential for brute force attacks due to repeated password prompts.",
        "Incorrect handling of authentication failures between PAM and password methods."
    ],
    "impact": {
      "denial_of_service": "A potential denial-of-service could occur by exhausting resources due to numerous authentication attempts.",
      "brute_force_attack": "The vulnerability could be exploited for brute-force attacks to discover user passwords.",
        "system_logging": "Failed attempts will fill the target system logs with sshd warnings."
    },
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote attacks via SSH connections.",
        "Brute-force attempts using scripts or tools to exploit repeated authentication prompts."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system running the vulnerable OpenSSH service and requires ability to make multiple connections to the SSH port.",

    "additional_notes": {
        "fixed_version_details": "The bug was fixed in more recent versions of OpenSSH, notably in OpenSSH 3.8p1 or later.",
        "workarounds": [
        "Disable keyboard-interactive authentication if not needed.",
          "Upgrade to a patched version of OpenSSH.",
          "Enforce robust password policies."
    ],
        "freebsd_note": "Older versions of FreeBSD-STABLE were affected because they were using old OpenSSH versions to maintain Kerberos 4 support.",
