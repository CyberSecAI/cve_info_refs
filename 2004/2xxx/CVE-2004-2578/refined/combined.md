It provides a Web-based calendar, todo-list, addressbook, email, news headlines, and a file manager. The calendar supports repeating events. The email system supports inline graphics and file attachments.

The system as a whole supports user preferences, themes, user permissions, multi-language support, an advanced API, and user groups.

## phpGroupWare.org has been relocated

*Submitted by 'skwashd' 07-Aug-2004 - 03:56 pm*

phpGroupWare.org is now at its new home. Sorry about the downtime, which was caused by some confusing over dates and timezones.

Our new host is [Northern Indiana Educational Services Center](http://web.archive.org/web/20040920024328/http%3A//niesc.k12.in.us/). NIESC is not a general host so we can't recommend that you all move your hosting over to them, but the project is greatful for their support.

## 0.9.16.002 Security Fix Release

*Submitted by 'skwashd' 27-Jul-2004 - 03:17 am*

All phpGroupWare versions earlier than 0.9.16.002 set header admin and setup passwords as plain text cookies. This release fixes this security problem.

The project considers the potential to exploit this flaw to be relatively minor.

Latest version are available at [download.phpgroupware.org/now](http://web.archive.org/web/20040920024328/http%3A//download.phpgroupware.org/now)

All users are encouraged to upgrade asap

## phpgroupware.org needs a new home

*Submitted by 'skwashd' 24-Jul-2004 - 03:27 pm*

Our happy little box which hosts phpgroupware.org, which is officially owned by the Free Software Foundation, needs a new home.

Currently the box is being hosted free of charge in a data center in Arizona. The person who arranged this for us no longer works for the company, and has been unable to arrange ongoing hosting with this company.

We did have an offer for free hosting for the box, but that has fallen through. We have 2 weeks to shift the box.

We want to keep the box, as there has been a lot of time invested in getting it setup the way we like. What we need is a data center to throw it in. I see two options:

* We find someone to donate 4U of rack space and bandwidth.
* We find a DC which provides reasonable rates for 4U of rackspace and bandwidth. We then find someone (or a group of people/companies) to pay the monthly fees.

The DC would preferably be in the US (the closer to Arizona the better).

If you can help us out, please [email Dave Hall](http://web.archive.org/web/20040920024328/mailto%3Askwashd%40phpgroupware.org) to discuss it further. Anyone who can assist with this will get a listing in [our sponsors hall of fame](http://web.archive.org/web/20040920024328/http%3A//phpgroupware.org/sponsors).

Cheers

**EDIT:** We have now found a new home for phpGroupWare.org, thanks to everyone who offer to help

## phpGroupWare 0.9.16.001 - bug fix release - is out!

*Submitted by 'skwashd' 17-Jul-2004 - 03:47 pm*

The 0.9.16.001 release includes:

* many fixes to the contacts backend
* improved LDAP support
* register\_globals = off fixes
* over 200 other bugs fixed

0.9.16.001 is likely to be the last 16 branch release, as most of the development effort moves to 0.9.18 which we hope will be released by the end of the year.

The release is available at [download.phpgroupware.org/now](http://web.archive.org/web/20040920024328/http%3A//download.phpgroupware.org/now).

## phpGroupWare.org gets a new look

*Submitted by 'skwashd' 12-Jul-2004 - 05:38 am*

As you might have noticed, phpgroupware.org (and its subdomains) have had a facelift.

Some of the content has been rearranged too - time to update your bookmarks.

The redesign was done by Dave Hall (aka skwashd), with feedback and assistance from many. The help was greatly appreciated.

The new site uses XHTML and CSS, with no javascript. For [mozilla firefox](http://web.archive.org/web/20040920024328/http%3A//mozilla.org/firefox/) users there are multiple stylesheets available. The new layout will help us with many proposals, watch this space.

Any comments are welcome.

Cheers
