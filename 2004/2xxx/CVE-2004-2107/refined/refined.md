    "ID": "CVE-2004-2107",
    "content": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in Finjan SurfinGate versions 6 and 7, where crafted requests sent to the proxy can mimic control commands due to lack of authentication on the control port (TCP/3141). This allows an attacker to issue commands such as restarting the service, viewing log data, and potentially modifying filtering policies. \n\nRoot cause:\nThe vulnerability is caused by the lack of authentication on the control port (TCP/3141), which allows any source to send commands to the Finjan SurfinGate server. The FHTTP protocol, used for control commands, doesn't verify the origin of commands, resulting in unauthorized access.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities: \n- Lack of authentication on the control port (TCP/3141) used for FHTTP protocol.\n- Unprotected FHTTP commands, allowing execution from any source including the local HTTP proxy.\n- The 'finjan-parameter-type' parameter acts as a command without verification.\n\nImpact of exploitation: \n- Denial of Service (DoS) by restarting the service using 'restart' command.\n- Information disclosure by viewing log data via 'getlastmsg' command.\n- Potential modification of filtering policies, though not confirmed.\n- Forced policy update from the database server using the 'online' command\n\nAttack vectors: \n- Sending crafted HTTP requests to the proxy mimicking control commands.\n- Exploiting the FHTTP protocol on the control port (TCP/3141).\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: \n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the proxy server.\n- No authentication is needed to send commands."
