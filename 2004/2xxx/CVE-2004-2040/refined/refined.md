Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in e107 version 0.615 as described in the provided advisories:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities stems from a combination of insecure coding practices, lack of input sanitization, and reliance on potentially unsafe PHP configurations within the e107 CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The advisories identify multiple vulnerabilities:

*   **A - Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Weakness:** Direct access to plugin PHP scripts reveals the server's full file path when standard PHP errors occur.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Information disclosure.
*   **B - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Weakness:** Input fields in various parts of the application (clock menu, email article, submit news, user settings) don't properly sanitize user input, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
    *   **Vulnerability:** XSS attacks can be used to steal cookies, read cross-domain forms, and potentially lead to account compromise.
*   **C - Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**
    *   **Weakness:** The `secure_img_render.php` script is vulnerable to remote file inclusion when `allow_url_fopen` is enabled.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Attackers can force the server to execute malicious PHP code from a remote server, potentially leading to shell-level access. This is dependent on the `register_globals` setting being enabled.
*   **D - SQL Injection:**
    *   **Weakness:**  The `content.php` and `news.php` scripts do not properly sanitize input parameters, making them susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames and password hashes, potentially leading to complete website compromise. The `UNION` clause is used in the described attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities varies:

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** Reveals server's directory structure, which may assist in further attacks.
*   **XSS:** Can lead to cookie theft, reading cross-domain forms, and account takeover.
*   **RFI:** Can lead to remote code execution, potentially gaining shell-level access to the server.
*  **SQL Injection:** Allows attackers to read or modify sensitive database information, including user credentials, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** Direct HTTP GET requests to vulnerable script files.
*   **XSS:**
    *   Directly crafted URLs with malicious javascript payloads in parameters of vulnerable scripts.
    *   Malicious input in forms such as "email article to friend," "submit news," and "user settings."
*   **RFI:** Crafted HTTP GET request to  `secure_img_render.php` with the `p` parameter pointing to a malicious remote file.
*   **SQL Injection:** Crafted HTTP GET requests to vulnerable scripts (`content.php` and `news.php`) containing malicious SQL payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** No special privileges required, an attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application.
*   **XSS:** No special privileges are needed, however, for some XSS attacks, the attacker needs to be logged off or logged in.
*   **RFI:** The attacker needs access to the vulnerable web application, `allow_url_fopen` has to be turned on in php configuration and `register_globals` must be set to "on" .
*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs access to the vulnerable web application. The mysql server must be 4.x with enabled UNION functionality.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisories strongly suggest upgrading to e107 version 0.616, which is said to contain patches for these vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerabilities were reported by Janek Vind "waraxe."
*  The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, including specific vulnerable files and example attack URLs.
* The advisory notes that certain server configurations such as `register_globals=on`, `allow_url_fopen=on` and mysql version 4.x with enabled UNION clause are required for the exploit of certain vulnerabilities.

This detailed information is valuable for understanding the specific nature of the vulnerabilities in e107 v0.615, how they can be exploited, and how to mitigate them.
