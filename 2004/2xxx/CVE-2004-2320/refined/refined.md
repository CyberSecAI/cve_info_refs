Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in VU#867593, which is related to the HTTP TRACE method and corresponds to CVE-2004-2320:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the default enablement of the HTTP TRACE method in web servers. This method, designed for debugging, echoes the client's HTTP request back to the client, including sensitive headers like cookies and authentication data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTTP TRACE Method Enabled by Default:** Web servers have the TRACE method enabled, which is not necessary for normal operation.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The TRACE method exposes sensitive information present in HTTP headers, including cookies and authentication credentials, which are meant to be kept confidential.
*   **Cross-Site Tracing (XST):** When combined with cross-domain vulnerabilities in web browsers, the TRACE method can be leveraged by attackers to perform cross-site tracing, allowing them to access sensitive header information from third-party domains.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Theft:** Attackers can steal cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** By accessing authentication data, attackers can impersonate legitimate users.
*   **Information Leakage:** Sensitive information within HTTP headers can be exposed to malicious actors.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Client-Side Scripting:** Attackers can use client-side scripting (e.g., JavaScript) with tools like XMLHTTP to initiate TRACE requests to a vulnerable web server.
*   **Cross-Domain Vulnerabilities:**  Attackers combine this with cross-site scripting vulnerabilities (XSS) in web browsers to steal cookies from third-party domains.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** Although not explicitly detailed, a man-in-the-middle attacker could also use this to view the headers in a trace request, if they can intercept and modify the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject Client-Side Code:** The attacker must be able to inject JavaScript or other client-side scripts on a web page to initiate TRACE requests.
*   **Target a Vulnerable Server:** The targeted web server must have the HTTP TRACE method enabled.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Browsers (for XST):** For Cross-Site Tracing attacks, the attacker needs to target browsers that have cross-domain vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability can bypass the `HttpOnly` cookie attribute which is designed to prevent script access to cookies.
*   The report mentions specific technologies like XMLHTTP ActiveX and XMLDOM scripting objects that can be used to make TRACE requests.
*   The report specifically names Jeremiah Grossman of WhiteHat Security as the researcher who discovered and reported the issue.
*   The provided content provides mitigation guidance for Apache HTTP Server and Microsoft IIS using `TraceEnable Off` and URLScan tool respectively, to disable the TRACE method.
