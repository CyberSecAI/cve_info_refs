Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.6.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

* **001: RELIABILITY FIX: November 10, 2004**
    *All architectures*

  Fix detection of tape blocksize during device open. Corrects problem with
  [restore(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.6/restore.8).

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.6/common/001_st.patch)

  * **002: RELIABILITY FIX: November 10, 2004**
      *All architectures*

    BIND contains a bug which results in BIND trying to contact nameservers via IPv6, even in
    cases where IPv6 connectivity is non-existent. This results in unnecessary timeouts and
    thus slow DNS queries.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.6/common/002_bind.patch)

    * **003: RELIABILITY FIX: November 10, 2004**
        *All architectures*

      [pppd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.6/pppd.8)
      contains a bug that allows an attacker to crash his own connection, but it cannot
      be used to deny service to other users.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.6/common/003_pppd.patch)

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: November 10, 2004**
          *All architectures*

        Due to a bug in
        [lynx(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.6/lynx.1)
        it is possible for pages such as
        [this](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/mangleme/gallery/lynx_die1.html)
        to cause
        [lynx(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.6/lynx.1)
        to exhaust memory and then crash when parsing such pages.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.6/common/004_lynx.patch)

        * **005: RELIABILITY FIX: November 21, 2004**
            *All architectures*

          Wrong calculation of NAT-D payloads may cause interoperability problems between
          [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.6/isakmpd.8)
          and other ISAKMP/IKE implementations.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.6/common/005_isakmpd.patch)

          * **006: RELIABILITY FIX: November 21, 2004**
              *All architectures*

            Fix for transmit side breakage on macppc and mbuf leaks with
            [xl(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.6/xl.4).

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.6/common/006_xl.patch)

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: December 14, 2004**
                *All architectures*

              On systems running
              [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.6/isakmpd.8)
              it is possible for a local user to cause kernel memory corruption
              and system panic by setting
              [ipsec(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.6/ipsec.4)
              credentials on a socket.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.6/common/007_pfkey.patch)

              * **008: RELIABILITY FIX: January 6, 2005**
                  *All architectures*

                The
                [getcwd(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.6/getcwd.3)
                library function contains a memory management error, which causes failure
                to retrieve the current working directory if the path is very long.

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.6/common/008_getcwd.patch)

                * **009: SECURITY FIX: January 12, 2005**
                    *All architectures*

                  [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.6/httpd.8)
                  's mod\_include module fails to properly validate the length of
                  user supplied tag strings prior to copying them to a local buffer,
                  causing a buffer overflow.

                  This would require enabling the XBitHack directive or server-side
                  includes and making use of a malicious document.

                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.6/common/009_httpd.patch)

                  * **010: RELIABILITY FIX: January 11, 2005**
                      *All architectures*

                    A bug in the
                    [tcp(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.6/tcp.4)
                    stack allows an invalid argument to be used in calculating the TCP
                    retransmit timeout. By sending packets with specific values in the TCP
                    timestamp option, an attacker can cause a system panic.

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.6/common/010_rtt.patch)

                    * **011: SECURITY FIX: February 28, 2005**
                        *i386 only*

                      More stringent checking should be done in the
                      [copy(9)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.6/copy.9)
                      functions to prevent their misuse.

                      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.6/i386/011_locore.patch)

                      * **012: SECURITY FIX: March 16, 2005**
                          *amd64 only*

                        More stringent checking should be done in the
                        [copy(9)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.6/copy.9)
                        functions to prevent their misuse.

                        * **013: RELIABILITY FIX: March 30, 2005**
                            *All architectures*

                          Bugs in the
                          [tcp(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.6/tcp.4)
                          stack can lead to memory exhaustion or processing of TCP segments with
                          invalid SACK options and cause a system crash.

                          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.6/common/013_sack.patch)

                          * **014: SECURITY FIX: March 30, 2005**
                              *All architectures*

                            Due to buffer overflows in
                            [telnet(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.6/telnet.1),
                            a malicious server or man-in-the-middle attack could allow execution of
                            arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
                            [telnet(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.6/telnet.1).
                            Noone should use telnet anymore. Please use
                            [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.6/ssh.1).

                                  As discovered by Stefan Miltchev calling

                                      *All architectures*

                                    Due to a race condition in its command pathname handling, a user with
                                    [sudo(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.6/sudo.8)
                                    privileges may be able to run arbitrary commands if the user's entry
                                    is followed by an entry that grants `sudo ALL` privileges to
                                    another user.

                                        Please note that this fixes a different buffer overflow than the [previous](#libz) zlib patch.
