  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2004-2632",
      "description": "phpMyAdmin is vulnerable to PHP code injection. By crafting a table name with malicious meta-characters, a remote attacker can inject and execute arbitrary PHP code via the eval() function in left.php. This is only exploitable if the $cfg['LeftFrameLight'] variable is set to FALSE.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper handling of single quotes when constructing the eval() string, allowing for injection of arbitrary PHP code through a crafted table name. Additionally, the application allows an attacker to modify the server configuration variables via GET requests, allowing them to connect to a malicious MySQL server.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation of table names leading to code injection.",
        "Insecure use of eval() function.",
         "Ability to grow up array variables by way of GET params",
         "Lack of sanitization of server configuration variables received via GET requests."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code with the privileges of the webserver, potentially leading to a denial of service or further compromise of the system.",
      "attack_vector": "Remote exploitation via crafted GET request to left.php.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs a valid user account and be able to connect to a malicious MySQL server they control. This requires a specially modified MySQL server, or a wrapper to intercept and return fake table names containing malicious php code."
