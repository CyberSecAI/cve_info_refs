| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=126940#c0)  SEKINE Tatsuo    2004-06-29 15:01:59 UTC  ``` From Bugzilla Helper: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040510  Description of problem: /usr/bin/im-switch program use file "/tmp/imswitcher$$" as temporary file.  This way to use temporary file is insecure, because /tmp/ is everyone writable and $$(PID) is predictable.  When root try to set system-wide setting of IM, attacker can crash  important file without root privilege.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): iiimf-x-11.4-46.svn1587  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. an attacker who has onlu normal privilege types as followed:    $ bash -c 'i=1;while [ $i -lt 65536 ]; do ln -s /etc/IMPORTANT_FILE /tmp/imswitcher$i; let "i++"; done'  2. root types below to set system-wide IM setting:    # /usr/bin/im-switch -w -m xim  3.       Actual Results:  /etc/IMPORTANT_FILE becomes broken.   Expected Results:  /etc/IMPORTANT_FILE is independent from the behavior of im-switch program.   Additional info:  mktemp(1) command or "umask 077; mkdir /tmp/..." should be used to make temporary file(directory).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=126940#c1)  Jens Petersen    2004-07-05 11:36:35 UTC  ``` Thanks for spotting this - should get fixed in an update soon.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=126940#c2)  Jens Petersen    2004-07-06 07:13:48 UTC  ``` im-sdk-11.4-46.1 has been built to address this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=126940#c3)  Lawrence Lim    2004-07-07 04:16:56 UTC  ``` Great efforts guys.  Performed sanity check and verified that the tmp file imswitcher$$ no longer exist in the dir after using im-swicth command.   ``` |  |
