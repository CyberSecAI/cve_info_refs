Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the Slashdot article:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Netgear WG602v1 router had a hidden backdoor account built into its firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hardcoded backdoor account:** The router firmware included a hardcoded "super" user account with a default password, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Insecure "fix":** Instead of removing the backdoor, Netgear simply changed the username and password in a firmware update, leaving the backdoor mechanism intact. The new credentials ("superman" and "21241036") were also easily discovered.
- **Lack of proper security practices:** The initial vulnerability was a result of poor security practices and the "fix" shows a lack of understanding of security principles.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized access:** Attackers could use the backdoor account to gain unauthorized administrative access to the router.
- **Network compromise:** With administrative access, attackers could potentially:
    - Change router settings
    - Monitor network traffic
    - Redirect users to malicious sites
    - Launch attacks on other devices within the network
    - Use the router as a launching point for attacks on other systems

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network access:** The attack vector is via the network interface, which can be either from the internal network or, potentially, from the internet if remote administration was enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic technical knowledge:** Attackers need only to know the backdoor credentials (easily obtainable) and understand how to connect to the router's administration interface (usually a web interface).
- **Network connectivity:** Attackers need to be on the same network as the vulnerable router, or able to access it remotely, if remote administration is enabled.

**Additional Notes:**
- The slashdot discussion highlights the community's disappointment and outrage, as Netgear's "fix" was deemed wholly inadequate and an insult to user's intelligence.
- Some commenters suggested ways to circumvent the inadequate "fix," such as binary editing the firmware to change the hardcoded credentials.
- The Slashdot comments indicate that this was not the first time Netgear had made such a blunder and that there was previous issue about their devices flooding NTP time servers.
- The Slashdot comments also mention that Allied Telesyn has a similar practice with hardcoded backdoor passwords.

This information provides more detail about the root cause, weaknesses and impact of the vulnerability than the generic CVE description, highlighting the poor security practices of Netgear and the potential danger this posed to its users.
