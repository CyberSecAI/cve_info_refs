**Vulnerability Overview**

The initial message identifies several scripts in SuSE Linux 9.0 that are potentially vulnerable to symlink attacks. These scripts create temporary files in shared locations like `/tmp` using predictable names. An attacker could potentially create a symbolic link with the same name before the script executes, causing the script to write to an attacker-controlled file location.

**Vulnerable Scripts and Details**

*   **`/usr/X11R6/bin/fvwm-bug`**:
    *   **Weakness:** Creates a temporary file in `/tmp` using a predictable name: `TEMP=/tmp/fvwm-bug.$$`
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could create a symlink named `/tmp/fvwm-bug.<pid>` before the script runs. When the script attempts to write to this location, it will write to the target of the symlink, which is controlled by the attacker.
*   **`/usr/X11R6/bin/wm-oldmenu2new`**:
    *   **Weakness:** Creates a temporary file in `/tmp` using a predictable name `T=/tmp/wmmenu$$`
    *   **Attack Vector:** Similar to the above, an attacker could create a symlink named `/tmp/wmmenu<pid>-c`. When the script copies data to this location, it would copy to the attacker's chosen location via the symlink.
*   **`/usr/X11R6/bin/x11perfcomp`**:
    *   **Weakness:** Creates a temporary directory using a predictable name in either `/tmp` or the directory specified by `$TMPDIR`, `tmp=${TMPDIR-/tmp}/rates.$$`, then a subdirectory `rates` inside that and later copies a file into a subdirectory `labels`.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could create a symlink with the name `$TMPDIR/rates.<pid>` pointing to a location outside the intended temp directory before the script creates the directory. The mkdir will fail, but if the attacker creates the `rates` subdirectory of the symlink, the script will copy to the location via the symlink which may also contain the `labels` subdirectory in attacker controlled location.
*   **`/usr/X11R6/bin/xf86debug`**:
     *  **Weakness**: Redirects the output of `gdb` to `/tmp/xf86debug.1.log`
     * **Attack Vector:** An attacker could create `/tmp/xf86debug.1.log` as a symlink before the script executes, causing the output to be redirected to a file controlled by the attacker.
*   **`/opt/kde3/bin/winpopup-send.sh`**:
    *   **Weakness:** Creates a temporary file `/tmp/.winpopup-new` and renames it to `/tmp/.winpopup`.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could create `/tmp/.winpopup` as a symlink before the script executes. When the script performs the rename operation `mv -f /tmp/.winpopup-new /tmp/.winpopup`, it will overwrite the attacker-controlled file at the symlink target with the content of `/tmp/.winpopup-new`.
*   **`/sbin/lvmcreate_initrd`**:
    *   **Weakness:** Creates a temporary file in `/tmp` with predictable name using `DEVRAM=/tmp/initrd.$$`
    *   **Attack Vector**: Similar to above cases, an attacker could create a symlink named `/tmp/initrd.<pid>` which would cause `dd` to write the contents to the symlink destination.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the use of predictable temporary file and directory names within shared locations (primarily `/tmp`). This allows an attacker to race the legitimate script and create a symbolic link with the same name, redirecting file operations to a location of the attacker's choosing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:

*   Overwrite arbitrary files on the system if the script writes to the temp file
*   Potentially gain elevated privileges if the replaced files are executed by a privileged user or process.
*   Cause denial of service by overwriting configuration files or log files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have local access to the system to create symlinks in `/tmp` or specified by the `$TMPDIR` variable.
*   The attacker needs to be able to predict the process ID (or a range of them), since it's part of the temp file name.
*   The attacker needs to race the script to create the symlink before the script creates the file or directory.

**Additional Notes**

The second message indicates that the SUSE security team was notified of the vulnerability and will fix the reported bugs. It also indicates that it is preferable to report security issues to the security team first before making them public.
