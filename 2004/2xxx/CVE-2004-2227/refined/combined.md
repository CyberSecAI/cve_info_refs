how do you envision diabling the OK button? how do we determine what is and
isn't a spoofed filename?
also, I don't know what font sizes you're seeing, but the number of spaces there
aren't big enough. But its still possible somewhat to spoof. Although, maybe
it would be possible to forcewrap the text, if there's a way I have another bug

The idea of disabling de OK button is to force the user to make the decision of
choosing the application, to make responsible him.
I understand we cannot determine what is and isn't a spoofed filename, I just
see it like another barrier of security.
The URL example its a case test only, add some spaces or/and increase de font
and you possible have a spoofed name.
About the wrapping thing I saw Mozilla Suite 1.6 do that in the same case.

I don't think this a vaild problem for three reasons:
1. The name can be scrolled by clicking and moving the mouse (a poor reason I know).
2. Firefox says " ... which is a
{3050F4D8-98B5-11CF-BB82-00AA00BDCE0B}SECUNIA\_INTERNET\_EXPLORER%2EPDF file.
Which is obviously not the pdf file its trying to spoof as.
3. Firefox shows no programs to open it with because it does not know what sort
of file it is and defaults to "save".
I recommend resolving this invaild.

IMO, this is a valid security hole. You only have to successfully spoof an
extension in one place to get most advanced Windows users to use Windows
Explorer's "Open" command, which opens documents and launches executables.

I think the bug here is that Firefox offers to open a file when it does not know
the filetype (and hence does not know what to open it with). This should
probably be filed as a seperate bug anyway if it does not already exist. If the
file happens to be an exe file with the name spoofed as shown with loads of
spaces then Firefox already says this is a file of type executable (and as far
as I remember won't offer to open it).
If you still insist the original bug is valid then perhaps the following
approach could be used:
If a name contains more than one consecutive space then shorten these to only
one space. I can't see this breaking anything and it resolves the spoofing problem.

this would be nice to handle in some way, its valid since a well-behaved browser
should be able to recognize spoofy filenames and guard unwary users against
that, but its not really a high priority to deal with.

That sounds to me like it would be the best way to solve this issue. Or, at
least show it with one space in the dialog (i.e. preserve the spaces when it's
saving it).

What's to stop someone from just using alt-0160 non-breaking spaces instead of
"real" spaces? I don't know if you can make Unicode characters show up in there,
but if so, you can do all sorts of mischief like Unicode spaces, sprinkling in
zero-width or invisible formatting characters, etc.

I am not entirely sure that this is a valid point, however I thought it should
be mentioned at least...
What if the spoofed file is not spoofed using space characters? Would it not be
possible to have a long file name where there are no, or only a single, space
character that could still trigger this issue?
For example would something like the following trigger this issue?
File\_\_Name\_\_Is\_\_Extremely\_\_Long\_\_Enough\_\_To\_\_Spoof\_\_\_.pdf.exe
I haven't tested it but it seems like, with a little more work, an attacker
could still easily trigger this issue even if the space characters are
trimmed... I think that wrapping the file name is the only real solution.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager).

### Background

Mozilla is a popular web browser that includes a mail and newsreader.
Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird are respectively the
next-generation browser and mail client from the Mozilla project.

### Description

Maurycy Prodeus from isec.pl found a potentially exploitable buffer
overflow in the handling of NNTP URLs. Furthermore, Martin (from
ptraced.net) discovered that temporary files in recent versions of
Mozilla-based products were sometimes stored world-readable with
predictable names. The Mozilla Team also fixed a way of spoofing
filenames in Firefox's "What should Firefox do with this file" dialog
boxes and a potential information leak about the existence of local
filenames.

### Impact

A remote attacker could craft a malicious NNTP link and entice a user
to click it, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code
with the rights of the user running the browser. A local attacker could
leverage the temporary file vulnerability to read the contents of
another user's attachments or downloads. A remote attacker could also
design a malicious web page that would allow to spoof filenames if the
user uses the "Open with..." function in Firefox, or retrieve
information on the presence of specific files in the local filesystem.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution
