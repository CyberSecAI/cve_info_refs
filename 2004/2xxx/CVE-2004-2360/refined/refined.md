- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The server attempts to read a data block repeatedly until it is fully received, leading to an infinite loop if the data is incomplete.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of incomplete data within a network function, resulting in a server freeze.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service (DoS) due to server freeze.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending incomplete data packets to the game server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker capable of sending crafted UDP packets to the server.
