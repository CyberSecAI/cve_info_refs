# Cscope: Many buffer overflows — GLSA **200606-10**

Cscope is vulnerable to multiple buffer overflows that could lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-util/cscope** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **15.5-r6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **15.5-r6** |

### Background

Cscope is a developer's tool for browsing source code.

### Description

Cscope does not verify the length of file names sourced in
#include statements.

### Impact

A user could be enticed to source a carefully crafted file which
will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the permissions
of the user running Cscope.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Cscope users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/cscope-15.5-r6"
```

Package        : cscope
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem-Type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2004-2541
Debian Bug     : 340177

Jason Duell discovered that cscope, a source code browsing tool, does not
verify the length of file names sourced in include statements, which may
potentially lead to the execution of arbitrary code through specially
crafted source code files.

For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 15.3-1woody3.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 15.5-1.1sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your cscope package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I traced it down in the Makefile to the "install_sax_driver" which makes it write into the main-systems perl dir.  I hacked around it with this:   src_install () {         export PERL5LIB=`perl -e 'print map { ":$ENV{D}/$_" } @INC'` #       try make PREFIX=${D}/usr INSTALLMAN3DIR=${D}/usr/share/man/man3 install # hack around the make install "make install_sax_driver" stage since it breaks things :/          try make PREFIX=${D}/usr INSTALLMAN3DIR=${D}/usr/share/man/man3 pure_install doc_install  #       perl -MXML::SAX -e "XML::SAX->add_parser(q(XML::LibXML::SAX::Parser))->save_parsers()"         dodoc MANIFEST README } pkg_postinst() {         perl -MXML::SAX -e "XML::SAX->add_parser(q(XML::LibXML::SAX::Parser))->save_parsers()" }                           ( the last line is taken from "install_sax_driver"  )  Could you please check/verify this before I commit a dumb hack?  (in your /etc/make.conf way down there to MAINTAINER="" add "sandbox" in that variable)     ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Carl-Christian Salvesen    2002-03-28 06:16:28 UTC  ``` Looks good and works for me.. ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Spider (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-28 08:30:24 UTC  ``` commited ``` |  |
