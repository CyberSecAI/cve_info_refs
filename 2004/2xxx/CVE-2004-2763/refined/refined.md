Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in VU#867593, which appears to be related to CVE-2004-2763 as both concern the HTTP TRACE method:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the default enablement of the HTTP TRACE method in web servers. This method echoes the client's request back in the response, including sensitive HTTP headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Enabled HTTP TRACE method:** Web servers by default often have the HTTP TRACE method enabled.
- **Information Leakage:** The TRACE method returns the full request, including HTTP headers, which may contain sensitive information like cookies and authentication data.
- **Cross-Site Tracing (XST):** When combined with cross-domain browser vulnerabilities, this method allows attackers to access sensitive headers from third-party domains by leveraging client-side scripting.
- **Bypassing HttpOnly Cookie Attribute:** Attackers can bypass the HttpOnly cookie attribute, which prevents script access to `document.cookie`, by reading the cookie from the HTTP TRACE response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information in HTTP headers, such as cookies and authentication data.
- **Session Hijacking:** By capturing authentication cookies, attackers could potentially hijack user sessions.
- **Bypassing Security Measures:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass security measures like HttpOnly cookies designed to prevent client-side script access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) combined with client-side HTTP requests:**  Attackers can leverage a malicious website to make TRACE requests to a vulnerable server via client-side scripting objects (e.g., XMLHTTP ActiveX or XMLDOM scripting objects).
- **Cross-domain attacks:** By exploiting cross-domain browser vulnerabilities, attackers can send TRACE requests to any domain that supports the HTTP TRACE method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to inject malicious client-side scripting into a website visited by the target user or to otherwise induce a user's browser to make TRACE requests.
- The target web server must have the HTTP TRACE method enabled.
- An understanding of how to use client-side scripting and the HTTP protocol.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is referred to as "Cross-Site Tracing" (XST).
- The provided document includes solutions for disabling the TRACE method in Apache and IIS.
- Several vendors were notified about the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability can bypass the `HttpOnly` cookie attribute.
- The issue was researched by Jeremiah Grossman of WhiteHat Security.
- The document lists several affected vendors including Apache, IBM, Lotus, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems.

**CVE ID Verification**
While the vulnerability note does not directly include a CVE ID, the description and details clearly align with the vulnerability that CVE-2004-2763 is associated with - the risk associated with the HTTP TRACE method.

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the vulnerability, its causes, impact, and potential attack vectors.
