Based on the id Software 3.21 source, rather than concentrate on fancy graphics, embedded MP3 players and other "gimmick" features, R1Q2 is focused on providing stability, security and speed.   ---   (2004-10-29) Note about secur1ty.net advisory: It seems a lot of server admins are switching to using R1Q2 as a result of my recent [advisory](//web.archive.org/web/20041130092749/http%3A//secur1ty.net/advisories/001). This is great! But please, if you have a problem with the server, [let me know](http://web.archive.org/web/20041130092749/http%3A//www.r1ch.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=8)! I hope to make R1Q2 the best available server binary for Quake II, and I can't do that without your help. Thanks.   ---   R1Q2 is still under active development. Client-side binaries available here are release snapshots and therefore may be unstable or contain broken/missing functionality. The server-side binaries (dedicated.exe, r1q2ded) are highly recommended however as they contain numerous security and performance improvements over standard Q2 and are very stable having been in production use since mid-2002.  You may also be interested in [R1GL](/web/20041130092749/http%3A//www.r1ch.net/stuff/r1gl/), an enhanced OpenGL renderer for Quake II with the same design goals as R1Q2.  R1Q2 Features:  * Security fixes to both client and server code to prevent crashes, buffer overflows, DoS attacks and other nasty things. All publically known bugs and exploits are patched in R1Q2. * Stability improvements - some public R1Q2 servers have been up for over 150 days. Additional sanity checks are added for Game DLLs so a buggy mod has less chance of taking the whole server down. * Speed increases thanks to file system caches, removal of redundant code and a streamlined dedicated-only binary for servers. * Enhanced netcode - support for text message queues, zlib compressed packets and various other bandwidth-saving improvements. Even non-R1Q2 clients will benefit from some of the changes! R1Q2 clients also benefit from faster connection times, reduced outgoing bandwidth usage and other nice features. * Separation of renderer and network code in the client - no longer are you forced to run at 30 FPS to avoid flooding your modem! R1Q2 uses cl\_maxfps control your network packet rate whilst the renderer still runs at full speed. * High compatibility - R1Q2 clients can connect to any normal Q2 server and normal Q2 clients can connect to an R1Q2 server. The game DLL and renderer DLL APIs remain unchanged too. * Highly configurable server settings - lots of new sv\_ cvars to configure your server how you want it. * Improved anti-cheat measures for servers. Client packets are inspected for values that a normal Quake II client would never send and speedbot prevention/detection is improved. Please note that R1Q2 is not designed to be an anti-cheat solution. * Hundreds of other small fixes, improvements, speedups that are too numerous to list here.  First time user? Grab the [updater](download/R1Q2Updater.zip), [R1Q2](download/r1q2.zip) and extract all files to your Quake 2 directory. Run R1Q2Updater.exe to get the latest version. You can now run R1Q2 just the same as if you were running quake2.exe but please see below for important notes about the client. Downloads Win32 Auto Updater **Highly recommended**! Extract this file into your Quake 2 directory and run it periodically to update your R1Q2 binaries to the latest release. ([R1Q2Updater.zip](download/R1Q2Updater.zip), 112 KiB)  Win32 Client/Server A combined client/server executable. Be sure to use the auto updater above after installing to obtain the latest version. Extract to your Quake II directory and use it as if it were quake2.exe. ([r1q2.zip](download/r1q2.zip), 266 KiB)  Win32 Dedicated Server A dedicated only binary with no client. Be sure to use the auto updater above after installing to obtain the latest version. Simply download and extract to your Quake II directory and use it as if it were a normal Quake II. ([dedicated.zip](download/dedicated.zip), 126 KiB)  GNU/Linux GlibC 2.x Dedicated Server (FOR NEW MODS) A dedicated only binary with no client. Very stable and secure, highly recommended for anyone running a GNU/Linux Quake II server. This binary was compiled with GlibC 2.1 with GCC 2.95.3 and is designed for running mods that are built with a modern compiler/glibc version such as Gloom. If you encounter a Segmentation Fault either while loading the server or immediately after joining, please use the version below. ([r1q2ded.zip](download/r1q2ded.zip), 191 KiB)  GNU/Linux GlibC 2.x Dedicated Server (FOR OLD MODS) As above, but this binary is designed for running old mods such as Jailbreak, OSP and the original Quake 2 DM that have binary-incompatible versions of gamei386.so. This binary was compiled with GlibC 2.1 with GCC 2.7.2. ([r1q2ded-old.zip](download/r1q2ded-old.zip), 178 KiB)  GNU/Linux Auto Updater (0.0.3) If you run a GNU/Linux R1Q2 server keep it up to date with this statically linked updater. To use, just extract to your Q2 directory and periodically run it from time to time. ([r1q2updater.zip](download/r1q2updater.zip), 663 KiB)  Source Code This directory contains source code to all released versions of R1Q2. A Linux Makefile is included. Please note that if you choose to compile your own binary, you must use GCC 2.7.2 to maintain compatibility with old mods. A FreeBSD compatible Makefile and source files are planned for the next release. ([source code](src/)) Important Information Clients should set their cl\_maxfps value to the amount of packets per second that they wish to send. It is highly recommended that it not be set higher than 30 to preserve server bandwidth and CPU time.  Some servers running Q2Admin may kick you for using R1Q2 as Q2Admin erroneously detects a "client side proxy". Please contact the admin of the server and ask them to disable the detection/kick features of Q2Admin as they offer no protection against hacked clients now that the Q2 source is out and cause numerous false positives. The latest release of the R1Q2 client has a fix for this problem, please update if you are getting kicked.  If you encounter a bug or R1Q2 crashes, please post details in the [R1Q2 forum](http://web.archive.org/web/20041130092749/http%3A//www.r1ch.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=8). You can also find some little snippets of documentation on the forum. | |
