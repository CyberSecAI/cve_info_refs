How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| 1.0e | 29th August 2003 | This version Fixes the following reported security issues:  **http://www.secunia.com/advisories/9483/** 1) It is possible to cause the server to crash by requesting a long URL. 2) Usernames and passwords are stored in clear text in "surgeldap\user.dat". 3) The installation path is revealed if a non-existant file is requested. 4) The "cmd" parameter isn't properly verified in the "user.cgi" script, which allows trivial Cross Site Scripting attacks.  **http://www.securiteam.com/windowsntfocus/5RP0I0UAUI.html** 1) Disclosing the full path of the SurgeLDAP Server installation directory 2) CSS (Cross Site Scripting) 3) Denial of service 4) Clear text password storage  **http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/12899 http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/12901 http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/12902 http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/12904**SurgeLDAP nonexistent file path disclosure SurgeLDAP CGI scripts cross-site scripting SurgeLDAP HTTP GET buffer overflow SurgeLDAP users.dat file plaintext password  **http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/8406 http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/8407 http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/8408** **http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/8409**SurgeLDAP Path Disclosure Vulnerability SurgeLDAP User.CGI Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability  SurgeLDAP HTTP GET Denial Of Service Vulnerability SurgeLDAP Insecure Password Storage Vulnerability   * Fixed: Server crashing for large URL request * Updated: Any invalid URL's default to index.htm * Update: Stop the full path being display for a request for an invalid   html page. * Update: Invalid 'cmd=..' now default to the top page of the CGI.                admin.cgi   -- Login page.                user.cgi   -- Login as guest * Added: User.dat passwords are now encoded using {ssha}. You can still   edit the user.dat and enter plain text passwords but SurgeLDAP will   encode then next time it starts. * Added: Modules can be setup to only allow stated IP's   *Layout:* module type listern\_IP listern\_port timeout max\_cur\_con   [mod\_id [allowed\_ips]] * Added: New Schema data:                 IPObject   (class)                entryIP   (Field)   If an object is build from 'IPObject' the IP address that made the connection   will be saved as part of the object. * Added: Extra Module security to help against password checks and denial   of service attacks.   1) Limit Concurrent Connections per ip.   2) Setting to 'ignore' requests if they excceed a certain rate per ip   per time.   3) Password Guessing is limited (limit guesses per ip per time) max\_ip\_connection mod\_id number   max\_ip\_rate mod\_id number timeframe blocktime   max\_pass\_guess mod\_id number timeframe blocktime |
| 1.0d | 20th June 2003 | * Fixed: NetMeeting issues on Solaris system * Update: Database Storage Layout. * Update Installer: The installer will automatically update database   versions. * Update: Updated NetMeeting schema to support 'Portrait'   As well as the netmeeting convertion program. * Added: Paswords that are: {crypt}, {SSHA}, {SHA} encoded. * Added: Backup and Replocating of SurgeLDAP to another SurgeLDAP server.   ([see manual](admin.htm)) |
| 1.0b | 12th March 2003 | * Fixed: When using IE on the user interface when you add or deleted   a item to the database the menu list ot the left was not updating automatically.   This issue did not occur in Netscape. * Fixed: Sucking from other LDAP server which limited the amount of   data it provided, to atleast add the data that it did provide. Sucking   now also optionally does the entire tree from the base location, or   just 1 level. Also attempts to add the base object.  * Added: SurgeLDAP has been updated (server and admin templates) to   allow 'LDIF' files to be user to enter data to the database.admin/suck.tpl * Added: Added new command prompt to import ldiff files.   ./surgeldap -import test.ldiff * Added: Dynamic Records. Records that are defined using the objectClass:   dynamicObject are automaticaly given a time out depending on the following   ini setting:      dynamic\_subtrees "<wilddn>" <basetime> If the dn does not match then the object is NOT setup as a dynamic   record.   Once the time has run out then the record is then removed from the   data base.  The time is reset in the following ways:   1. The record is modified.   2. When the atttribute: 'entryTtl' is requested. * Added: Shell Command. SurgeLDAP now supports shell commands where   selected commands on selected domains cause an external program to be   run with the command which can modify the command, It can either return   back the modified command or tell SurgeLDAP that it was successfull.   The ini setting for this is: shell id "wild\_dn" "cmd=file\_to\_run" flags       | **'cmd' can be:** | search, add, modify, delete, modrn, check |   | --- | --- |   | **'flags' can be:** | NONE - No extra action LDAP - The 'file\_to\_run' is the LDAP address to use. PROCESS - This will tell SurgeLDAP not only to process the external program (or LDAP server) but also preform the can command on SurgeLDAP. |       ie. shell main "\*objectClass=RTPerson" "search=/usr/local/surgeldap/netmeeting   -auth netmeeting mysecret" NONE * Added: Microsoft NetMeeting Client - Support.   With the use of the 2 new features: 'Dynamic Records' and 'Shell Command'   and the new external file called: netmeeting      SurgeLDAP now supports NetMeeting invalid LDAP requests.   See SurgeLDAP documention on how to set this up |
| 1.0a | 1st November 2002 | * SurgeLDAP - Your Solution to Database Storage -       SurgeLDAP is LDAP system which enables you to store large amounts of   data accessable from many appications. |
