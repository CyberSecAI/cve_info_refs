classes which could allow an attacker to access data on a Cache' server.

This vulnerability is in classes that are not required on production

systems and are only used during development. Removing them will have no

impact on a production system.

These classes are included in all releases of Cache' 5.0.

InterSystems recommends you remove them by using Terminal. Once connected

using Terminal, enter the following commands:

 zn "%cachelib"

 do $system.OBJ.DeletePackage("%template")

In addition please remove all .csp files from the following directories (if

installed):

\Dev\studio\templates

\Devuser\studio\templates

of your Cache installation (default: cachesys).

InterSystems is working on a solution to remove this vulnerability from

future versions.

For the purpose of this discussion, is it correct to say that any Cache'

system with a database mounted is a server?

And what about development/test systems?

Are they vulnerable but will feel the impact?

Also, the alert says to delete just \*.CSP, but is it fine to delete the

entire directories <cachesys>/dev and ./devuser on production systems?

I would like to have the vulnerability explained so that

(1) I can assess the threat to non-production systems; and

(2) I can avoid making a similar vulnerability in my code.

The template

files are used by the studio to assist in creating new

pages/routines/classes. The problem is they can be used to open system

level files - allowing people to access cache.key, cache.dat etc.

Because they are prefixed with % it leaves the entire cache system

vulnerable, not just samples as noted in a previous alert. Deleting the

entire /dev directory removes all samples from the system - not a bad

thing on a production system.
