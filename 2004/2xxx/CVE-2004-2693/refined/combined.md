SSRT3613 rev.0 HP-UX B6848AB GTK+ Support Libraries
               elevated privileges

 -----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTICE:
 There are no restrictions for distribution of this Bulletin
 provided that it remains complete and intact.

 The information in this Security bulletin should be acted upon
 as soon as possible.

INITIAL RELEASE:    10 May 2004

POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:    elevated privileges for a local
                              authorized user.

SOURCE:    HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY
                HP Software Security Response Team

REFERENCES:    None

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:

A potential vulnerability has been identified with HP-UX running
B6848AB GTK+ Support Libraries where a directory permissions issue
could be exploited to allow a local authorized user to gain
elevated privileges.

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.11 with B6848AB GTK+ Support Libraries
installed

BACKGROUND:
     The product B6848AB (GTK+ Libraries) is available for
    download from software.hp.com:

    < <http://www.software.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot_parser.cgi/cgi/>
     displayProductInfo.pl?productNumber=B6848AB>

    The source files in this product are world writable.
    After the product is installed any user can modify the
    source.  If new libraries are to be built using this
    source code the files should be verified.

    The web page above has the following description of B6848AB:

      The GTK+ Libraries are the open source GNU toolkit for X
      windows development. The version provided here is
      unsupported, but is provided for use with the unsupported
      Mozilla browser for 10.20 and for old versions of Netscape
      (i.e. 6.2.1), which depend on it. We recommend upgrading to
      a newer browser/OS combo, such as Mozilla for HP-UX 11.0
      and later, which require a newer version of the GTK.

    Note: Product B6848BA (ximian gnome 1.4 gtk+ libraries for
          hp-ux) does NOT have this permissions problem.

     AFFECTED VERSIONS

     Note: To determine if a system has an affected version,
           search the output of "swlist -a revision -l fileset"
           for an affected fileset.  Then determine if the
           recommended patch or update is installed.

     HP-UX B.11.00
     HP-UX B.11.11
     =============
      GTK+.GTK+-SRC
      GLib.GLIB-SRC
      action: remove (optionally reinstall and change perms)
              install revision 1.2.10.2.1 or subsequent.

      Gettext.GETTEXT-SRC
      action: remove (optionally reinstall and change perms)
              install revision 0.10.39.2.1 or subsequent.

     END AFFECTED VERSIONS

RESOLUTION:
    Note: The directory permissions are secure in all versions
          of B6848BA.  However, only B6848BA revision 1.4.gm.46
          or subsequent resolves the permissions issue for
          directories installed by  B6848AB.

    Note:  B6848AB is only required for Netscape 6,  which is no
              longer supported on HP-UX.   The recommended
              solution is HP's Mozilla ([www.hp.com/go/mozilla](http://www.hp.com/go/mozilla)),
              which requires B6848BA.

    If B6848BA is needed:

    1. Remove B6848AB.
       This removes any potentially altered source files.
       However, the directories remain with unsafe permissions.

    2. Install B6848BA revision 1.4.gm.46 or subsequent.
       This corrects the directory permissions.

    3. Reinstall B6848AB if it is needed.

    If B6848BA is not needed and B6848AB is needed.

    1. Remove B6848AB.

    2. Reinstall B6848AB.

    3. Immediately make the following changes to directory
       permissions:

         chmod 555 /opt/gnome/src/GLib/glib-1.2.8
         chmod 555 /opt/gnome/src/GLib/glib-1.2.8/docs
         chmod 555 /opt/gnome/src/GLib/glib-1.2.8/gmodule

         chmod 555 /opt/gnome/src/Gettext/gettext-0.10.35/tests

MANUAL ACTIONS:  Yes - NonUpdate

Install B6848BA revision 1.4.gm.46 or subsequent.
Reinstall B6848AB if necessary.
  or

 [http://itrc.hp.com/cki/bin/doc.pl/screen=ckiSecurityBulletin](http://itrc.hp.com/cki/bin/doc.pl/screen%3DckiSecurityBulletin)

The HP-UX Security Patch Matrix is available here:
<http://itrc.hp.com/service/cki/docDisplay.do?docId=>
hpuxSecurityMatrix
Or via anonymous ftp:
ftp://ftp.itrc.hp.com/export/patches/hp-ux_patch_matrix/

The HP-UX Security Patch Matrix, updated daily, categorizes
security patches by platform/OS release, and by Bulletin topic.
The Security Patch Check tool completely automates the process of
reviewing the Security Patch Matrix for HP-UX 11.XX Versions.
NOTE: Installing patches listed in the Security Patch Matrix will
completely implement the RESOLUTION in the Security Bulletin
_only_ if there are no MANUAL ACTIONS included.

The Security Patch Check tool can also verify that a Security
Bulletin RESOLUTION has been implemented on HP-UX 11.XX Versions
provided that no MANUAL ACTIONS were included. The Security Patch
Check tool cannot verify patches implemented via product upgrade.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
