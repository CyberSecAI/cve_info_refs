Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause lies in implementation flaws within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) of mobile Java (J2ME) developed by Sun Microsystems. These flaws are not in the Java language itself, but in how specific implementations of the JVM handle Java code execution on mobile devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **JVM Implementation Flaws**: The core weakness is the way the JVM is implemented on affected mobile devices, leading to security bypasses.
- **Lack of Proper Security Checks**: The vulnerabilities allow malicious Java applications to bypass the expected security sandbox and gain unauthorized access to system resources and data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Theft**: Attackers can access and steal sensitive data stored on the phone, including phonebook contacts, SMS messages, and dialed numbers.
- **Unauthorized SMS Sending**: Malicious apps can send arbitrary SMS messages to any phone number without the user's knowledge or consent, potentially incurring costs for the user.
- **Data Exfiltration**: Attackers can transfer data to and from the internet without user awareness.
- **Persistent Backdoors**: Attackers could write to the permanent memory of the phone, creating a backdoor for future access.
- **Device Unusability**: Attackers have the ability to render the phone unusable through their exploits.
- **Complete Break of Java Security:** The described exploits can effectively bypass the Java security model on the device and gain access to the underlying operating system's functionality

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Java Applications:** The primary attack vector involves deploying specially crafted Java applications to the mobile device. These applications exploit the vulnerabilities when executed by the device's JVM.
- **Distribution Methods:** While not explicitly detailed, these malicious Java applications could be distributed through various means such as:
    - Direct installation via USB.
    - Over-the-air download via WAP or other mobile protocols.
    - Bundled with seemingly harmless software or games.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Technical Expertise:** The attacker requires a strong understanding of Java programming, particularly J2ME, and a solid grasp of the JVM vulnerabilities.
- **Ability to Craft Exploits:** The attacker needs the skills to develop malicious Java applications that specifically target the identified flaws.
- **Access to Distribution Channel:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted malicious application to the targeted phone, which could be through a website, email, or by tricking the user into installing a malicious application.
- **Proximity/Network Access**: In some attack scenarios, an attacker might need proximity to the target device, or the ability to intercept and modify the network traffic to deliver the exploit. However, the article mentions the possibility of arbitrary SMS sending and data transfer, suggesting remote exploitation is possible as well.

**Additional Information:**
- The research mentioned was done by Adam Gowdiak at Polandâ€™s Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center.
- The vulnerabilities were demonstrated on a Nokia 6310i, but believed to be present in many other phones from various manufacturers using flawed Java implementations.
-  The article notes these vulnerabilities are not easy to exploit, but the potential impact is very high

This detailed information goes beyond the basic description that would be provided in a typical CVE entry by including the attack vectors, required capabilities, and specific details on the impact.
