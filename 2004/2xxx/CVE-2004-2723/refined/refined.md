The provided content is related to CVE-2004-2723.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
NessusWX stores user credentials in plain text within configuration files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   Sensitive information (usernames and passwords) are stored in an unencrypted manner.
-   The application does not properly remove the credentials from the configuration file when removed through the GUI, leading to inconsistent behavior and retention of sensitive data even after removal in the GUI.
-   Lack of user notification about insecure storage of credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with access to the configuration file could retrieve user credentials for various services such as FTP, IMAP, POP2, POP3, NNTP, SNMP, and SMB, potentially gaining unauthorized access to these services.

**Attack vectors:**
Local file system access to the configuration files located in user-specific directories (e.g., C:\NessusDB\MySession.session\preferences).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have access to the file system where NessusWX stores session configuration files. This could be achieved through physical access to the machine or through other methods of remote access or malware installation.
