How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

R.A.M Security Advisory
-------------------------------------------------
<http://www.ramsecurity.us>
-------------------------------------------------
Severity: Medium
Title: e107 web portal user.php xss
Date: May 21, 2004
-------------------------------------------------

  Synopsis:

 All versions of e107 have a vulnerability that
allows javascript or html content in user.php.

  Description:

 All versions of e107 have a vulnerability that
allows xss or html tags and content to be posted to the
Website URL for a member.

 The Problem lies within the usersettings.php
which does not parse < > ( ) tags thus allowing any
user to insert a javascript or html. The problem is
in user.php where the information is displayed. When someone updates their url, AIM \
or MSN field with malicious content it is displayed without being correctly parsed. \
Here is an example of how the input might be crafted:

URL field:
[http://www.mysiteurl.com/&lt;script&gt;alert](http://www.mysiteurl.com/%26lt;script&gt;alert)(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;

AIM/MSN field: &lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;

Now whenever a user visits that members profile they
will get a javascript popup with their cookie
information while the link will just show:

<http://www.mysiteurl.com/>

and when the link is clicked on it will take the user
to mysiteurl.com.

  Impact:

 This may lead to cookie information being
stolen or other such xss attacks.

  Solution:

edit user.php from lines 233 to 261 to read. Remove spaces in the replace string so \
that & lt ; etc will form one word:

</td></tr> ";
$source = $user_aim;
//check for bad input and convert it to ISO-8859-1
$bad =  array("<",">","(",")");
$replace = array("& lt ;","& gt ;","& #40 ;","& #41 ;");
 $user_aim = str_replace($bad, $replace, $source);
foreach($user_aim as $aim) {
$user_aim = $aim;
}
$str .= "
                <td style='width:80%'class='forumheader3'>
                        <table style='width:100%'><tr><td style='width:30%'> <img \

                <td style='width:80%'class='forumheader3'> ";
$source = $user_msn;
$user_msn = str_replace($bad, $replace, $source);
foreach($user_msn as $msn) {
$user_msn = $msn;
}
$str .= "
