Because I stopped wasting my time with mainline kernels long time ago, and
because mainline folks seemed to prefer the most vulnerable loop crypto
implementation they could find (i.e. cryptoloop).

Just look at mainline folks merging another equally vulnerable and exploitable
implementation (i.e. dm-crypt), with exactly same vulnerabilities that
cryptoloop has, just in different package.

In loop-AES, "bad key management" issues were fixed years ago, and more
stronger IV was merged last year. Mainline folks still seem to be
puzzled/clueless with these issues.

-

Markku-Juhani O. Saarinen discovered watermark attack against cryptoloop,
here is his paper:

    <http://www.tcs.hut.fi/~mjos/doc/diskenc.pdf>

[just before posting I tested above link and it returns "You don't have
permission to access /~mjos/doc/diskenc.pdf on this server", ugh]

This attack exploits weakness in IV computation and knowledge of how file
systems place files on disk. This attack works with file systems that have
soft block size of 1024 or greater. At least ext2, ext3, reiserfs and minix
have such property. Don't know about xfs. This attack makes it possible to
detect presense of specially crafted watermarked files, such as, unreleased
Hollywood movies, cruise missile service manuals, and other content that you
did not create yourself. Watermarked files contain special bit patterns that
can be detected without decryption.

I have attached source for two programs, one to create such watermarked
files, and one to detect watermarks from ciphertext.

For example, if I were to encode my first name Jari as a watermark, I would
use ASCII characters 74 97 114 105. This example uses encodings 10...13.

    # mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /mnt -o loop=/dev/loop0,encryption=AES128
    Password:
    # ./create-watermark-encodings 10:74 11:97 12:114 13:105 >/mnt/watermarks
    # umount /mnt

And then to detect these watermarks, I do:

    # dd if=/dev/fd0 bs=64k | ./detect-watermark-encodings
    22+1 records in
    22+1 records out
    1474560 bytes scanned
    watermark encoding 10, count 74
    watermark encoding 11, count 97
    watermark encoding 12, count 114
    watermark encoding 13, count 105

Summary:
- cryptoloop and dm-crypt on-disk formats are FUBAR. cryptoloop and
  dm-crypto developers and users don't have any choice here. The _have_ to
  start using stronger crypto.
- Used cipher or key kength or password does not matter.
- loop-AES single-key mode on-disk format is equally FUBAR.
- loop-AES multi-key mode is not vulnerable.
- Anyone still setting up new encrypted file systems using cryptoloop or
  current dm-crypt or single-key loop-AES, is committing security
  malpractice.

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.
