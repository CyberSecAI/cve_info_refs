Phorum 3.4.5 Vulnerabilities

-----------------------------
Credit:
Author:     : Calum Power
Version(s)  : <= 3.4.5
Vendor      : Phorum
Vendor URL  : <http://phorum.org>

Vendor Contacted: Yes
Vendor Fix: Phorum has released Phorum v3.4.6 as a response to this
advisory. Please patch your vulnerable software ASAP.

Vulnerabilitiy:
Type: Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection
Severity: Moderately Critical

Summary:
Phorum  versions prior to 3.4.6 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting and
SQL injection bugs that could allow for the remote compromise of any
server running the affected software.

Details:
VULN #1:
     An XSS vulnerability exists in the script 'common.php' that allows
arbitrary code
     execution on the client-side browser.
     Ironically, this vulnerability is in the 'phorum_check_xss()' function.
     The vulnerable code is below:
         if(!is_array($value) && $key!="body" && $key!="subject" &&
$key!="hide" && stristr($value, "<DEFANGED_script")){
             echo "script detected in $key";
     By sending a HTTP/POST variable to any Phorum script, an attacker
could craft the key of the variable into
     an XSS attack, providing the value of the variable contains the string
"<DEFANGED_script".

     *** This vulnerability has been fixed in Phorum 5.0.2alpha. ***

     Severity: Medium - This vulnerability may be exploited to obtain user
login details, spam, or perform social-engineering upon the user.

VULN #2:
     Another XSS vulnerability exists in the script 'profile.php'. This
vulnerability exists via insufficient
     sanitization of the variable 'EditError'. If a user is logged on, an
attacker could use this vulnerability
     to include arbitrary code on the user's browser.
     NOTE: Phorum (common.php) does checks for '<DEFANGED_script>' tags,
however XSS
attacks are NOT limited to just the
     <DEFANGED_script> tags! An attacker could use many forms of XSS (such as
<DEFANGED_iframe>) to launch attacks upon users.
     *** This vulnerability has been fixed in Phorum 5.0.2alpha. ***

     Severity: Medium/Low - This can only be exploited when the user is
logged on, but as such could be used to reset passwords, or change any
other user info without the user knowing.

VULN #3:
     Once again, there is an XSS vulnerability in the script 'login.php'
that may allow attackers to execute
     arbitrary code in the users' browser (Woah, deja moo...)
     This exploit is due to (again) the 'Error' variable not being
sanitized correctly.
     I have created Proof-of-Concept code (using an <DEFANGED_iframe>) that
allows
for the stealing of user passwords as they are
     submitted into the form.
     *** This vulnerability has been fixed in Phorum 5.0.2alpha. ***

     Severity: High/Critical - Due to the nature of the page, sensitive
form values could be harvested by an attacker.

VULN #4:
     A SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the script 'register.php' in
the field 'hide_email'.
     This vulnerability could lead to the execution of SQL commands inside
the script.
     *** This code appears to not exist in Phorum 5.0.2alpha, so is
therefore fixed. ***

     Severity: High - Due to the location in which the SQL injection
variable is placed, it is increasingly hard to exploit this
vulnerability to obtain any sort of privilege escalation.

Information Security is like decent coffee - When you have it it's
blissful, but it disappears just as you get a taste for it.

high-availability and  visitor ease of use in mind. Features such as mailing list \
integration, easy customization and simple  installation make Phorum a powerful \
add-in to any website.

Affected versions:

# Phorum, The Original PHP and MySQL Forum Software

Started in 1998, Phorum was the original PHP and MySQL based Open Source forum software. Phorum's developers pride themselves on creating message board software that is designed to meet different needs of different web sites while not sacrificing performance or features.

| Performance The group of developers of Phorum had very different needs. Some needed software that could run a single forum with over 2,000 new posts per day. Others hosted over 4,000 forums on one server. The end result is a versatile product that can serve anyone's needs. | Freedom For the Phorum team, freedom means having the ability to make your message board do what you want it to do. Your message board should fit into your site. The developers of Phorum believe that the branding of the message board software should not over power the branding of your products and services. |
| --- | --- |
| Forum Customization To satisfy the web master that needs every bell and whistle, or those that want to make their web site unique, the Phorum team created a very flexible hook & module system. These hooks allow a webmaster to create modules for using external authentication, altering message data before its stored, adding custom information about users or messages... almost anything you could want. | Forum Design Phorum gives the web designers the power to rearrange the data in any shape, form or fashion they could want. The templates are in pure HTML with simple to understand text commands embedded in them. You can use the provided templates as a starting point or start from scratch. The power is in your hands. |
| News | Featured Phorum [Trainorders.com](http://www.trainorders.com/discussion/index.php)"Our web site may have never mushroomed in popularity without the power and flexibility of Phorum. Today, our customized version of Phorum serves out over 200,000 messages each day without bogging down our servers." |
