The provided content relates to CVE-2021-33643.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `gnu_longlink` function of the `libtar` library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, meaning the software attempts to access memory outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This occurs specifically when handling GNU long link entries in tar archives.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially cause a crash or read sensitive information by exploiting the out-of-bounds read, although the specific impact may depend on the context in which the library is used.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting a malicious tar archive containing a specially crafted GNU long link entry that triggers the out-of-bounds read during processing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted tar archive to a system or application using the vulnerable `libtar` library.
