The provided content describes a vulnerability in NoMachine server installations on Windows that allows for local privilege escalation via DLL Search Order Hijacking. This corresponds to CVE-2021-33436 based on the advisory content, which indicates a local privilege escalation vulnerability in NoMachine due to DLL hijacking.

- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by the NoMachine server application loading DLL files from directories present in the system's PATH environment variable. If a non-admin user has write permissions to one of those directories, a malicious DLL can be placed there and loaded by the NoMachine server process, resulting in privilege escalation.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** DLL Search Order Hijacking. The application loads DLLs without properly validating their origin, making it vulnerable to malicious DLL injection.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to local privilege escalation, potentially allowing a non-admin user to execute code with the privileges of the NoMachine server process.
- **Attack Vectors:**
    - The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a directory listed in the system's PATH variable.
    - The system PATH variable must include a directory writable by a non-admin user.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs local access to the Windows machine.
    - The attacker needs write permissions to a directory within the system's PATH environment variable.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, explaining the specific mechanism of the DLL Search Order Hijacking vulnerability and the conditions necessary for exploitation.
