## NoMachine 7.5.2 now available for download

Luxembourg, May 18th, 2021 - NoMachine makes available updated version 7 packages to fix issues affecting earlier releases and to consolidate some important security fixes including a security patch (CVE-2021-3472) released by the X.org project to fix input validation failures in the X server XInput extension.

In addition, a vulnerability recently discovered affecting NoMachine servers installations on Windows is included. Affected NoMachine packages for Windows are the free version of NoMachine, Enterprise Desktop and Cloud Server which could be exploited for local privileges escalation by means of DLL Search Order Hijacking. Exploitation is however only possible if system PATH variable contains a directory that is writable by non-admin users, which should not happen in normal conditions.

The full list of what is included is:

FR04S04157 - Assigning the first available Enterprise Desktop without reconnecting a user already logged-in
FR04S04162 - Patching X.Org code (CVE-2021-3472)

TR05S10236 - Possible local privileges escalation on Windows
TR04R09653 - After a period, users cannot any longer connect to Windows child servers because of a 'session negotiation failed' error
TR05S10233 - In an AD environment, users cannot connect to a new Windows node
TR03S10131- The NoMachine virtual desktop terminates with 'Unknown sequence number while processing queue'
TR03S10138 - Mouse pointer is offset on a physical Wayland desktop on multiple monitors
TR03S10164 - Problems when using DUO authentication in web sessions
TR04S10209 - Screen blanking doesn't work correctly in mirrored mode on macOS
TR05S10239 - Session fails with error "Maximum number of virtual sessions reached for user ..."
TR05S10231 - Sudden termination of the Connection Monitor after message 'Storing client credentials is not allowed'
TR05S10232 - The main server cannot log-in to the node when UserNXDirectoryPath is set
TR04S10198 - Under some circumstances, a file transferred in web session becomes corrupted
TR03S10129 - WebRTC sessions don't start with Chrome/Edge browsers v. 89

## NoMachine 6.15.1 now available for download

Luxembourg, May 18th, 2021 - NoMachine makes available updated version 6 packages to fix issues affecting earlier releases and to consolidate some important security fixes including a security patch (CVE-2021-3472) released by the X.org project to fix input validation failures in the X server XInput extension.

In addition, a vulnerability recently discovered affecting NoMachine servers installations on Windows is included. Affected NoMachine packages for Windows are the free version of NoMachine, Enterprise Desktop and Cloud Server which could be exploited for local privileges escalation by means of DLL Search Order Hijacking. Exploitation is however only possible if system PATH variable contains a directory that is writable by non-admin users, which should not happen in normal conditions.

The full list of what is included in version 6.15.1:

FR04S04153 - Updating nxhtd in packages v. 6 to Apache v. 2.4.46
FR04S04162 - Patching X.Org code (CVE-2021-3472)

TR05S10236 - Possible local privileges escalation on Windows
TR04R09653 - After a period, users cannot any longer connect to Windows child servers because of a 'session negotiation failed' error
TR03S10164 - Problems when using DUO authentication in web sessions
TR04S10198 - Under some circumstances, a file transferred in web session becomes corrupted
TR03S10129 - WebRTC sessions don't start with Chrome/Edge browsers v. 89

## Possible local privileges escalation on Windows

---

**Trouble report solved in version 6.15.1 and 7.5.2.**

---

NoMachine server installations on Windows could be exploited for local privileges escalation by means of DLL Search Order Hijacking.

Exploitation is however only possible if the system PATH variable contains a directory that is writable by non-admin users, which should not happen in normal conditions.

Affected NoMachine packages for Windows are: the free version of NoMachine, NoMachine Enterprise Desktop and NoMachine Cloud Server, both v. 7 and 6.
