{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `pool_installable` function within `src/repo.h`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-787"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS).",
     "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered within the `pool_installable` function, which operates on data related to package repositories and dependencies. The vulnerability can be triggered when processing crafted data that causes the index value used to access an internal map to be larger than the map's allocated size.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to control the input data that is processed by `libsolv`, specifically manipulating data related to package definitions and dependencies to create a situation where the `id>>3` is bigger than the allocated `size` of the `pool->considered->map`."
