- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, specifically a path traversal vulnerability in the container volume management component of Synology Docker.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local users can read or write arbitrary files.
- **Attack vectors**: Unspecified vectors, but the attack requires local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user with high privileges (PR:H) to exploit this vulnerability.
