{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the spaceport.sys driver, leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Out-of-bounds write"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local attacker",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system."
