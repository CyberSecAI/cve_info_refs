- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root password for SNMPv3 is not updated when the root password is changed via the command-line interface (CLI).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect Access Control (CWE-284), where the system fails to properly update the SNMPv3 root password when the CLI password is changed, leading to a persistent vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain access to the system with the old root password through SNMPv3, even after the CLI password has been changed. This allows the attacker to access sensitive data and perform actions on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through SNMPv3 using the old root password after the CLI password has been changed. The attacker can connect to the router via SNMPv3 using tools like LANmonitor or other SNMPv3 tools.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know the old root password and must be able to access the device via SNMPv3.
