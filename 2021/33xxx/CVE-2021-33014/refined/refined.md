Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-33014:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded credentials within the KUKA KR C4 system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The system contains hardcoded credentials that an attacker can exploit to gain access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain a VxWorks shell, providing a high level of control over the affected system. This access includes read, write, and delete capabilities.
* The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8, indicating a high severity.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
* The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
* An attacker requires low privileges (PR:L) to exploit this vulnerability.
* No user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker must be able to access the vulnerable system through the network.
* The attacker must have credentials, that due to being hardcoded, are likely easily obtainable.
* The attacker needs to log in to the system before gaining shell access.

**Summary of CVE-2021-33014:**
This CVE details a vulnerability in KUKA KR C4 systems stemming from the use of hardcoded credentials that allow for unauthorized access to a VxWorks shell. This access can lead to significant control over the affected system, including read, write, and delete actions. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, and the attacker requires low privileges, making this a severe security issue.
