This could allow the attacker to gain full control over the system, leading to data breaches, malware installation, or complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/hostapd` endpoint with malicious payloads in the `interface`, `ssid`, or `wpa_passphrase` parameters.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web interface of RaspAP to exploit this vulnerability."
