- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (CWE-89). The system fails to sanitize user-supplied input when importing firmware containers, allowing the injection of malicious SQL code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands in the local database of the affected system. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker imports a specially crafted firmware container to the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be authenticated with low privileges and have the ability to import firmware containers to the system.
