Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33451:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `fill_buffer()` function within the `stream.c` file of lrzip version 0.641.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory leak: The `fill_buffer()` function allocates memory but fails to free it, leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: Repeated exploitation of this memory leak can lead to memory exhaustion, eventually causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local: The attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable system.
- User Interaction Required: A user must open a specially crafted file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted file that, when processed by lrzip, triggers the memory leak in `fill_buffer()`.
- The attacker must convince a user to open or process the malicious file using the vulnerable version of lrzip.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to the lrzip project as issue #198.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) file is available to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in lrzip version 0.641.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-401 (Memory Leak)
- The CVSS v3 base score is 5.5, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.
