{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of `eval()` in the `status.py` module. The `func` variable, which is passed to `eval()`, is constructed based on configuration data retrieved using `__salt__['config.dot_vals']('status')`. This function fetches configuration keys starting with 'status'. The value after the first dot is then used to form the `func` variable, which is then passed to `eval()`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of `eval()` with data derived from configuration. Although the configuration data is expected to be trusted, the use of `eval()` on any user-provided input is inherently dangerous. The configuration data is not directly controlled by the user, but there is an implicit trust in the configuration data which is not well controlled."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the Salt minion where the vulnerable code is executed. The Salt minion is intended to execute commands as root, making this a critical vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "how": "An attacker could potentially inject malicious code by crafting a specific configuration under the 'status' key. The `config.dot_vals` function reads configuration data starting with 'status', and this is used to construct a function call. This configuration could be injected either via the minion config file, pillar data, grains, or master config, depending on the setup.",
      "where": "The vulnerable code is present in the `salt/modules/status.py` file, specifically in the `custom()` function which calls `eval(func)`.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the configuration data used by the Salt minion. This could mean having the ability to modify the minion configuration file, the pillar data, the grains data, or the master configuration (if `pillar_opts` is enabled in the master configuration). "

    },
      "additional_details": "While the code uses `eval()`, the vulnerability was determined to be a false positive because the configuration keys are not directly user controlled and the `__salt__` object is not modifiable by design."
