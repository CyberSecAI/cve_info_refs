# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Debian Bug     : 988386

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in NTFS-3G, a read-write NTFS
driver for FUSE. A local user can take advantage of these flaws for
local root privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1:2016.2.22AR.1+dfsg-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ntfs-3g packages.

For the detailed security status of ntfs-3g please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ntfs-3g>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Subject: NTFS3G-SA-2021-0001: Multiple buffer overflows in all versions of
 NTFS-3G

Security vulnerabilities were identified in the open source NTFS-3G and
NTFSPROGS software. These vulnerabilities were confirmed and resolved.
To our knowledge, these vulnerabilities have not been exploited.

These vulnerabilities may allow an attacker using a maliciously crafted
NTFS-formatted image file or external storage to potentially execute
arbitrary privileged code, if the attacker has either local access and
the ntfs-3g binary is setuid root, or if the attacker has physical
access to an external port to a computer which is configured to run the
ntfs-3g binary or one of the ntfsprogs tools when the external storage
is plugged into the computer. These vulnerabilities result from
incorrect validation of some of the NTFS metadata that could potentially
cause buffer overflows, which could be exploited by an attacker. Common
ways for attackers to gain physical access to a machine is through
social engineering or an evil maid attack on an unattended computer.

We recommend installing and applying the update with the security fixes,
and advise to follow security guidance and frameworks such as NIST for
assessing and improving an organization’s abilities to prevent, detect,
and respond to security threats and cyber attacks.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS: All previous versions of open source NTFS-3G and
NTFSPROGS.

WORKAROUND: None

SOLUTION: Upgrade to 2021.8.22

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# OPEN SOURCE NTFS-3G SECURITY ADVISORY NTFS3G-SA-2021-0001

Moderate

[unsound](/unsound)
published
GHSA-q759-8j5v-q5jp
Aug 30, 2021

## Package

ntfs-3g
(FUSE)

## Affected versions

< 2021.8.22

## Patched versions

2021.8.22

## Description

Security vulnerabilities were identified in the open source NTFS-3G and NTFSPROGS software. These vulnerabilities were confirmed and resolved. To our knowledge, these vulnerabilities have not been exploited.

These vulnerabilities may allow an attacker using a maliciously crafted NTFS-formatted image file or external storage to potentially execute arbitrary privileged code, if the attacker has either local access and the ntfs-3g binary is setuid root, or if the attacker has physical access to an external port to a computer which is configured to run the ntfs-3g binary or one of the ntfsprogs tools when the external storage is plugged into the computer. These vulnerabilities result from incorrect validation of some of the NTFS metadata that could potentially cause buffer overflows, which could be exploited by an attacker. Common ways for attackers to gain physical access to a machine is through social engineering or an evil maid attack on an unattended computer.

We recommend installing and applying the update with the security fixes, and advise to follow security guidance and frameworks such as NIST for assessing and improving an organization’s abilities to prevent, detect, and respond to security threats and cyber attacks.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS: All previous versions of open source NTFS-3G and NTFSPROGS.

WORKAROUND: None

SOLUTION: Upgrade to 2021.8.22
