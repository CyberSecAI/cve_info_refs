{
  "CVE-2021-33701": {
    "Root cause": "The `IT_WHERE_CLAUSE` parameter of the function module `IUUC_RECON_RC_COUNT_TABLE_BIG` in SAP Netweaver is vulnerable to both ABAP code injection and ADBC SQL injection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unfiltered user input is used to dynamically generate ABAP code, leading to ABAP code injection.",
      "The fix for ABAP code injection introduced an ADBC SQL injection due to insufficient filtering of user input in SQL statements."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary ABAP code or SQL commands, potentially leading to:\n\t* Full compromise of the SAP application server.\n\t*  Data breaches by accessing sensitive data.\n\t*  Manipulation of data through arbitrary write operations.\n\t*  Break out of the current client context.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote attacks via RFC, leveraging the remote-enabled nature of the vulnerable function module."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs:\n\t*  Authorization object `S_DMIS` with at least display access.\n\t*  Authorization to perform function calls (`S_RFC`).\n\t*  In some cases local access to SE37 for local privilege escalation.\n\t*  Knowledge of a vulnerable SAP system and its configuration.  \n\t* If internal RFC communications are unencrypted,  wiretapping DMIS related account passwords increases the likelihood of exploitation"
