- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw in the Control>Center's log file API.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The log file API allows an authenticated user to read files outside of the intended log directory. This is a classic LFI vulnerability, where the application improperly handles user-provided input that specifies a file path.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user can read arbitrary files on the host system where Control>Center is running, provided the files have sufficiently open permissions. This could expose sensitive information such as configuration files, application data, or other system files.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the Control>Center's log file API, which is accessible to authenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a valid and authenticated user of Control>Center with access to the log file API. The attacker must also be able to reach the web application from their machine.
