Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33176:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by malformed MQTT messages that cause excessive memory consumption in VerneMQ. This leads to the application being terminated by the operating system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper handling of malformed MQTT messages. Specifically, the message broker fails to handle malformed input properly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS). Successful exploitation causes the VerneMQ application to consume large amounts of memory, ultimately resulting in termination of the application. This prevents the message broker from functioning, disrupting services that depend on it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Network. The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted, malformed MQTT messages to the broker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the VerneMQ message broker to send the malicious MQTT messages. No authentication is required as mentioned in the CVSS vector "PR:N".

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered using a fuzz testing tool called Defensics.
*   The CVSS 3.1 score is 8.6 (High) with the vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/RL:O/RC:C which aligns with the description of the vulnerability as a remotely exploitable DoS.
*   The fix is to upgrade to VerneMQ version 1.12.0 or later.
