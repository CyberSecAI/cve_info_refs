The provided content is related to CVE-2021-33185.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `AK::BitmapView::count_in_range` function. Specifically, when calculating the `last` pointer within the function, it can result in an out-of-bounds access when the bitmap size is a multiple of 8.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: `count_in_range` calculates a `last` pointer that can point beyond the allocated memory for the bitmap.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to memory corruption. The ASAN report indicates a read of size 1 at an address outside the allocated bitmap memory.
- In the provided test case, the overflow leads to the test failing and application termination, but in a real world scenario this could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered internally during the execution of the `set_range` test in the `TestBitmap` suite, specifically during the call to `count_slow()` which invokes the vulnerable `count_in_range()` function.
- An attacker could potentially exploit this through crafted usage of the `Bitmap` class, specifically when calling set_range on bitmaps of size aligned on 8.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to control the parameters passed to `Bitmap::set_range`, to set a range and then trigger the calculation using `count_in_range` which uses the underlying bitmap data.
