- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly handle errors when processing malformed requests, leading to the leakage of an application token.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper error handling, leading to the exposure of sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could leak an application token, potentially leading to unauthorized access or further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending malformed requests to the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the application and have low privileges (PR:L).
