Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `/formVirtualServ` page of the D-Link DIR-809 router's firmware.
- The `get_var` function extracts user-controlled input from HTTP requests, specifically values associated with keys of the format "name_%d".
- The extracted string is then copied onto the stack using `strcpy` without any length checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:**  The use of `strcpy` without bounds checking allows an attacker to overwrite stack memory by providing a long string as input. This overwrite can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Multiple instances:** The provided information highlights three such stack overflow vulnerabilities of the same type within the identified function (`FUN_8004776c`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the router's system. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as:
    - Complete control of the device
    - Data exfiltration
    - Denial of service
    - Network pivoting

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/formVirtualServ.htm` endpoint.
- **Malicious input:** The crafted POST request includes oversized input strings for the "name_%d" parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable router, which could be from the local network or, potentially, if the router's management interface is exposed to the internet.
- **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to create and send a malicious HTTP POST request to the router's web interface.
- **Understanding of the vulnerable parameters:** The attacker must know the vulnerable parameter names ("name_%d") and the vulnerable endpoint (`/formVirtualServ.htm`) to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided PoC demonstrates how to exploit the first vulnerability using an oversized string in the `name_0` parameter.
- The exploit is applicable to the D-Link DIR-809 router with firmware version `DIR-809Ax_FW1.12WWB03_20190410`.
- The vendor has confirmed the vulnerability.
