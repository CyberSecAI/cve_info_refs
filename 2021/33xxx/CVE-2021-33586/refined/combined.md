# InspIRCd: Information disclosure — GLSA **202107-22**

An information disclosure vulnerability in InspIRCd may allow
remote attackers to obtain sensitive information.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-irc/inspircd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.10.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.10.0** |

### Background

InspIRCd is a modular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server written in C++
which was created from scratch to be stable, modern and lightweight.

### Description

InspIRCd incorrectly handled malformed PONG messages, resulting in
access of freed memory.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send crafted packets to the server, possibly
allowing them to obtain sensitive information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All InspIRCd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-irc/inspircd-3.10.0"

```
