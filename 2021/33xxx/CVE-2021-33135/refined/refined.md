Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Uncontrolled resource consumption in the Intel SGX Linux kernel drivers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Linux kernel drivers for Intel SGX.
*   Specifically, the issue stems from the lack of proper resource management within the driver.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker can exhaust resources, making the system or service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local access is required. The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be an authenticated user with local access to the system.
*   They need to interact with the Intel SGX Linux kernel drivers in a way that triggers the uncontrolled resource consumption.
*   The user needs to have high privileges to cause the denial of service.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Intel SGX Linux kernel driver version 2.14 and earlier.
*   It also affects the upstream/kernel.org version of the Intel SGX driver.
*   Mitigation involves restricting access to the `/dev/sgx_enclave` device node, which is used for loading SGX enclaves. This is enforced by default in newer distributions with systemd v248 or later using the "*sgx*" group.
*   Partitioning SGX enclave apps in separate virtual machines is also recommended.
*   General security practices, such as least privilege principles, are also advised.
