Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-33203:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Django admindocs, specifically the `TemplateDetailView`. This view allowed staff members to check for the existence of arbitrary files. If the default admindocs templates were customized to expose file contents, this would also lead to exposure of the file content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal issue. The `TemplateDetailView` did not properly sanitize or validate file paths, allowing an attacker to potentially access files outside the intended template root directories.
- **Information Disclosure:** If the admindocs templates were customized to display the file contents, an attacker could potentially read the content of arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to check the existence of files. With customized templates, an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information by reading arbitrary files on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves using the `admindocs` `TemplateDetailView` with maliciously crafted paths to probe for and potentially access files. This is done over HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a staff member with access to the Django admin interface.
- No user interaction is required.
- No special network positioning is required, only the ability to access the web application.

**Additional Details**

- This vulnerability is classified as having low severity by the Django security policy.
- The fix involves applying path sanitization to ensure only files within template root directories can be loaded.
- NetApp products that incorporate Django were affected by this vulnerability, however, the specific products affected are not named in the provided NetApp advisory, which states "None"
