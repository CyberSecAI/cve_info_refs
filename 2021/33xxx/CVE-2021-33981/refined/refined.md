The provided content describes two vulnerabilities, one of which is CVE-2021-33981.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   **CVE-2021-33981:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). The application uses a user-controlled `customerId` parameter in the API request without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CVE-2021-33981:** Authorization bypass through user-controlled key.
*   The application fails to validate if the user making the request is authorized to access the data for the specified `customerId`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **CVE-2021-33981:** Information disclosure. An attacker can retrieve sensitive personal information (name, address, DOB, licenses, and license images) of other users. Additionally, it could reveal firearms ownership by targeting hunting license holders.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **CVE-2021-33981:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the "Fish | Hunt FL" application. They can then manipulate the `customerId` parameter in the POST request to the `getcustomerlicense` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **CVE-2021-33981:** The attacker needs a valid user account for the "Fish | Hunt FL" application. They need to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
