Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33512:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the ability to upload malicious files, specifically SVG and HTML files, which can be used to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

  - Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
  - Redirecting the victim to a malicious website.
  - Defacing the website

**Attack Vectors:**
- File upload functionality: An attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG or HTML file containing malicious JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
