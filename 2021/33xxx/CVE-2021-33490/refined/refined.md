Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-33490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of HTML content stored as "snippets" within the Open-Xchange (OX) App Suite backend. Specifically, the system fails to properly sanitize invalid HTML stored in snippets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS (CWE-80). By storing malicious, broken HTML code in a snippet, an attacker can inject arbitrary script code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Malicious script execution:** Successful exploitation allows the execution of malicious script code within a user's browser context.

- **Unwanted actions:**  Attackers can trigger unwanted actions through the web interface, like redirecting users to malicious third-party sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves the use of "snippets", for example a mail signature which can be shared.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to the victim's account or shared context:** An attacker needs either access to the victim's account or needs to be in the same context as the victim to exploit this vulnerability. For example by creating a malicious snippet and making the victim select it as their mail signature.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to select the malicious snippet which is then rendered by the application.
