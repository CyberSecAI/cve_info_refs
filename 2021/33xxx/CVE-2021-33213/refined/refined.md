Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The "Upload from URL" function in HTTP Commander lacks proper user input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The application allows users to specify a URL, which is then fetched by the server. This allows the server to make requests to arbitrary HTTP and FTP resources, including internal network resources and the loopback interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Access to Internal Resources: An attacker can access sensitive files or resources located within the internal network that are not directly accessible from the outside.
- Port Scanning: An attacker can perform port scans of the server itself or other internal systems by requesting URLs with specific ports. This can be used to gather information about services running on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the "Upload from URL" functionality of the web application.
- An attacker can provide a malicious URL to the application via a POST request to the `UploadFromURLHandler.ashx` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the HTTP Commander web application interface and the ability to interact with the "Upload from URL" feature. No special privileges are mentioned as needed to use this functionality.

**Technical Details:**
- The advisory provides a proof of concept demonstrating how to download internal files by providing an internal URL (e.g., `http://filer.internal/secret-passwordfile.txt`).
- It also demonstrates how to perform a port scan by submitting a request with a loopback address and a specific port (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:445`). Different error messages indicate whether the port is open or closed.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2021-33213.
- The affected version is any version prior to 5.3.3.2020.11.16.
- The vendor released a patch in version 5.3.5, and the vulnerable feature can be disabled by administrators.
- In new installations, the feature is disabled by default.
