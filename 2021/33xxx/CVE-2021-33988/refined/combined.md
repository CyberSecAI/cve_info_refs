| **Microweber Reflected XSS**  **Vuln Description:**  *Reflected XSS attacks, also known as non-persistent attacks, occur when a malicious script is reflected of a web application to the victim's browser. The script is activated through a link, which sends a request to a website with a vulnerability that enables execution of malicious scripts.*  **Impact: High** *The impact of an exploited XSS vulnerability on a web application varies a lot. It ranges from user's Session Hijacking, and if used in conjunction with a social engineering attack it can also lead to disclosure of sensitive data.* **POC:**  Identified un-Authenticated XSS on microweber CMS Version =< 1.2.7.  1.Post request is modified to insert XSS payload  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15015160/119272806-84a2b680-bc25-11eb-8bca-2091220bd900.png)   2.
