The provided content describes a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Microweber CMS version 1.2.7.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back in the response.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS: Malicious script is injected into a request and reflected back in the response, leading to execution of the injected script in the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Session Hijacking: An attacker can potentially steal a user's session cookie.
- Sensitive data disclosure: An attacker can gain access to sensitive data if used in conjunction with a social engineering attack.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious POST request to the `/latest/module/` endpoint.
- The XSS payload is injected into the `module` parameter within the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft and send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
