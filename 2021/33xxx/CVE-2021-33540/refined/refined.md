- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the presence of an undocumented, password-protected FTP access to the root directory within certain Phoenix Contact AXL F BK and IL BK product families. This access uses hard-coded credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the use of hard-coded credentials for FTP access (CWE-798).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who obtains the hard-coded password can access the FTP area and potentially read scrambled monitoring information of the device. This access can lead to unauthorized access and information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based and involves exploiting the undocumented FTP service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to reach the FTP service, which implies network connectivity to the device and must know/obtain the hard-coded password for the FTP service.
