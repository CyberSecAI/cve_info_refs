- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected system does not properly check if a user-controlled relative path remains within the intended target directory when downloading files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal (CWE-22)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can download arbitrary files from the system. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated attacker can send crafted requests to the system's web interface, manipulating the file download path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with low-level privileges on the system to exploit the vulnerability.
