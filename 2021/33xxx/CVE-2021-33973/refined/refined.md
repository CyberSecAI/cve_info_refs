Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33973:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is not explicitly detailed in the provided text. The pastebin content indicates a "Local Privilege Escalation" (LPE) vulnerability within 360 Total Security. The blog post mentions that vulnerabilities in anti-virus software can be exploited for "remote intrusion" and "persistent monitoring", which gives a general idea but no specific technical details of the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Local Privilege Escalation (LPE): The primary vulnerability is an LPE, allowing an attacker to gain higher privileges on the local system.
*   The blog post also mentions additional vulnerabilities, including those relating to remote code execution (RCE) and sandbox escape, although not specific to CVE-2021-33973.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can elevate their privileges from a regular user to a higher level, potentially system level, allowing them to control the system.
*   **System Control:** With elevated privileges, an attacker can install malware, modify system settings, access sensitive information, and perform other malicious activities.
*   **Remote Intrusion and Persistent Monitoring:** As described in the blog post, vulnerabilities in AV products can be turned into points of intrusion and persistent monitoring, which could be enabled with privilege escalation, although not specific to this CVE.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is local, indicating the attacker must have some initial access to the system to exploit the privilege escalation vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to a system with the vulnerable version of 360 Total Security installed.
