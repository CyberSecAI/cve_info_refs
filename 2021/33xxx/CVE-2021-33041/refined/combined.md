### **[notaisy](/notaisy)** commented [May 17, 2021](#issue-893109109)

| Hi, I'd like to report a security vulnerability in lastest release :  Description: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability(also execute constructed malicious code) Date: 2021.05.17 Version: v1.26.2~v1.34.0 Tested on: Windows10 & Mac POC The program does not properly handle the content of the code, causing the program to have a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which can also execute constructed malicious code   1. creat poc.md file with the following content: `<img src=1 onerror=alert(/xss/)>` 2. use vmd.exe to open the poc.md ,the poc code is executed 3. pop up calc.exe  XSS the file content code : `<img src=1 onerror=alert(/xss/)>`  [xss_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84305906/118453684-15f7c180-b72a-11eb-9f36-cebe32b3009c.png) Execute malicious code the file content code : `<a onmouseover="require('child_process').execSync('calc.exe')">POC Link</a>`  use vmd.exe open poc.md file to execute malicious code with xss vulnerability: [calc_exe_windows](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84305906/118453765-2dcf4580-b72a-11eb-86a3-41fd9863e79a.png)  when vmd.exe open the poc.md file , the poc code parsed in vmd.exe `div class="markdown-body" </div>`, so it executed: [calc_exe_windowss_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84305906/118454136-9d453500-b72a-11eb-8023-53327eb858e9.png)  Use the Poc `<a onmouseover="require('child_process').execSync('open -na Calculator')">POC Link</a>` on Mac:  [vmd_poc_mac](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84305906/118462045-da142a80-b730-11eb-87f2-989ec695d578.gif) How to fix  1. Use an appropriate escaping/encoding technique depending on where user input is to be used: HTML escape, JavaScript escape, CSS escape, URL escape, etc. 2. VMD should sanitize the content in order to avoid XSS. |

| Hello, notaisy, and the other friends of this project. Yeah, buddy, I've decided to investigate this case, and yeah, there is have a big problem, only for a stupid example, if someone malicious guy sends `md` file with malicious content, and for example, the user is a real user ;) and don't know what actually is going on, the game is over for him.   ---  debug and proof of concept: <https://streamable.com/oykc86> <https://streamable.com/ngx2xm> <https://streamable.com/j7e13y>  BR |
