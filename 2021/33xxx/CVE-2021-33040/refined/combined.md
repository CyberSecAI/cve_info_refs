|  |  | ## Scripted Content |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | [Scripted content](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-scripted-content), JavasScript the ePub HTML content, is disabled by default due to the potential for executing malicious content. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This is done by sandboxing the iframe the content is rendered into, though it is still recommened to santize the ePub content server-side as well. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If a trusted ePub contains interactivity, it can be enabled by passing `allowScriptedContent: true` to the `Rendition` settings. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```html |
|  |  | <script> |
|  |  | var rendition = book.renderTo("area", { |
|  |  | width: 600, |
|  |  | height: 400, |
|  |  | allowScriptedContent: true |
|  |  | }); |
|  |  | </script> |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This will allow the sandboxed content to run scripts, but currently makes the sandbox insecure. |
