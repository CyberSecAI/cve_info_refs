SUMMARY

Siemens has released version V13.0.2.0 for JT Utilities to ﬁx multiple vulnerabilities that could be triggered
when reading JT ﬁles.

Siemens recommends to update to the latest version, which contains solutions to all the vulnerabilities
listed in this advisory. Standing recommendation is to avoid opening of untrusted ﬁles from unknown
sources in the affected product, as this generally mitigates the risk of exploitation of this class of
vulnerabilities for any product release.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

JT is an openly published data format developed by Siemens Digital Industries Software, widely used for
communication, visualization, digital mockup and a variety of other purposes. JT has been accepted by

ISO as International Standard 14306:2017. The JT Utilities provide a series of command line utilities that
can be used to support application development and JT reuse.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-33713

When parsing specially crafted JT ﬁles, a hash function is called with an incorrect argument leading
the application to crash. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to cause a Denial-of-Service
condition in the application.

Argument

Vulnerability CVE-2021-33714

When parsing specially crafted JT ﬁles, a missing check for the validity of an iterator leads to
NULL pointer deference condition, causing the application to crash. An attacker could leverage this
vulnerability to cause a Denial-of-Service condition in the application.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-33715

When parsing specially crafted JT ﬁles, a race condition could cause an object to be released before
being operated on, leading to NULL pointer deference condition and causing the application to crash.
An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to cause a Denial-of-Service condition in the application.
