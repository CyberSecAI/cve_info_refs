Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33525:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `export.php` script of the EyesOfNetwork (EON) web application, specifically within the Lilac module. This allows for the injection of arbitrary shell commands through the `nagios_path` parameter.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input for the `nagios_path` parameter, allowing an attacker to embed and execute arbitrary shell commands on the server.
    *  **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application's failure to sanitize input before using it in a system command is the core weakness enabling the command injection.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to remote command execution on the server with the privileges of the web server user. This allows an attacker to:
    *   Gain complete control of the server.
    *   Access or modify sensitive data.
    *   Potentially pivot to other systems on the network.
    *   Install malware or other malicious tools.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/lilac/export.php` endpoint.
    *  **`nagios_path` Parameter Manipulation:** The payload is injected within the `nagios_path` parameter in the POST data.
    *  **Authenticated Access Required**: The attacker needs to authenticate to the EyesOfNetwork application before being able to exploit this vulnerability.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
    *   **Valid Credentials:** The attacker needs valid credentials for the EyesOfNetwork web application.
    *  **Understanding of the Application**: The attacker needs to understand how the `export.php` script is being used in order to create a successful exploit.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided `eon-pwn.sh` script details the exploit steps:
    1.  **Authentication:** The script first authenticates to the EON web application using provided credentials.
    2.  **Cookie Extraction:** It extracts the session ID to maintain an authenticated session.
    3.  **Payload Creation:** It creates a shell script (`payload.sh`) to establish a reverse shell connection back to the attacker's machine.
    4.  **Command Injection:** It sends a POST request to `export.php`, injecting a series of commands through the `nagios_path` parameter. These commands download, execute the reverse shell script, and establish the connection.
*   The exploit script targets versions greater than or equal to 5.3.11.
*   The script attempts to clean up after exploitation, by removing the temporary file used and starting a listening server in the background.
*   The script suggests a way of privesc once the reverse shell is obtained.

**Summary:**

The content provides a good description of the vulnerability, including the root cause, weaknesses, impact, attack vector, and required attacker capabilities. The provided exploit script provides a practical example of how the vulnerability can be exploited.

**CVE-2021-33525** is a command injection vulnerability due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `nagios_path` parameter within the `/lilac/export.php` page of EyesOfNetwork application, allowing an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying server.
