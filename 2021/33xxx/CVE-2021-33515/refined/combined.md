Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-208340a217
2021-07-05 01:32:59.844887
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : dovecot
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 2.3.15
Release : 1.fc34
URL : <http://www.dovecot.org/>
Summary : Secure imap and pop3 server
Description :
Dovecot is an IMAP server for Linux/UNIX-like systems, written with security
primarily in mind. It also contains a small POP3 server. It supports mail
in either of maildir or mbox formats.

The SQL drivers and authentication plug-ins are in their subpackages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

\* CVE-2021-29157: Dovecot does not correctly escape kid and azp fields in
JWT tokens. This may be used to supply attacker controlled keys to
validate tokens, if attacker has local access. \* CVE-2021-33515: On-path
attacker could have injected plaintext commands before STARTTLS
negotiation that would be executed after STARTTLS finished with the
client. \* Disconnection log messages are now more standardized across services.
They also always now start with "Disconnected" prefix. \* Dovecot now depends on
libsystemd for systemd integration. \* Removed support for Lua 5.2. Use version
5.1 or 5.3 instead. \* config: Some settings are now marked as "hidden". It's
discouraged to change these settings. They will no longer be visible in
doveconf output, except if they have been changed or if doveconf -s
parameter is used. See <https://doc.dovecot.org/settings/advanced/> for
details. \* imap-compress: Compression level is now algorithm specific.
See <https://doc.dovecot.org/settings/plugin/compress-plugin/> \* indexer-worker:
Convert "Indexed" info logs to an event named
"indexer\_worker\_indexing\_finished". See
[https://doc.dovecot.org/admin\_manual/list\_of\_events/#indexer-worker-indexing...](https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/#indexer-worker-indexing-)
finished + Add TSLv1.3 support to min\_protocols. + Allow configuring
ssl\_cipher\_suites. (for TLSv1.3+) + acl: Add acl\_ignore\_namespace setting which
allows to entirely ignore ACLs for the listed namespaces. + imap:
Support official RFC8970 preview/snippet syntax. Old methods of
retrieving preview information via IMAP commands ("SNIPPET and PREVIEW
with explicit algorithm selection") have been deprecated. + imapc: Support
INDEXPVT for imapc storage to enable private message flags for cluster
wide shared mailboxes. + lib-storage: Add new events: mail\_opened,
mail\_expunge\_requested, mail\_expunged, mail\_cache\_lookup\_finished. See
<https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/#mail> + zlib, imap-
compression, fs-compress: Support compression levels that the
algorithm supports. Before, we would allow hardcoded value between 1
to 9 and would default to 6. Now we allow using per-algorithm value
range and default to whatever default the algorithm specifies. - \*-login:
Commands pipelined together with and just after the authenticate
command cause these commands to be executed twice. This applies to all
protocols that involve user login, which currently comprises of imap,
pop3, submisision and managesieve. - \*-login: Processes are supposed to
disconnect the oldest non-logged in connection when process\_limit was
reached. This didn't actually happen with the default "high-security
mode" (with service\_count=1) where each connection is handled by a
separate process. - \*-login: When login process reaches client/process limits,
oldest client connections are disconnected. If one of these was still
doing anvil lookup, this caused a crash. This could happen only if the
login process limits were very low or if the server was overloaded. -
Fixed building with link time optimizations (-flto). - auth: Userdb iteration
with passwd driver does not always return all users with some nss
drivers. - dsync: Shared INBOX not synced when "mail\_shared\_explicit\_inbox" was
disabled. If a user has a shared mailbox which is another user's INBOX,
dsync didn't include the mailbox in syncing unless explicit naming is
enabled with "mail\_shared\_explicit\_inbox" set to "yes". - dsync: Shared
namespaces were not synced with "-n" flag. - dsync: Syncing shared INBOX failed
if mail\_attribute\_dict was not set. If a user has a shared mailbox
that is another user's INBOX, dsync failed to export the mailbox if
mail attributes are disabled. - fts-solr, fts-tika: Using both Solr FTS and Tika
may have caused HTTP requests to assert-crash: Panic: file http-
client-request.c: line 1232 (http\_client\_request\_send\_more): assertion
failed: (req->payload\_input != NULL) - fts-tika: 5xx errors returned by Tika
server as indexing failures. However, Tika can return 5xx for some
attachments every time. So the 5xx error should be retried once, but
treated as success if it happens on the retry as well. v2.3
regression. - fts-tika: v2.3.11 regression: Indexing messages with fts-tika may
have resulted in Panic: file message-parser.c: line 802
(message\_parser\_deinit\_from\_parts): assertion failed:
(ctx->nested\_parts\_count == 0 || i\_stream\_have\_bytes\_left(ctx->input)) - imap:
SETMETADATA could not be used to unset metadata values. Instead NIL
was handled as a "NIL" string. v2.3.14 regression. - imap: IMAP BINARY FETCH
crashes at least on empty base64 body: Panic: file index-mail-
binary.c: line 358 (blocks\_count\_lines): assertion failed:
(block\_count == 0 || block\_idx+1 == block\_count) - imap: If IMAP client using
the NOTIFY command was disconnected while sending FETCH notifications
to the client, imap could crash with Panic: Trying to close mailbox
INBOX with open transactions. - imap: Using IMAP COMPRESS extension can cause
IMAP connection to hang when IMAP commands are >8 kB long. - imapc: If
remote server sent BYE but didn't immediately disconnect, it could
cause infinite busy-loop. - lib-index: Corrupted cache record size in
dovecot.index.cache file could have caused a crash (segfault) when
accessing it. - lib-oauth2: JWT token time validation now works correctly with
32-bit systems. - lib-ssl-iostream: Checking hostnames against an SSL
certificate was case-sensitive. - lib-storage: Corrupted mime.parts in
dovecot.index.cache may have resulted in Panic: file imap-
bodystructure.c: line 206 (part\_write\_body): assertion failed: (text
== ((part->flags & MESSAGE\_PART\_FLAG\_TEXT) != 0)) - lib-storage: Index
rebuilding (e.g. via doveadm force-resync) didn't preserve the "hdr-
pop3-uidl" header. Because of this, the next pop3 session could have
accessed all of the emails' metadata to read their POP3 UIDL (opening
dbox files). - listescape: When using the listescape plugin and a shared
namespace the plugin didn't work properly anymore resulting in errors
like: "Invalid mailbox name: Name must not have '/' character." -
lmtp: Connection crashes if connection gets disconnected due to
multiple bad commands and the last bad command is BDAT. - lmtp: The Dovecot-
specific LMTP parameter XRCPTFORWARD was blindly forwarded by LMTP
proxy without checking that the backend has support. This caused a
command parameter error from the backend if it was running an older
Dovecot release. This could only occur in more complex setups where
the message was proxied twice; when the proxy generated the
XRCPTFORWARD parameter itself the problem did not occur, so this only
happened when it was forwarded. - lmtp: The LMTP proxy crashes with a panic when
the remote server replies with an error while the mail is still being
forwarded through a DATA/BDAT command. - lmtp: Username may have been
missing from lmtp log line prefixes when it was performing
autoexpunging. - master: Dovecot would incorrectly fail with haproxy 2.0.14
service checks. - master: Systemd service: Dovecot announces readiness
for accepting connections earlier than it should. The following
environment variables are now imported automatically and can be
omitted from import\_environment setting: NOTIFY\_SOCKET LISTEN\_FDS
LISTEN\_PID. - master: service { process\_min\_avail } was launching processes too
slowly when master was forking a lot of processes. - util: Make the health-
check.sh example script POSIX shell compatible.

Package        : dovecot
Version        : 1:2.3.4.1-5+deb10u7
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-33515 CVE-2022-30550

Two security issues were discovered in dovecot: IMAP and POP3 email server.

CVE-2021-33515

    The submission service in Dovecot before 2.3.15 allows STARTTLS command
    injection in lib-smtp. Sensitive information can be redirected to an
    attacker-controlled address.

CVE-2022-30550

    When two passdb configuration entries exist with the same driver and args
    settings, incorrectly applied settings can lead to an unintended security
    configuration and can permit privilege escalation in certain configurations.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:2.3.4.1-5+deb10u7.

We recommend that you upgrade your dovecot packages.

For the detailed security status of dovecot please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/dovecot>

Subject: CVE-2021-33515: Dovecot SMTP Submission service STARTTLS injection.

Open-Xchange Security Advisory 2021-06-28

Affected product: Dovecot IMAP Server
Vendor: OX Software GmbH

Internal reference: DOP-2421
Vulnerability type: Cryptographic Issues (CWE-310)
Vulnerable version: 2.3
Vulnerable component: submission
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed in 2.3.x
Researcher credits: Fabian Ising and Damian Poddebniak of MÃ¼nster University of Applied Sciences.
Vendor notification: 2021-05-21
CVE reference: CVE-2021-33515
CVSS: 4.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
Dovecot's lib-smtp is vulnerable to STARTTLS command injection. If more commands are pipelined as plaintext after STARTTLS, those commands are run inside the TLS session.

Risk:
A MiTM attacker can inject preamble commands to be executed prior to user's commands, these can be used to redirect the actual mail and other user commands to attacker controlled address.
Proof of concept script exists.

Solution:
Upgrade to fixed version, or disable STARTTLS support.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-891c1ab1ac
2021-07-05 01:35:53.935167
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : dovecot
Product : Fedora 33
Version : 2.3.15
Release : 1.fc33
URL : <http://www.dovecot.org/>
Summary : Secure imap and pop3 server
Description :
Dovecot is an IMAP server for Linux/UNIX-like systems, written with security
primarily in mind. It also contains a small POP3 server. It supports mail
in either of maildir or mbox formats.

The SQL drivers and authentication plug-ins are in their subpackages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

\* CVE-2021-29157: Dovecot does not correctly escape kid and azp fields in
JWT tokens. This may be used to supply attacker controlled keys to
validate tokens, if attacker has local access. \* CVE-2021-33515: On-path
attacker could have injected plaintext commands before STARTTLS
negotiation that would be executed after STARTTLS finished with the
client. \* Disconnection log messages are now more standardized across services.
They also always now start with "Disconnected" prefix. \* Dovecot now depends on
libsystemd for systemd integration. \* Removed support for Lua 5.2. Use version
5.1 or 5.3 instead. \* config: Some settings are now marked as "hidden". It's
discouraged to change these settings. They will no longer be visible in
doveconf output, except if they have been changed or if doveconf -s
parameter is used. See <https://doc.dovecot.org/settings/advanced/> for
details. \* imap-compress: Compression level is now algorithm specific.
See <https://doc.dovecot.org/settings/plugin/compress-plugin/> \* indexer-worker:
Convert "Indexed" info logs to an event named
"indexer\_worker\_indexing\_finished". See
[https://doc.dovecot.org/admin\_manual/list\_of\_events/#indexer-worker-indexing...](https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/#indexer-worker-indexing-)
finished + Add TSLv1.3 support to min\_protocols. + Allow configuring
ssl\_cipher\_suites. (for TLSv1.3+) + acl: Add acl\_ignore\_namespace setting which
allows to entirely ignore ACLs for the listed namespaces. + imap:
Support official RFC8970 preview/snippet syntax. Old methods of
retrieving preview information via IMAP commands ("SNIPPET and PREVIEW
with explicit algorithm selection") have been deprecated. + imapc: Support
INDEXPVT for imapc storage to enable private message flags for cluster
wide shared mailboxes. + lib-storage: Add new events: mail\_opened,
mail\_expunge\_requested, mail\_expunged, mail\_cache\_lookup\_finished. See
<https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/#mail> + zlib, imap-
compression, fs-compress: Support compression levels that the
algorithm supports. Before, we would allow hardcoded value between 1
to 9 and would default to 6. Now we allow using per-algorithm value
range and default to whatever default the algorithm specifies. - \*-login:
Commands pipelined together with and just after the authenticate
command cause these commands to be executed twice. This applies to all
protocols that involve user login, which currently comprises of imap,
pop3, submisision and managesieve. - \*-login: Processes are supposed to
disconnect the oldest non-logged in connection when process\_limit was
reached. This didn't actually happen with the default "high-security
mode" (with service\_count=1) where each connection is handled by a
separate process. - \*-login: When login process reaches client/process limits,
oldest client connections are disconnected. If one of these was still
doing anvil lookup, this caused a crash. This could happen only if the
login process limits were very low or if the server was overloaded. -
Fixed building with link time optimizations (-flto). - auth: Userdb iteration
with passwd driver does not always return all users with some nss
drivers. - dsync: Shared INBOX not synced when "mail\_shared\_explicit\_inbox" was
disabled. If a user has a shared mailbox which is another user's INBOX,
dsync didn't include the mailbox in syncing unless explicit naming is
enabled with "mail\_shared\_explicit\_inbox" set to "yes". - dsync: Shared
namespaces were not synced with "-n" flag. - dsync: Syncing shared INBOX failed
if mail\_attribute\_dict was not set. If a user has a shared mailbox
that is another user's INBOX, dsync failed to export the mailbox if
mail attributes are disabled. - fts-solr, fts-tika: Using both Solr FTS and Tika
may have caused HTTP requests to assert-crash: Panic: file http-
client-request.c: line 1232 (http\_client\_request\_send\_more): assertion
failed: (req->payload\_input != NULL) - fts-tika: 5xx errors returned by Tika
server as indexing failures. However, Tika can return 5xx for some
attachments every time. So the 5xx error should be retried once, but
treated as success if it happens on the retry as well. v2.3
regression. - fts-tika: v2.3.11 regression: Indexing messages with fts-tika may
have resulted in Panic: file message-parser.c: line 802
(message\_parser\_deinit\_from\_parts): assertion failed:
(ctx->nested\_parts\_count == 0 || i\_stream\_have\_bytes\_left(ctx->input)) - imap:
SETMETADATA could not be used to unset metadata values. Instead NIL
was handled as a "NIL" string. v2.3.14 regression. - imap: IMAP BINARY FETCH
crashes at least on empty base64 body: Panic: file index-mail-
binary.c: line 358 (blocks\_count\_lines): assertion failed:
(block\_count == 0 || block\_idx+1 == block\_count) - imap: If IMAP client using
the NOTIFY command was disconnected while sending FETCH notifications
to the client, imap could crash with Panic: Trying to close mailbox
INBOX with open transactions. - imap: Using IMAP COMPRESS extension can cause
IMAP connection to hang when IMAP commands are >8 kB long. - imapc: If
remote server sent BYE but didn't immediately disconnect, it could
cause infinite busy-loop. - lib-index: Corrupted cache record size in
dovecot.index.cache file could have caused a crash (segfault) when
accessing it. - lib-oauth2: JWT token time validation now works correctly with
32-bit systems. - lib-ssl-iostream: Checking hostnames against an SSL
certificate was case-sensitive. - lib-storage: Corrupted mime.parts in
dovecot.index.cache may have resulted in Panic: file imap-
bodystructure.c: line 206 (part\_write\_body): assertion failed: (text
== ((part->flags & MESSAGE\_PART\_FLAG\_TEXT) != 0)) - lib-storage: Index
rebuilding (e.g. via doveadm force-resync) didn't preserve the "hdr-
pop3-uidl" header. Because of this, the next pop3 session could have
accessed all of the emails' metadata to read their POP3 UIDL (opening
dbox files). - listescape: When using the listescape plugin and a shared
namespace the plugin didn't work properly anymore resulting in errors
like: "Invalid mailbox name: Name must not have '/' character." -
lmtp: Connection crashes if connection gets disconnected due to
multiple bad commands and the last bad command is BDAT. - lmtp: The Dovecot-
specific LMTP parameter XRCPTFORWARD was blindly forwarded by LMTP
proxy without checking that the backend has support. This caused a
command parameter error from the backend if it was running an older
Dovecot release. This could only occur in more complex setups where
the message was proxied twice; when the proxy generated the
XRCPTFORWARD parameter itself the problem did not occur, so this only
happened when it was forwarded. - lmtp: The LMTP proxy crashes with a panic when
the remote server replies with an error while the mail is still being
forwarded through a DATA/BDAT command. - lmtp: Username may have been
missing from lmtp log line prefixes when it was performing
autoexpunging. - master: Dovecot would incorrectly fail with haproxy 2.0.14
service checks. - master: Systemd service: Dovecot announces readiness
for accepting connections earlier than it should. The following
environment variables are now imported automatically and can be
omitted from import\_environment setting: NOTIFY\_SOCKET LISTEN\_FDS
LISTEN\_PID. - master: service { process\_min\_avail } was launching processes too
slowly when master was forking a lot of processes. - util: Make the health-
check.sh example script POSIX shell compatible.

# Security

#### Dovecot was designed since the beginning with security in mind and with many ways to provide privilege separation. Although the code is written with C, itâ€™s a little bit special C variant that makes it much more difficult to write security holes accidentally than with most other C-based projects.

#### Please see <https://www.dovecot.org/bugreport-mail> for more information how to report bugs.

Product: Dovecot
Vendor: OX Software GmbH
Internal reference: DOV-4583 (Bug ID)
Vulnerability type: CWE-74: Failure to Sanitize Data into a Different Plane ('Injection')
Vulnerable version: 2.3.0-2.3.14
Vulnerable component: submission
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Fixed version: 2.3.14.1
Vendor notification: 2021-05-21
Solution date: 2021-05-22
Public disclosure: 2021-06-21
CVE reference: CVE-2021-33515
CVSS: 4.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)
Researcher credit: Fabian Ising and Damian Poddebniak of MÃ¼nster University of Applied Sciences

Vulnerability Details:

On-path attacker could inject plaintext commands before STARTTLS negotiation that would be executed after STARTTLS finished with the client. Only the SMTP submission service is affected.

Risk:

Attacker can potentially steal user credentials and mails. The attacker needs to have sending permissions on the submission server (a valid username and password).

Workaround:

None.

Solution:

Operators should update to 2.3.14.1 or later version.

```
