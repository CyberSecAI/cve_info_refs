Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-33285

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing consistency check after reading an MFT (Master File Table) record in NTFS-3G. Specifically, the `bytes_in_use` field is not verified to be less than the `bytes_allocated` field. When this condition is not met, parsing of the records continues into memory beyond the allocated buffer causing an out-of-bounds heap buffer access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow in ntfs\_get\_attribute\_value.
- The vulnerability is a result of an incorrect check of the `bytes_in_use` field in MFT records.
- Missing bounds check on the size of data in an attribute.
- Out-of-bounds heap buffer access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory disclosure
- Denial of service
- Potential execution of arbitrary privileged code
- Escalation of privileges

**Attack vectors:**
- A local user could trigger the vulnerability with a specially crafted NTFS-formatted image.
- An attacker with physical access to an external port could trigger the vulnerability by plugging in a maliciously crafted external storage configured to use the ntfs-3g binary.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access with ntfs-3g binary having setuid-root permissions or physical access to an external port.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability resides in the function `ntfs_get_attribute_value`.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by mounting a crafted NTFS partition.
- The affected component is the NTFS-3G driver.
- The vulnerability occurs when parsing a specially crafted NTFS attribute in the MFT.
- The vulnerability was identified and fixed by upstream developers and is associated with a range of other vulnerabilities.

**Affected Software:**
-  Versions of NTFS-3G prior to 2021.8.22 are affected.
-  Affected distributions include: Red Hat, Fedora, Debian, Gentoo and SUSE.

**Other Notes:**
- A patch was released by the vendor to address the vulnerability.
