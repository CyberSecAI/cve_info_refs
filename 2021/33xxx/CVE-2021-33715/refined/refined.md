- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A race condition occurs during the parsing of specially crafted JT files, causing an object to be released before being operated on.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A race condition leads to a NULL pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could cause a Denial-of-Service condition, crashing the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by parsing specially crafted JT files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious JT file, and the user needs to open the file with the affected application. User interaction is required to open the malicious file.
