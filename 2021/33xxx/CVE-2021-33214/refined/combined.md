Remote access security
# Secure remote access to industrial equipment

Secure remote access to machines offers the benefits of industrial connectivity and protects equipment against unauthorized access and cyberthreats. HMS' Ewon solutions prioritize security, integrity, and reliability by implementing best practices to protect your information and assets.

Appropriate security measures
## Is remote access secure?

Cybersecurity is a complex issue, as threats and responses to them are constantly evolving. It is therefore crucial to use secure systems to deal with them, and to provide targeted responses depending on whether you are a machine builder, factory owner, etc.

### Q&A

##### How does Ewon's remote access solution ensure secure communications?

Ewon ensures security through compatibility with existing networks, encrypted traffic using modern protocols, and strong hardware security features. For example, Cosy+ gateways incorporate a certified secure element chip, establishing a hardware root of trust. This is one of the most advanced hardware security technology available today.

##### Are there security measures for user and device management?

Yes. Ewon's remote access solution offers centralized management (Talk2m acts as a global service, enabling you to manage all aspects of your connectivity in one single place). It provides multi-factor authentication as well as an audit trail of connections for traceability. Every component of the remote connectivity remains under your control.

##### Are Ewon remote solutions always up to date with the latest security measures?

Ewon works closely with an independent cybersecurity company, NVISO, to ensure its remote access solution is constantly adapating to the evolving security landscape.

# eCatcher Desktop, Version 6.6.4 Advisory

By:
[Priyank Nigam, Senior Security Consultant](https://bishopfox.com/authors/priyank-nigam)

![Gauge with medium severity reading for FlowscreenComponents Basepack, Version 3.0.7 Advisory. Mautic Version <=3.2.2 Advisory. eCatcher Desktop, Version 6.6.4 Advisory.](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Images/channels/blog/advisories-risk-level/Medium-Risk-Advisory-Featured.jpg)

## eCatcher Advisory Summary

An insecure filesystem permissions vulnerability was identified in eCatcher version 6.6.4 and earlier. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have a user account on the same machine as the victim and have access to the machine during an active VPN connection.

### Medium Risk Level Impact

Weak filesystem permissions could allow malicious users to access files that could lead to sensitive information disclosure, modification of configuration files, or disruption of normal system operation.

### Affected Vendor

| **Product Vendor** | Product Name | Affected Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ewon by HMS Networks | eCatcher | Version 6.6.4 and earlier |

### Product Description:

According to the official product description, eCatcher is a “remote access software that allows remote management of devices within a highly secure environment”. The project’s official website is <https://www.ewon.biz/technical-support/pages/talk2m/talk2m-tools/talk2m-ecatcher>. The latest version of the application is 6.7.3, released on July 7, 2021.

### Vulnerabilities List:

One vulnerability was identified within the eCatcher Desktop application.

[INSECURE FILESYSTEM PERMISSIONS](#Insecure-filesystem-permissions)The vulnerabilities are described in the sections below.

### Solution

Update to version 6.7.3

## VULNERABILITIES

### INSECURE FILESYSTEM PERMISSIONS

| **CVE ID** | **Security Risk** | **Impact** | **Access Vector** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2021-33214](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33214) | Medium | Escalation of privileges | Local |

Files and directories for the eCatcher Talk2MVpnService service have permissions that do not properly enforce access controls. For example, sensitive configuration files are marked as world-writable. Since this service runs under the NT Authority\SYSTEM user, these excessive permissions could lead to privilege escalation on the server.

The directory permissions for the temp directory used by the Talk2MVpnService service were enumerated as follows:

```
PS C:\Users\pn> icacls "C:\Program Files (x86)\eCatcher-Talk2M\Talk2mVpnService\temp"
C:\Program Files (x86)\eCatcher-Talk2M\Talk2mVpnService\temp
       BUILTIN\Users:(F)
       BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
       NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(I)(F)
       NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(I)(CI)(IO)(F)
       NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
       NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
       BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
       BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
       BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)
       BUILTIN\Users:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
       CREATOR OWNER:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
       APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)         APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
```

FIGURE 1 - Full directory access to all users of the system

As highlighted above, all users have full read/write rights over the directory. Since this directory is used to temporarily write OpenVPN configuration files, a user or malware on the system that replaces it successfully could perform privilege escalation when the privileged openvpn process reads it. The `Talk2MVpnService` service recreates this configuration file each time the VPN connection is initiated and prepends the filename with a random UUID, making it unpredictable. Hence, the attack window for exploitation was approximately 15 ms, which made the working exploit unreliable.
