- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `parseUri()` function within `src/http/httpLib.c`. When a HTTP request lacks a valid Host header, both `rx->hostHeader` and `stream->host` can be null pointers. This leads to a null pointer dereference when trying to access `stream->host->name`, causing the program to crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Null pointer dereference vulnerability in the `parseUri()` function.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation results in a denial-of-service by causing the appweb server to crash.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request without a valid Host header to the vulnerable server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. This could be from the same network or from the internet if the server is exposed.
