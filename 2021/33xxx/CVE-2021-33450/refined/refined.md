Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33450:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `nasm_calloc()` function within the `nasmlib/alloc.c` file of NASM (Netwide Assembler).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory Leak: The `nasm_calloc()` function allocates memory but fails to release it under certain conditions, leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Repeated exploitation of the memory leak can exhaust available memory, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a crafted file, meaning the attacker needs local access to run the assembler on the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to run NASM with a specially crafted input file. The attacker would need to have local access to the system running the vulnerable version of NASM.
- The crafted input file is available at [https://github.com/Clingto/POC/blob/master/MSA/nasm/nasm-nasm\_calloc-1255](https://github.com/Clingto/POC/blob/master/MSA/nasm/nasm-nasm_calloc-1255).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported using AddressSanitizer which reported:
    -  Direct leak of 2816 byte(s) in 16 object(s)
    -  Direct leak of 48 byte(s) in 12 object(s)
    -  Indirect leak of 18816 byte(s) in 450 object(s)
