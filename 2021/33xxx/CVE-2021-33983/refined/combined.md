| in parser.c k seems like the size of the rest of buffer on stack(var 'buf' which type is char[]). n is memcpy size as 3rd para. `while` condition k>0 to keep buffer is not full. if enter in `if(k<n)` branch `n=k`,var n is assigned the value of k then `k -=n` ,var k is assigned the value 0 then `--k`, var k is assigned the value 0xffffffffffffffff while var k's type is size\_t. so the while condition`k > 0` not make sense. next memcpy will lead to stack overflow  ``` void error_ref_sym(fb_parser_t *P, fb_ref_t *ref, const char *msg, fb_symbol_t *s2) {     fb_ref_t *p;     char buf[FLATCC_MAX_IDENT_SHOW + 1];     size_t k = FLATCC_MAX_IDENT_SHOW;     size_t n = 0;     size_t n0 = 0;     p = ref;     while (p && k > 0) {         n = (size_t)p->ident->len;         if (k < n) {             n = k;         }         memcpy(buf + n0, p->ident->text, n);         k -= n;         n0 += n;         buf[n0] = '.';         --k; //overflow here when k = 0         ++n0;         p = p->link;     }     buf[n0] = '\0';     if (n0 > 0) {         --n0;     }     if (k <= 0) {         memcpy(buf + FLATCC_MAX_IDENT_SHOW + 1 - 4, "...\0", 4);         n0 = FLATCC_MAX_IDENT_SHOW;     }     error_report(P, ref->ident, msg, s2 ? s2->ident : 0, buf, n0); } ```  poc:  ``` ➜  fuzz_test cat test9 struct tsj{         damage:shortllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllve.tlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll; } ➜  fuzz_test ../flatcc/bin/flatcc test9 test9:2:9: error: 'shortlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll.tlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll': unknown type reference used with struct field: test9:2:2: 'damage' *** stack smashing detected ***: terminated [1]    3685 abort (core dumped)  ../flatcc/bin/flatcc test9 ➜  fuzz_test  ```  ``` ➜  fuzz_test gdb ../flatcc/bin/flatcc GNU gdb (Ubuntu 9.2-0ubuntu1~20.04) 9.2 Copyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

| I think there are more problems. The assignment of '.' might be outside the buffer. `--k` accounts for the `.`. EDIT: no, there is one extra space reserved for that. |

| ~~it seems not solve memcpy's copy overflow actually the stack overflow happens on the next loop after truncated in my opinion just mod `while (p && k>0)` to `while(p && k>0 && k<0x8000000000000000)`~~ EDIT: sorry for mistake. it seems ok for solving it. |

| Sorry, but your suggestion is not good because it depends on the integer size.  The following was written before your last EDIT, FYI. So I will close here.  Why do you think an overflow still happens? Does your test still fail?  The invariant is that k is what is left in the buffer. In the new version, k > 0 on entry. If '.' is added, k could become zero. However, n will not be larger than k when entering memcpy, so worst case, 0 bytes are copied, which will not result in a buffer overrun. At least as I understand it.  The compiler could have warned that the test <= 0 does not make sense. There are many other places where the compiler warns even if the code actually makes sense.  It's getting late, so I'll continue tomorrow if you have some suggestions. |
