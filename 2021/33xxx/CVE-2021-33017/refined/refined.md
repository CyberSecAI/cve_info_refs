The provided content is related to CVE-2021-33017.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel. The standard access path of the affected product requires authentication, but an alternate path or channel exists that does not require authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel (CWE-288).

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker unauthorized access to the IntelliBridge EC40 and 80 Hub, which may enable them to execute software, modify system configurations, or view/update files, including potentially unidentifiable patient data.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is adjacent network access (AV:A), the attack complexity is low (AC:L), no privileges are required (PR:N), and no user interaction is required (UI:N), with no scope change (S:U) .

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be positioned on the same network as the vulnerable device. The advisory states, "These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely."
