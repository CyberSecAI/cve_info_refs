- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application generates verbose error messages that disclose sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information exposure through error messages (CWE-209).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Disclosure of sensitive information, such as full file paths.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, possibly by triggering errors through malformed requests or specific application interactions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any privileges and does not require user interaction.
