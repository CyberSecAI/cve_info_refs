The content is related to CVE-2021-33304.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A double free vulnerability exists in the `pico_fragments_reassemble` function of picoTCP.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double free: The `pico_frame_discard` function is called twice on the same memory location, leading to a double free.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A double free can lead to memory corruption, which could result in denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specific sequence of fragmented network packets that cause `pico_transport_receive` to return an error (-1) in the default case of a switch statement. This return triggers the double free in `pico_fragments_reassemble` when `pico_frame_discard` is called twice.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to send network packets that would result in the described sequence of events leading to the double free in `pico_fragments_reassemble`. This means the attacker needs network access to a vulnerable system running the affected picoTCP version.
