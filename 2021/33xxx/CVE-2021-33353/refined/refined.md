{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Magento 2 Help Desk extension from Wyomind is vulnerable to stored XSS, directory traversal, and unrestricted upload of a dangerous file type. These vulnerabilities can be chained to achieve code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): A malicious XSS payload can be injected through the ticket message from the frontend. This payload is triggered when an administrator views the ticket in the Magento 2 backend.",
      "Directory Traversal: The attachment directory can be set to a path outside the intended directory using directory traversal sequences such as `../../../pub`.",
       "Unrestricted File Upload: The extension allows uploading dangerous file types like `phar` by adding it to the list of allowed extensions."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities leads to remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can inject arbitrary code into the Magento 2 application by uploading a malicious phar file to a publicly accessible directory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
       "1. Injecting XSS payload via ticket messages from the front-end.  The XSS payload is crafted to modify the configuration of the application.",
       "2. Modifying extension settings via the injected XSS to enable file attachments, add 'phar' to the allowed file extensions, and set the attachment directory using directory traversal to a publicly accessible directory.",
       "3. Uploading a malicious phar file as an attachment to a ticket message.",
       "4. Triggering the execution of the uploaded phar file by requesting it via a crafted URL."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a ticket through the front-end of the application. Then, they need to be able to exploit the XSS vulnerability, which allows them to modify the extension settings. Finally, they need to upload a malicious phar file and access it through the browser to trigger the RCE.",
