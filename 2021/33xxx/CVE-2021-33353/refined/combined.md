Help Desk for Magento 2 is an extension that will make the interactions with your customers much easier and help you to create a relationship based on trust.

When facing any kind of issue, your customers will be able to create a ticket directly from their account to receive support from your team. They'll have the possibility to add CC email addresses as well as attachments to make their requests very clear.

Your support team will be able to assign the incoming tickets to any member. Each ticket includes the previous messages and the orders history. Depending on their permissions, team members can assign tags, priority and change the status of the messages.

Customers, as well as the support team, will receive an email notification each time a new message or answer will be sent.

Pre-sales informations

Magento® Open Source vs Magento® Commerce vs Magento® Commerce Cloud

Magento offers three variations of its product.

As their names have changed over the past few years, here is a recap:

* **Magento Open Source**: previously Magento Community Edition (CE), is a free and non-hosted e-commerce platform.
* **Magento Commerce**: previously Magento Enterprise (EE), is the paid version of Magento and offers support services.
* **Magento Commerce Cloud**: is the paid version of Magento and offers support and hosting services.

License and domains

License validity

**A license is valid for an unlimited period of time on one single installation**

* If you're using more than one installation, you will have to buy a separate license for each instance.
* if you're running several domains on a same installation, you will need only one license for all of them.

Although your license doesn’t have a limited period of validity, your Support & Upgrade period does. By purchasing a module, you’ll be granted a 12-month support period for free. Passed this period, you will have to pay for a new one (see FAQ: [Extend your Support period](https://www.wyomind.com/magento2/faq.html?section=faq#_extend-your-support-period))

Domains pre-registration

You can **pre-register your live domain to your license**in advance.

Thanks to this option, you'll be able to get the module ready to use on your domain before it goes live.

To pre-register your production domain:

1. Go to:
2. Click on the **Settings** icon next to the module you want your domain to pre-register on.
3. Click on the link at the bottom of the page saying:
   Do you want to pre-register your domain in order to be ready to go live?
   [![](https://www.wyomind.com/pub/media/extensions/faqs/magento-2/wyomind-preregister.png)](https://www.wyomind.com/pub/media/extensions/faqs/magento-2/wyomind-preregister.png)
4. Finally, enter your domain name and click on pre-register now .
   [![](https://www.wyomind.com/pub/media/extensions/faqs/magento-2/wyomind-preregister-popup.png)](https://www.wyomind.com/pub/media/extensions/faqs/magento-2/wyomind-preregister-popup.png)

Attention, this doesn't mean your license is activated. You'll still have to [activate](https://www.wyomind.com/magento2/faq.html?section=faq#_extensions-activation-from-the-back-office-of-magento) it on your new domain when the module is installed.

Testing environments

One license is valid for an unlimited period of time on one installation only. However, it is possible to extend or transfer your license in 2 cases:

* If you would like to add your**testing environments** to your license.
  In that case, it is possible to *extend your license* to an unlimited number of domains for free.
  For *mywebsite-staging.com or mywebsite-dev.com*
* If you want to transfer your license to another live domain.
  In that case, the Support & Upgrade period for your license must still be active.

To be able to use Help Desk on both your production and testing environments, follow the instructions below:

1. Download Help Desk.
   (see FAQ: [Extensions download](https://www.wyomind.com/magento2/faq.html?section=faq#_extensions-download-))
2. Install Help Desk on your environment.
   (see FAQ: Modules installation [in Magento](https://www.wyomind.com/woocommerce/faq.html?section=faq#plugin-installation-from-the-woocommerce-back-office) or [in WooCommerce](https://www.wyomind.com/woocommerce/faq.html?section=faq#plugin-installation-from-the-woocommerce-back-office))
3. Activate the license.
   (see FAQ: Licenses activation [in Magento](https://www.wyomind.com/woocommerce/faq.html?section=faq#license-activation) or [in WooCommerce](https://www.wyomind.com/woocommerce/faq.html?section=faq#license-activation))

To uninstall Help Desk, start with disabling the extension running the following command:

```
bin/magento module:disable Wyomind_HelpDesk

6. Copy and paste the**license code** in the**License code** field from your admin or simply click on Activate now! [![](https://www.wyomind.com/pub/media/extensions/faqs/magento-2/magento-2-activation-final.png)

7. Finally, refresh your cache, log out and log in back straight after, to complete the installation*.*

When the extension includes other modules, repeat the steps described above for each one, using the corresponding activation keys (each module has its own activation key).

**Add another domain to your license**

 To activate the license on another domain (test, staging...):

1. Once the extension is installed on the new domain, copy your activation key in:
    StoresConfigurationWyomind Your extension
2. After having saved the configuration, a notification appears. Click on **Add this domain to my license**.

   **[![](https://www.wyomind.com/pub/media/extensions/faqs/magento-1/magento-1-request-free-transfer.png)](https://www.wyomind.com/pub/media/extensions/faqs/magento-1/magento-1-request-free-transfer.png)**
3. A **transfer request will then be sent** to our team within an hour.
    Once the request is taken care of, you will receive a confirmation email.
    If your transfer request is accepted, you can use Help Desk on both environments at the same time.

Note that the order in which you activate your license on your domains does not matter. You can start with your staging/dev/local environment or with your live domain, the process will be the same.

Also, if you have loads of staging domains, or if you are an agency managing load of domains for your customers, please contact us so that we can automatically whitelist these domains.

Extensions activation from the CLI

Once Help Desk is installed, you have to activate the license.

For this, you can use the below command line (change the Activation key with the corresponding value):

```
bin/magento wyomind:license:activate Wyomind_HelpDesk <YOUR_ACTIVATION_KEY>
```

To retrieve the list of all the available modules as well as the licenses status, please use:

```
bin/magento wyomind:license:status
```

Among the different status, you can find:

* **registered** = your license is registered
* **pending** = you need to run the activation command line
* **invalidated** = the license has been invalidated due to a wrong activation key or a license infringement

To activate several licenses at the same time, use:

```
bin/magento wyomind:license:activate \
Wyomind_Extension1,Wyomind_Extension2 \
ACTIVATION_KEY_1,ACTIVATION_KEY_2
```

or:

```
bin/magento wyomind:license:activate \
Extension1,Extension2 \
ACTIVATION_KEY_1,ACTIVATION_KEY_2
```

In the case where it is required to connect remotely or via a virtual desktop, the operation will only be carried out via Teamviewer and will be charged on the basis of Wyomind current hourly rate.

After the XSS payload is executed, it is possible to upload a phar file by attaching files to ticket messages. Upon successful upload, the uploaded files can be requested to trigger the execution of it by requesting

https://[HOSTNAME]/<ticketId>/<messageId>/filename.phar

ticketId and messageId can be identified after sending the ticket message with the attached phar file. The ticketId is visible in the
URL, for example:

https://[HOSTNAME]/helpdesk/customer/ticket_view/ticket_id/7/

and the messageId can be identified by hovering over the uploaded file link which will be similar to

https://[HOSTNAME]/helpdesk/customer/message_downloadAttachment/message/40/file/filename.phar

in this case, the messageId is 40.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
