- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure default variable initialization in Intel(R) RealSense(TM) ID Solution F450 firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from insecure default variable initialization, potentially allowing unintended access or modification of sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated user with physical access could potentially achieve information disclosure and privilege escalation
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have physical access to the Intel RealSense ID Solution F450. User interaction (UI) is required. The attack has high complexity.
