Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33364:

**1. Vulnerability Confirmation:**

*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 5411-1) explicitly lists **CVE-2021-33364** as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in the `gpac` package. This confirms the relevance of the provided information to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The provided information indicates the vulnerability is a **memory leak** within the `MP4Box def_parent_box_new` function. This is further supported by the github issue title "memory leak in MP4Box def\_parent\_box\_new #1783". The commit message confirms that the fix addresses a bug reported from a fuzz test.
*   The commit `fe5155c` includes a fix within the file `src/isomedia/isom_intern.c`, specifically adding `gf_isom_box_del(a);` before the `break;` statement in a code block dealing with movie box parsing. This implies that the `a` variable, likely holding a reference to an allocated memory location, was not being freed before the loop was exited.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The core weakness is a **memory leak** in the `def_parent_box_new` function related to parsing MP4 boxes, specifically when processing movie boxes. The un-freed memory could potentially lead to exhaustion.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The vulnerability leads to a **denial-of-service** condition by consuming available memory. An attacker can trigger this repeatedly and eventually exhaust system memory, making the application or system unstable or unusable.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through crafting a malicious **MP4 file** that, when parsed by `gpac`, will trigger the memory leak in the vulnerable function.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted MP4 file to a vulnerable application or system using the `gpac` library.
*   No specific attacker position is mentioned, it can be assumed that the attacker can be local or remote depending on the application using `gpac`

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-33364 is a memory leak vulnerability in the `gpac` library, specifically within the `MP4Box def_parent_box_new` function. By crafting a malicious MP4 file, an attacker can trigger this memory leak during parsing, leading to denial-of-service by exhausting available memory. The fix involves adding code to free allocated resources before the loop is exited, preventing the memory leak.
