**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the Vigilant Centerium Dashboard. Specifically, the dashboard is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This means that user-supplied input is not properly neutralized before being included in the generated web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page through a GET parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker can inject JavaScript in a GET parameter of HTTP requests, which can lead to stealing internal information.
- **Actions in User Context:**  The injected script can perform actions within the context of an authenticated user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** The attack is network-based and can be initiated remotely.
- **Malicious URL:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the JavaScript payload, which is then sent to a victim.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to click on the malicious link for the attack to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via a network connection.
- **Crafted malicious URL:** The attacker needs to create a URL that includes the malicious JavaScript.
- **User interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking a malicious link.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable component is the Vigilant Centerium Dashboard.
- The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 5.4 with a vector string of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to steal sensitive information or perform actions as an authenticated user, if successful.
