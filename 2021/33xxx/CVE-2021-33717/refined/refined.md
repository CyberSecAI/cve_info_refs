- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A NULL pointer dereference condition exists when parsing specially crafted CGM files. This is due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476).
- **Impact of exploitation**: The application crashes and must be restarted to restore service, leading to a Denial-of-Service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: By opening a specially crafted CGM file with the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious CGM file. The attacker needs to have the ability to create a malicious CGM file.
