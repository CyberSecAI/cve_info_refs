SUMMARY

Siemens has released version V13.2.0.1 for JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization to ﬁx multiple vulner-
abilities that could be triggered when the products read ﬁles in different ﬁle formats (CGM, DGN, DXF,
and DWG). If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with the affected products, this could lead the
application to crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.

Siemens recommends to update to the latest versions and to limit opening of untrusted ﬁles from unknown
sources in the affected products.

• Avoid to open untrusted ﬁles from unknown sources in JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

JT2Go is a 3D JT viewing tool to allow users to view JT, PDF, Solid Edge, PLM XML with available JT,
VFZ, CGM, and TIF data.

Teamcenter Visualization software enables enterprises to enhance their product lifecycle management
(PLM) environment with a comprehensive family of visualization solutions. The software enables enter-
prise users to access documents, 2D drawings and 3D models in a single environment.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-32936

An out-of-bounds write issue exists in the DXF ﬁle-recovering procedure in the Open Design Alliance
Drawings SDK (All versions prior to 2022.4) resulting from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied
data. This can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer and allow attackers to cause a
denial-of-service condition or execute code in the context of the current process.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-32938

Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK (All versions prior to 2022.4) are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds
read due to parsing of DWG ﬁles resulting from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.
This can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer and allows attackers to cause a denial-of
service condition or read sensitive information from memory.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-32940

An out-of-bounds read issue exists in the DWG ﬁle-recovering procedure in the Open Design Alliance
Drawings SDK (All versions prior to 2022.4) resulting from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied
data. This can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer and allow attackers to cause a
denial-of-service condition or read sensitive information from memory locations.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-32944

A use-after-free issue exists in the DGN ﬁle-reading procedure in the Open Design Alliance Drawings
SDK (All versions prior to 2022.4) resulting from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.
This can result in a memory corruption or arbitrary code execution, allowing attackers to cause a

Vulnerability CVE-2021-32948

An out-of-bounds write issue exists in the DWG ﬁle-reading procedure in the Open Design Alliance
Drawings SDK (All versions prior to 2022.4) resulting from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied
data. This can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer and allow attackers to cause a

Vulnerability CVE-2021-32950

An out-of-bounds read issue exists within the parsing of DXF ﬁles in the Open Design Alliance
Drawings SDK (All versions prior to 2022.4) resulting from the lack of proper validation of user-
supplied data. This can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer and allows attackers to
cause a denial-of-service condition or read sensitive information from memory locations.
