Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33622:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect fallback mechanism in SingularityPRO when a custom remote endpoint is configured for retrieving container images using `library://` URIs. If the custom remote endpoint is unavailable or returns an invalid response, SingularityPRO incorrectly falls back to the default `cloud.sylabs.io` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Fallback:** The primary weakness is the fallback to the default remote endpoint when the configured custom remote is unreachable or unresponsive. This bypasses the user's intended configuration.
*   **URI Spoofing:** An attacker can potentially exploit this by pushing a malicious container to the default remote endpoint using the same URI that a victim is using with a non-default remote endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If the user's custom remote is inaccessible, they may inadvertently execute a malicious container from the default endpoint, leading to arbitrary code execution on their system.
*   **Compromised System:** Execution of malicious code can result in system compromise, data breaches, and other security issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the accessibility of the custom remote endpoint. This could be achieved through various methods like network outages or malicious attacks targeting the custom remote service.
*   **URI Spoofing:** The attacker must also be able to push a malicious container image with the same URI to the default `cloud.sylabs.io` endpoint.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack relies on a user attempting to run a container using a `library://` URI while their configured custom remote is inaccessible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Custom Remote Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the URI that the target user is attempting to use with a custom remote endpoint.
*   **Access to Default Registry:** The attacker needs to have the ability to push a container image to the default `cloud.sylabs.io` registry.
*   **Ability to Cause Custom Endpoint Inaccessibility:** The attacker would benefit from being able to make the victim's custom remote endpoint inaccessible. This could be through a network attack or by targeting the remote endpoint directly.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects SingularityPRO versions prior to 3.5-8.
*   The issue also exists in open-source Singularity versions 3.5.x and 3.6.x but they are no longer supported and will not receive patches.
*   The advisory explicitly distinguishes this issue from CVE-2021-32635 (GHSA-5mv9-q7fq-9394), as this one specifically covers the fallback behavior when a custom remote endpoint is unavailable.
*   Users interacting only with the default remote endpoint are not affected, and installations using execution control lists configured with secure keys are also not affected.
