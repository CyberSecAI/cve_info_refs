    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2021-33646",
      "root_cause": "Memory leak in the `th_read()` function of libtar. Specifically, when processing GNU long name extensions, the code allocates memory for `t->th_buf.gnu_longname` but doesn't free it after use.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory Leak"
      ],
      "impact": "The memory leak could lead to resource exhaustion if an attacker can provide a specially crafted tar archive with a large number of long name extensions, potentially causing a denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker could provide a malicious tar archive to a vulnerable application using libtar.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to supply an archive to an application using libtar.",
       "additional_details": "This vulnerability is related to CVE-2021-33645, which also addresses a memory leak in `th_read()` function of libtar and is fixed in the same update. The fix for this CVE was later found to have introduced new use-after-free issues CVE-2021-33640 and was corrected in a later release. "
