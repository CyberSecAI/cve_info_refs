- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute malicious JavaScript code by tricking users into accessing a malicious link. This could lead to the compromise of user accounts, redirection to malicious websites, and other client-side attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can craft a malicious link containing JavaScript code and trick a user into clicking it.
