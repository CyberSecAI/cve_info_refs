**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command within the hostname functionality of Weidmueller Industrial WLAN devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is OS Command Injection (CWE-78). A specially crafted entry to network configuration information can trigger the execution of arbitrary system commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain full control of the vulnerable device by executing arbitrary system commands. This can lead to complete compromise of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send various requests to the device to trigger the command injection vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated as a high-privilege user to exploit this vulnerability.
