Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33265:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `FUN_80046eb4` function, specifically in the `/formSetPortTr` page of the D-Link DIR-809 router's firmware.
*   The `get_var` function extracts user-controlled input from an HTTP request, specifically the value associated with keys of the format `sched_name_%d`.
*   The extracted string (`pcVar2`) is then copied to a stack buffer (`local_1c4`) using `strcpy` without any length validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic stack buffer overflow due to the use of `strcpy` on a user-controlled input without any size checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the router's system, potentially leading to complete device compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/formSetPortTr.htm` endpoint.
*   **Manipulated Input:** The attacker controls the content of the `sched_name_%d` parameters in the POST request, using a long string to overflow the stack buffer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface, which is typically accessible on the local network.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests with specific content.

**Additional Details:**

*   The specific firmware version vulnerable is `DIR-809Ax_FW1.12WWB03_20190410`.
*   The Proof of Concept (PoC) is provided within the content
* The vulnerability has been confirmed by the vendor

In summary, CVE-2021-33265 is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the D-Link DIR-809 router, which can be exploited through a crafted HTTP POST request to achieve arbitrary code execution.
