Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `sub_80046EB4` function within the `/formSetPortTr` page of the D-Link DIR-809 router's firmware. The `get_var` function extracts user-controlled input from an HTTP request, and the extracted string is then copied to a stack buffer using `strcpy` without any bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow. The `strcpy` function copies the attacker-controlled input `inputPortRng_%d` into a fixed-size stack buffer without validating the input length, allowing an attacker to write beyond the buffer's boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By overflowing the stack, an attacker can overwrite return addresses and other critical data, potentially gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code on the router's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/formSetPortTr.htm` page.
- **Specifically crafted `inputPortRng_%d` parameter:** The attacker provides an overly long string for the `inputPortRng_%d` parameter in the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router. This could be achieved by being on the same local network as the router or, potentially, by exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain remote access.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker must know about the vulnerable parameter `inputPortRng_%d` in the specified request.

**Additional Information**
- **Affected Firmware:** The vulnerability affects the firmware version `DIR-809Ax_FW1.12WWB03_20190410`.
- **Vendor Confirmation:** The vulnerability has been confirmed by the vendor (D-Link).
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** A PoC HTTP request is provided demonstrating how to trigger the stack overflow by sending a long string for the `inputPortRng_0` parameter.
- **Acknowledgement:** The report acknowledges the work of researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and TIANGONG Team of Legendsec at Qi'anxin Group.
