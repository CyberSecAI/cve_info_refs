Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `manage_custom_field_edit_page.php` file.
*   The `return` parameter, which is intended to redirect the user after an action, was not properly sanitized.
*   The `strip_tags` function was used to sanitize the input, but this was insufficient to prevent XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application was vulnerable to reflected XSS due to the unsanitized output of the `return` parameter.
*   The `return` parameter value is output directly into an HTML hidden input field, specifically:
    ```html
    <input type="hidden" name="return" value="<?php echo $f_return ?>" />
    ```
*   The `strip_tags` function did not remove attributes, allowing an attacker to inject malicious attributes such as `accesskey`, `onclick`, and `autofocus`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the hidden input field.
*   By convincing a user to perform a specific action (e.g., pressing a certain key combination or visiting a crafted URL), the attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
*   This could lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, cookie stealing, redirecting users to malicious websites, or defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker would need to craft a malicious URL containing the vulnerable `return` parameter with the malicious JavaScript payload
*   The attacker needs to entice a user to visit this malicious link.
* The attacker would exploit the ability to inject HTML attributes into the hidden field.
*  An attacker could use the `accesskey`, `onclick`, and `autofocus` attributes to trigger the execution of javascript. For example, with  `accesskey="Y" onclick="alert(1)" autofocus="`, the alert would fire when Alt + Shift + Y are pressed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with malicious payloads.
*   The attacker needs to be able to persuade a user to access that malicious URL.
*  No privileged access is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Feras AL-KASSAR (SAP)
*   The fix involved using `string_attribute()` to properly escape the output of the `return` parameter before rendering it in the HTML.
*   The issue was fixed in MantisBT version 2.25.2.
*  The 'return' parameter was deemed a leftover from an old change and was removed in another related ticket but was reintroduced.
