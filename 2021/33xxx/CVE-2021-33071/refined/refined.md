Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect default permissions in the installer for the Intel(R) oneAPI Rendering Toolkit.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The installer sets insecure default permissions, which can be exploited by a local user.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated local user can potentially escalate their privileges.
*   **Attack vectors**: Local access is required.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   Attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
    *   Attacker needs to have local access to the system.

**Additional details from the document:**

*   The vulnerability affects Intel® oneAPI Rendering Toolkit versions prior to 2021.2.
*   The vulnerability is rated as MEDIUM severity with a CVSS base score of 6.7.
*   The CVSS vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H which translates to:
    *   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local)**
    *   **AC:H (Attack Complexity: High)**
    *   **PR:L (Privileges Required: Low)**
    *  **UI:R (User Interaction: Required)**
    *   **S:U (Scope: Unchanged)**
    *   **C:H (Confidentiality Impact: High)**
    *   **I:H (Integrity Impact: High)**
    *   **A:H (Availability Impact: High)**
*   The recommended mitigation is to update the Intel® oneAPI Rendering Toolkit to version 2021.2 or later.
