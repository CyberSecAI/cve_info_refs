{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A NULL pointer dereference occurs in the `expand_mmac_params()` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL Pointer Dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service due to application crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted assembly file with the yasm assembler."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted assembly file as input to the yasm assembler. This can be done locally or remotely if the application is processing user-provided assembly files.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs in the `expand_mmac_params()` function within the `modules/preprocs/nasm/nasm-pp.c` file, which is part of the yasm assembler's NASM preprocessor module. The vulnerable code attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, leading to a crash."
