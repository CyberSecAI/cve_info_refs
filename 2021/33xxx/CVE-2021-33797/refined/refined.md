Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-33797:

**Root Cause:**
- Integer overflow in the `exp` variable within the `js_strtod` function located in `jsdtoa.c`. Specifically, the exponent parsing logic in lines 694-696 of the `jsdtoa.c` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow: The exponent `exp` is calculated by repeatedly multiplying by 10 and adding the next digit. When a large exponent is parsed, this calculation can overflow, wrapping around to a negative value.
- Optimized-out check: Due to compiler optimization (-O2 flag in gcc), the intended check `if (exp < -maxExponent)` is removed leading to an incorrect value of 'exp' that causes a subsequent loop to execute excessively.
- Buffer overflow: The excessive execution of the loop starting at line 727 in `jsdtoa.c`, caused by the incorrect `exp` value, leads to an out-of-bounds write on the global variable `futurewords`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Global buffer overflow: An attacker can trigger a global buffer overflow, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution if exploited further. The AddressSanitizer output shows the overflow occurring when writing near the 'futurewords' global variable.
- Denial of Service: The vulnerability can cause the application to crash due to a buffer overflow, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Input string: The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted string to be converted to a floating-point number by the `js_strtod` function (e.g. a large exponent like `1E9600000000000000000000000000`).
- JavaScript code: The provided POC (`Function(1E9600000000000000000000000000)`) shows the vulnerability can be triggered by a large number in JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the affected `js_strtod` function. This can occur through the loading of a malicious javascript program that contains the crafted input, as shown in the provided Proof of Concept.
- No special privileges or user interaction are needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of MuJS between 1.0.1 and 1.1.1.
- The issue is caused by an integer overflow in the exponent parsing logic in `jsdtoa.c`.
- A fix has been implemented by adding an explicit overflow check (limiting exponent parsing to `INT_MAX`) in the commit `833b6f1`.
- The fix prevents the signed overflow from misbehaving due to over-eager optimizing compilers.
- The vulnerability was assigned a critical severity CVSS score of 9.8.
- The vulnerability is tracked by CVE-2021-33797 and GHSA-cm79-jwwm-5h7h.
