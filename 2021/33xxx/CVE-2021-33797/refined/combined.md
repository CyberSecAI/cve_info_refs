| In jsdtoa.c:694-696,  ``` 694   while ((*p >= '0') && (*p <= '9')) { 695       exp = exp * 10 + (*p - '0'); 696       p += 1; 697    }  ```  there is an integer overflow in variable `exp`. The number `1E9600000000000000000000000000` is parsed into `0x80000000`, which causes the for loop in jsdtoa.c:727-730 being executed dozens of times. Because `-O2` in compile args, the `if (exp < -maxExponent)` branch has been optimised out by gcc.  poc:  ``` Function(1E9600000000000000000000000000)  ```  compile args:  ``` CC=/usr/bin/gcc make release  ```  AddressSanitizer output:  ``` ==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: global-buffer-overflow on address 0x000000690638 at pc 0x00000040af2f bp 0x7ffdaa557c60 sp 0x7ffdaa557c50 READ of size 8 at 0x000000690638 thread T0     #0 0x40af2e in js_strtod /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsdtoa.c:729     #1 0x436da2 in lexnumber /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jslex.c:383     #2 0x42564b in jsY_lexx /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jslex.c:605     #3 0x467fe4 in jsY_lex /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jslex.c:742     #4 0x467fe4 in jsP_next /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:140     #5 0x467fe4 in callexp /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:425     #6 0x467fe4 in postfix /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:432     #7 0x467fe4 in unary /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:453     #8 0x468cd8 in multiplicative /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:460     #9 0x468fe8 in additive /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:475     #10 0x469268 in shift /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:489     #11 0x46958b in relational /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:504     #12 0x469a6b in equality /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:522     #13 0x469e2a in bitand /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:538     #14 0x46a04a in bitxor /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:552     #15 0x46a26b in bitor /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:566     #16 0x46a26b in logand /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:580     #17 0x46a5b0 in logor /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:592     #18 0x46a74b in conditional /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:604     #19 0x46a74b in assignment /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:620     #20 0x46ba3a in expression /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:641     #21 0x428651 in statement /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:906     #22 0x429a62 in script /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:942     #23 0x429d08 in jsP_parse /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsparse.c:1049     #24 0x429d97 in js_loadstringx /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsstate.c:113     #25 0x434c85 in js_loadstring /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsstate.c:128     #26 0x434c85 in js_loadfile /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsstate.c:188     #27 0x45f252 in js_dofile /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsstate.c:217     #28 0x40256e in main /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/main.c:354     #29 0x7f88433ab83f in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x2083f)     #30 0x402b78 in _start (/data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/build/sanitize/mujs+0x402b78)  0x000000690638 is located 8 bytes to the left of global variable 'futurewords' defined in 'jscompile.c:35:20' (0x690640) of size 56 0x000000690638 is located 48 bytes to the right of global variable 'strictfuturewords' defined in 'jscompile.c:39:20' (0x6905c0) of size 72 SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: global-buffer-overflow /data/clean/mujs-1.1.1/jsdtoa.c:729 in js_strtod Shadow bytes around the buggy address:   0x0000800ca070: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 f9 f9 f9 f9 00 00 00 00   0x0000800ca080: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0000800ca090: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9   0x0000800ca0a0: 00 00 00 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0000800ca0b0: 00 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 =>0x0000800ca0c0: 00 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9[f9]00 00 00 00 00 00 00 f9   0x0000800ca0d0: f9 f9 f9 f9 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0000800ca0e0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0000800ca0f0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0000800ca100: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0000800ca110: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):   Addressable:           00   Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07    Heap left redzone:       fa   Freed heap region:       fd   Stack left redzone:      f1   Stack mid redzone:       f2   Stack right redzone:     f3   Stack after return:      f5   Stack use after scope:   f8   Global redzone:          f9   Global init order:       f6   Poisoned by user:        f7   Container overflow:      fc   Array cookie:            ac   Intra object redzone:    bb   ASan internal:           fe   Left alloca redzone:     ca   Right alloca redzone:    cb   Shadow gap:              cc ==106141==ABORTING  ``` |

| Ugh. Yet another issue caused by over-eager optimizing compilers... This compiler bug is only present in GCC and not in Clang. I've added an explicit overflow check so we shouldn't be triggering the "signed overflow -- now I can do anything!" compiler wankery. |

## Description

Buffer-overflow in jsdtoa.c in Artifex MuJS in versions 1.0.1 to 1.1.1. An integer overflow happens when js\_strtod() reads in floating point exponent, which leads to a buffer overflow in the pointer \*d.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Issue [#148](https://github.com/ccxvii/mujs/issues/148): Check for overflow when reading floating point exponent.

```
GCC with -O2 optimizes away the if(exp<-maxExponent) branch completely,
so we don't end up with the expected '512' value for overflowing
exponents. Limit the exponent parsing to MAX_INT instead to prevent
signed overflow from tripping up over-eager optimizing compilers.
