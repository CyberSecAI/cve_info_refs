Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-33013:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of CVE-2021-33013 is an improper access control mechanism within the mySCADA myPRO software, specifically, the software does not restrict unauthorized read access to sensitive system information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The software fails to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive system information.
*   **Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434)**: Allows unauthenticated remote attacker to upload arbitrary files. (Related to CVE-2021-33009)
*  **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (CWE-22)**: Allows unauthenticated remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to arbitrary directories. (Related to CVE-2021-33005)
*   **Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing (CWE-548):** The software doesn't prevent unauthorized access to directory listings containing sensitive information (Related to CVE-2021-27505)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the Improper Access Control vulnerability (CVE-2021-33013) could lead to unauthorized users gaining access to sensitive system information. Other vulnerabilities also allow for arbitrary file uploads, potentially leading to further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, meaning the vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker can be unauthenticated and does not require any special privileges to exploit the vulnerabilities. They must be able to reach the affected device over a network.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerabilities are present in myPRO versions prior to 8.20.0.
*   The advisory from CISA notes the software is deployed in critical infrastructure sectors worldwide.
*   The vendor, mySCADA, has released version 8.20.0 to address these issues.
*   CISA recommends minimizing network exposure of control system devices and isolating them behind firewalls.
*   The advisory also provides CVSS v3 base score of 8.2 for CVE-2021-33013. The CVSS vector string is AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N.
*   Other associated vulnerabilities have CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 and allow arbitrary file uploads and path traversal.
