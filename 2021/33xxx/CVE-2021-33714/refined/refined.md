- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A missing check for the validity of an iterator leads to a NULL pointer dereference.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack will cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition, crashing the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when parsing specially crafted JT files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a crafted JT file. User interaction is required to open the malicious file. The attack can be performed locally.
