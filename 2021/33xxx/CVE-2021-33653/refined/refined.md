{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A division by zero exception occurs when performing the derivation shape operation of the SpaceToBatch operator if there is a value of 0 in the parameter block_shape element.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Division by zero",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Crash or denial of service due to the division by zero exception.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specific input to the SpaceToBatch operator where the block_shape parameter contains a zero value. This is an input validation issue.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input parameters of the SpaceToBatch operator, specifically the block_shape parameter, to include a zero value."
