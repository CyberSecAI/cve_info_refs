- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The system does not properly check if a relative path is still within the intended target directory when deleting files or directories.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal (CWE-22), Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files or directories on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks. The attacker sends a crafted request to the web server of the affected application, including a user-controlled path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with high privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
