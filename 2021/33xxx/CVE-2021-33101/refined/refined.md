- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled search path in the Intel(R) GPA software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software does not properly control the search path, allowing an attacker to potentially inject malicious executables in the path that will be loaded instead of legitimate ones.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Escalation of privilege. An authenticated local user could potentially execute code with higher privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access, exploiting uncontrolled search path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated local user with the ability to modify or control the search path used by the Intel GPA software. The user also needs to interact with the software in a way that triggers the vulnerable code path, making user interaction a requirement for exploitation.
