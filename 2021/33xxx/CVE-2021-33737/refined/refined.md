- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Sending a specially crafted packet to port 102/tcp of an affected device can cause a denial of service condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119). This suggests a buffer overflow or similar memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The device becomes un-operational until it is restarted, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted packet to the device's port 102/tcp over a network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected device's port 102/tcp.
