Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2021-33687:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The SAP Portal servlet `com.sapportals.navigation.testComponent.NavigationRequestSniffer` exposes HTTP request headers within the HTML body of the response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure (CWE-200):** Sensitive information contained in HTTP request headers, such as session cookies, are disclosed in the HTML body of the response. This violates cookie security principles, as the data is treated as normal body data instead of being handled securely.
- Exposed cookies include `saplb_*`, `JSESSIONID`, `SAPWP_active`, `PortalAlias`, `MYSAPSSO2`, and `JSESSIONMARKID`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with administrator privileges, potentially in combination with other attacks (e.g., XSS), could exploit the exposed session cookies. This could lead to session hijacking and unauthorized access to the SAP Enterprise Portal, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions with the privileges of the compromised user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a specific HTTP endpoint (`com.sapportals.navigation.testComponent.NavigationRequestSniffer`).
- An attacker needs to send a request to this endpoint to observe the exposed header information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrator privileges:** The advisory states that the attacker needs administrator privileges to leverage the exposed data (likely in conjunction with other attacks such as XSS).
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
