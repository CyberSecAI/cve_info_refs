Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-33217

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Ruckus IoT Controller web application includes a NodeJS module called `node-red`. This module has built-in functionality that allows users to read and write to files on the local filesystem. Due to the web application running with root privileges, this functionality can be leveraged to read or write to *any* file on the controller's filesystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read/Write:** The `node-red` module provides the ability to read and write to arbitrary files on the filesystem.
*   **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges:** The web application, and consequently the `node-red` module, runs with root privileges. This elevates the impact of the file read/write vulnerability.
*   **Authentication Token Required, but Easily Obtained:** Although an authentication token is required to exploit the vulnerability, it is easily obtained due to hardcoded default credentials (related to CVE-2021-33219).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers can read and write to any file on the Ruckus IoT Controller filesystem.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating system files, an attacker can escalate privileges to root. This was demonstrated by adding a new user, modifying the shadow file, modifying the ssh configuration file, and adding the new user to the sudoers file.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The successful exploitation results in complete compromise of the Ruckus IoT Controller.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access to Web Application:** The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP requests to the web application interface.
*   **Abuse of node-red Functionality:** The vulnerability leverages the built-in file read/write capability of the `node-red` module.
* **POST Request:** The specific attack vector involves sending POST requests with crafted JSON payloads to the `/node-red/flows` endpoint to read and write arbitrary files via the `node-red` module

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Ruckus IoT Controller's web application.
*   **Authentication Token:** The attacker needs a valid authentication token for the web application, which is easily obtained via hardcoded credentials.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was used to add a new user to the `/etc/passwd` file, add a password hash to `/etc/shadow`, modify the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, and add the new user to `/etc/sudoers`, resulting in root-level access.
*   The provided proof of concept shows how the `node-red` file access functionality can be used to manipulate the file system and escalate privileges.
*   The vulnerability exists in Ruckus IoT Controller versions 1.7.1.0 and earlier.
*   The vendor released an updated firmware version 1.8.0.0 to remediate the issue.
