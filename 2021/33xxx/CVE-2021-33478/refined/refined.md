  "technical_details": "The vulnerability lies in the TrustZone implementation of Broadcom MediaxChange firmware. To exploit, an attacker must physically access the device, dismount the backplate, and send a series of impulses to the chipset, which reloads the device into a special mode. This mode grants access to the bootshell. By issuing specific commands with crafted parameters, the attacker can trigger the vulnerability.",
    "remediation": "Software updates have been released by Cisco to address the vulnerability. Customers are advised to refer to the Cisco bug IDs for each affected product for fixed software release information."
