SUMMARY

The latest update for SINEC NMS ﬁxes multiple vulnerabilities. The most severe could allow an authen-
ticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, with system privileges, under certain
conditions.

Siemens has released an update for SINEC NMS and recommends to update to the latest version.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

view/109802731/

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to port 443/tcp, to trusted IP addresses only

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINEC NMS is a new generation of the Network Management System (NMS) for the Digital Enterprise.
This system can be used to centrally monitor, manage, and conﬁgure networks.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-33722

The affected system has a Path Traversal vulnerability when exporting a ﬁrmware container. With this
a privileged authenticated attacker could create arbitrary ﬁles on an affected system.
