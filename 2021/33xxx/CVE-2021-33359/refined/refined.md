Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of restrictions on the URIs that could be submitted to the screenshot or report server. This allowed for the possibility of submitting `file://` URIs, which could lead to local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities. The software was not limiting the URIs it would process, allowing an attacker to read local files on the host system using the `file://` URI scheme.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary weakness is the ability to include and potentially read local files from the server's filesystem using the `file://` URI scheme when rendering screenshots or reports.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Potential:** Although not fully detailed, the content mentions that other problematic URIs, such as `localhost` and cloud metadata URIs, could also be reached and exploited if the report or screenshot servers are exposed to the internet. This implies a vulnerability to SSRF attacks as well.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive files from the host filesystem, such as configuration files, private keys, or other confidential data.
- **SSRF Attacks:** If the servers are exposed, attackers could use the server to make requests to internal resources, possibly leading to further information disclosure or other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Submitting malicious URIs:** The primary attack vector is submitting a crafted URI to the screenshot or report server that utilizes the `file://` scheme (or other restricted protocols) to include local files or access internal resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to submit URIs to the gowitness screenshot or report server, meaning either having direct access to the server or being able to influence a user to provide the malicous URI.
- For LFI, the attacker must be able to submit a URI to the target application.
- For SSRF, the attacker needs network access to the exposed report or screenshot server.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.3.6 by:
- Limiting the allowed URIs to those starting with `http://` or `https://` by default.
- Introducing a new `--allow-insecure-uri` or `-A` flag that can be used to disable this restriction (with a warning that this could be dangerous).
- By default the report and screenshot servers listen on localhost only.
