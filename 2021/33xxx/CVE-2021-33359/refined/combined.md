This is primarily a security/hardening release.

# fixes

* Limit the allowed URI's that may be submitted to the screenshot or report server to only those starting with `http` / `https` by default. You can use the new `--allow-insecure-uri` / `-A` flag to disable this. Take note that with the `-A` flag, it means someone could screenshot `file://` URI's and read local files on the host filesystem. To combat some of this abuse, by default the report & screenshot servers listen on localhost only. However, if you are exposing the report or screenshot servers to the Internet (or other untrusted networks), make sure you restrict access to it as other problematic URI's such as localhost and cloud metadata URIs (and any other SSRF vector) will also be reachable this way.
