Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33198:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `SetString` and `UnmarshalText` methods of `math/big.Rat` in the Go standard library are vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when these methods receive inputs with very large exponents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The methods can be made to panic or cause an unrecoverable fatal error, leading to a service disruption or crash.
*   **Unsafe Input Handling:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of very large exponents within the `math/big.Rat` methods.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit can cause a program using `math/big.Rat` to crash or become unavailable.
*   This impact could disrupt applications relying on the `math/big.Rat` functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by crafted input strings containing extremely large exponents.
*   An attacker would need to provide such input to the vulnerable `SetString` or `UnmarshalText` methods of `math/big.Rat` either directly or through other means such as web requests or file parsing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to supply the malicious input with large exponents to the vulnerable methods.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same system as the vulnerable code.
*  The attacker does not need any special privileges.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by the OSS-Fuzz project and reported by Emmanuel Odeke.
*  The vulnerability was fixed in Go versions 1.16.5 and 1.15.13.
*   The issue is also tracked as GitHub issue #45910.
