# Go: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **202208-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Go, the worst of which could result in remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/go** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.18.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.18.5** |

### Background

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Go. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Please review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Go users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/go-1.18.5"

```

In addition, users using Portage 3.0.9 or later should ensure that packages with Go binaries have no vulnerable code statically linked into their binaries by rebuilding the @golang-rebuild set:

```
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose @golang-rebuild

```

## Description

![@Cedric-Thomas](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29759183?u=484c965810f958ba05e2363d94078cefa775426f&v=4&size=48)[Cedric-Thomas](https://github.com/Cedric-Thomas)opened [on Mar 10, 2021](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/44910#issue-827532762)

Concerning the documentation <https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/chacha20poly1305#example-NewX>

the exemple is very good but it lack a bit of explanation for newcomer

i have this in my code:

```
/*
SELF-NOTE 🧐

The secret is not the nonce, it's the aead
generated from the NewX(key) with the key
so it's totally normal to add the nonce to
the ciphertext.
*/
```

because i'm kinda dumb and i don't directly understood the part:

```
// Encrypt the message and append the ciphertext to the nonce.
encryptedMsg = aead.Seal(nonce, nonce, msg, nil)
```

and

```
// Split nonce and ciphertext.
nonce, ciphertext := encryptedMsg[:aead.NonceSize()], encryptedMsg[aead.NonceSize():]
```

When I saw this, I was thinking that the nonce was the secret and don't understand why we add it to the ciphertext.

Maybe it's just me, but I think it can be useful to add a note somewhere in the documentation to avoid misunderstanding of the cipher and its implementation.

We have just released Go versions 1.16.5 and 1.15.13, minor point releases.

These minor releases include security fixes according to the new security policy ([#44918](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/44918)).

The SetString and UnmarshalText methods of [math/big.Rat](https://pkg.go.dev/math/big#Rat) may cause a panic or an unrecoverable fatal error if passed inputs with very large exponents.
This is issue [#45910](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/44910) and CVE-2021-33198.

Thanks to the OSS-Fuzz project for discovering this issue and to Emmanuel Odeke for reporting it.

ReverseProxy in [net/http/httputil](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/httputil) could be made to forward certain hop-by-hop headers, including Connection. In case the target of the ReverseProxy was itself a reverse proxy, this would let an attacker drop arbitrary headers, including those set by the ReverseProxy.Director.
This is issue [#46313](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/46313) and CVE-2021-33197.

Thanks to Mattias Grenfeldt ([https://grenfeldt.dev](https://grenfeldt.dev/)) and Asta Olofsson for reporting this issue.

The LookupCNAME, LookupSRV, LookupMX, LookupNS, and LookupAddr functions in [net](https://pkg.go.dev/net), and their respective methods on the [Resolver](https://pkg.go.dev/net#Resolver) type may return arbitrary values retrieved from DNS which do not follow the established [RFC 1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035)rules for domain names. If these names are used without further sanitization, for instance unsafely included in HTML, they may allow for injection of unexpected content. Note that LookupTXT may still return arbitrary values that could require sanitization before further use.
This is issue [#46241](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/46241) and CVE-2021-33195.

Thanks to Philipp Jeitner and Haya Shulman from Fraunhofer SIT for reporting this issue.

The NewReader and OpenReader functions in [archive/zip](https://pkg.go.dev/archive/zip) can cause a panic or an unrecoverable fatal error when reading an archive that claims to contain a large number of files, regardless of its actual size.
This is issue[#46242](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/46242)and CVE-2021-33196.

Thanks to the OSS-Fuzz project for discovering this issue and to Emmanuel Odeke for reporting it.

View the release notes for more information:
    <https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.16.minor>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go web site:
    <https://golang.org/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with
"git checkout go1.16.5" and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,
David and Carlos for the Go team
