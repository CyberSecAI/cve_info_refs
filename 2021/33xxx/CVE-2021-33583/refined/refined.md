- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The timeCard software contains a hardcoded password for the SQL server within the `TCServer.jar` file, specifically in the `com.reinersct.server.dao.db.InstRepGen.PASSWORD()` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hardcoded credentials. The SQL server's port is exposed, allowing remote connections.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to remotely connect to the SQL server as the `sa` user, and execute shell commands.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access to the exposed SQL server port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the SQL server's port, and the ability to use the hardcoded credentials.
