Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-33501:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a combination of a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue and a Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) sandbox escape within the Overwolf Client application.
*   The "overwolfstore://" URL handler is vulnerable to XSS due to insufficient sanitization of the `CATEGORY` parameter in URLs with the structure `overwolfstore://app/apps/<CATEGORY>/<EXTRAS>`.
*   The Overwolf application uses CEF and it allows the execution of arbitrary code by calling functions from the "overwolf-extension://" scheme.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The application reflects user-controlled input (the `CATEGORY` parameter) in the HTML response without proper sanitization.
*   **CEF Sandbox Escape:** The Overwolf JavaScript API exposes methods like `overwolf.utils.openUrlInDefaultBrowser` and `overwolf.io.writeFileContents`, which can be abused to execute arbitrary commands and write files to disk.
*   **Insecure URL Handling:** The application does not properly validate the values provided in the custom URL scheme, allowing for injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve RCE on the victim's machine by combining the XSS vulnerability with the CEF sandbox escape. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the operating system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to write arbitrary files allows the attacker to execute code with the same privileges as the Overwolf application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Custom URL Scheme Abuse:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL using the "overwolfstore://" custom scheme and tricks a user into opening it (e.g. through a malicious link).
*   **Web Browser:** The malicious link is likely delivered through a web browser as the custom scheme handler is commonly invoked by web browsers.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker can use social engineering techniques to lure a user into clicking the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Attacker:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing prior authentication.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice the user into opening a malicious link with the crafted "overwolfstore://" URL scheme.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker requires basic understanding of web-based attacks, specifically cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   **Overwolf knowledge:** The attacker needs to know about the existence of the custom scheme and the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `overwolfstore://` URL handler invokes the `Overwolf Appstore.exe` process.
*   The Javascript file `overwolf-extension://ojgnfnbjckbpfaciphphehonokbggjhpnnoafack/scripts/controllers/window.js` is in charge of parsing the URL.
*   The vulnerable code is located within the function `_this.decodeUrlSchemeParams` that extracts multiple parameters from the URL, and particularly, the `CATEGORY` parameter is not sanitized.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the `SECTION` portion of the URL is equal to `"apps"`.
*   The Overwolf Client generates a request to the backend with the value provided in `CATEGORY`.
*   The error message of the backend API response is embedded into the DOM of the Overwolf Store UI, which is a CEF browser.
*   The Overwolf JavaScript API methods `overwolf.utils.openUrlInDefaultBrowser` and `overwolf.io.writeFileContents` are used for the sandbox escape and command execution.
*   The exploit uses the `writeFileContents` method to write a batch file with the desired commands, then uses `openUrlInDefaultBrowser` to execute it.
*   The PoC URL contains double URL encoding in order to bypass restrictions of the CEF Browser.
