Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from incorrect default permissions within the Intel® RXT for Chromebook application.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the misconfiguration of default permissions, which allows for unauthorized access.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can potentially achieve information disclosure.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local access, implying that the attacker needs to have some level of access to the affected system.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the local system. The attacker must have high privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Summary of the Security Advisory:**

Intel identified a medium severity information disclosure vulnerability in the Intel® RXT for Chromebook application. The vulnerability arises due to incorrect default permissions, potentially allowing an authenticated local user to disclose information. Intel has discontinued the application and advises users to uninstall it. The provided CVSS vector is `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N`, which further reinforces the local, high privilege requirements for this vulnerability to be exploited.
