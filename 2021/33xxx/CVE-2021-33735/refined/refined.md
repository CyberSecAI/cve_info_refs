- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input when interacting with the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands in the local database, potentially leading to data manipulation, unauthorized access, or complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks, sending crafted requests to the webserver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with privileged access to the application.
