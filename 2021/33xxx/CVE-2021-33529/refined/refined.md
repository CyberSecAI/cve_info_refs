- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys within the service agent binary of Weidmueller Industrial WLAN devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hard-coded credentials (specifically, hard-coded cryptographic keys).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can decrypt captured network traffic from or to the device.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable by capturing network traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned to capture network traffic to/from the affected device. No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
