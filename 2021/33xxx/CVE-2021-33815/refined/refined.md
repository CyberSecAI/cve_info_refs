Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33815:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `avcodec/exr.c` file of FFmpeg, specifically in the `dwa_uncompress` function.
- The root cause is an insufficient check on the `dc_count` variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds access:** The original code had a check `if (dc_count > (6LL * td->xsize * td->ysize + 63) / 64)`, which was too lenient and did not correctly validate `dc_count` against the dimensions `dc_w` and `dc_h`.
- The `dc_count` value was being used to calculate the size of memory allocated using `av_fast_padded_malloc(&td->dc_data, &td->dc_size, FFALIGN(dest_len, 64) * 2)` where `dest_len` is `dc_count * 2LL`. When `dc_count` is too large compared to the actual size of data, it could result in an out of bounds write when data is later written to the allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The commit message indicates the vulnerability leads to an "out of array access".
- The Gentoo security advisory states that multiple vulnerabilities in FFmpeg, including this one, could lead to code execution, which suggests this specific vulnerability can have a more serious impact than just a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted EXR file.
- The attacker would need to control the input file provided to FFmpeg containing the crafted EXR image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious EXR file to a vulnerable version of FFmpeg. This could happen either through a local file or through a remote vector by providing the file to an application using FFmpeg.
- The attacker needs to craft the `dc_count` value in the EXR file to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided commit fixes the insufficient check with `if (dc_count != dc_w * dc_h * 3)`.
- Gentoo security advisory GLSA 202312-14 lists CVE-2021-33815 as one of multiple vulnerabilities present in affected versions of FFmpeg ( < 6.0 and < 4.4.3)
