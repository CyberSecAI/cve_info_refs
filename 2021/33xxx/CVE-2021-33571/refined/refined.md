  "CVE-2021-33571": {
    "description": "In Django 2.2 before 2.2.24, 3.x before 3.1.12, and 3.2 before 3.2.4, URLValidator, validate_ipv4_address, and validate_ipv46_address do not prohibit leading zero characters in octal literals. This may allow a bypass of access control that is based on IP addresses. (validate_ipv4_address and validate_ipv46_address are unaffected with Python 3.9.5+.)",
    "root_cause": "The `URLValidator`, `validate_ipv4_address`, and `validate_ipv46_address` functions in Django did not correctly sanitize IPv4 addresses and allowed leading zeros, which can be interpreted as octal literals. This could be used to bypass access controls relying on IP address validations.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "Possible indeterminate SSRF, RFI, and LFI attacks. Attackers could potentially bypass access controls or gain access to restricted resources by using IP addresses with leading zeros.  The vulnerability may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, addition, or modification of data.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted requests to a server utilizing Django's validators, where the IP address validation logic is used. The vector is network-based.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide the input for the IP address validation, such as through a web form or API call, but does not require any special permissions.  The attacker must have network access to the application using the vulnerable Django component."
