The provided content describes a command execution vulnerability.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is located in the `/wms/src/system/databak.php` file. The `filename` parameter, received through `$_POST`, is not sanitized before being passed to the `exec` function, resulting in command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability due to lack of input validation on the `filename` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server. As demonstrated, the attacker can add new system users.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a POST request with a malicious filename parameter to `/wms/src/system/databak.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable script.
