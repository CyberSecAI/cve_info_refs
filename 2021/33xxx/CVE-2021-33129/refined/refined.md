Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** Incorrect default permissions in the software installer for Intel Advisor.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The installer, prior to version 2021.4.0, sets insecure default permissions. This allows a local user to potentially exploit this flaw and escalate their privileges.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to local privilege escalation, meaning a regular user could gain administrative or higher-level access to the system.
* **Attack Vectors:** Local access is required for exploitation. The attack would be launched by a user who is already authenticated on the system.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the system. The attacker also needs some degree of knowledge/skill to manipulate the incorrectly set permissions to escalate privileges. The vulnerability has a high attack complexity

The content also provides a CVSS vector:
`CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`
which translates to:
- Attack Vector: Local
- Attack Complexity: High
- Privileges Required: Low
- User Interaction: Required
- Scope: Unchanged
- Confidentiality Impact: High
- Integrity Impact: High
- Availability Impact: High

The advisory states the vulnerability was reported by houjingyi.

The fix is to upgrade to Intel Advisor version 2021.4.0 or later.
