- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of the filename parameter in the upgrade.xml file, which allows special characters to bypass the code signing check.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper input validation, specifically in the handling of special characters within the filename parameter during the upgrade process.
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution.
- Attack vectors: A crafted upgrade.xml file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Remote attacker capability to provide a malicious upgrade.xml file.
