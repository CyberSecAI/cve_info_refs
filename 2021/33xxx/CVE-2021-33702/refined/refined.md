Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-33702:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `com.sap.tc~ep~nav~reporter.NavigationReporter` servlet in SAP Enterprise Portal does not properly sanitize the input URL stored during portal navigation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper input sanitization of the URL, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser session.
- The impact depends on the victim's privileges, but in the worst case, it can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data exfiltration
    - Data manipulation
    - Portal shutdown
- This can potentially compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the SAP portal and the data it handles.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must craft a malicious link containing JavaScript code.
- The victim needs to be tricked into clicking on the malicious link, causing the injected script to be stored within the portal's navigation history.
- Then the victim must navigate to the vulnerable servlet, which will execute the stored JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft and distribute malicious links, which can be achieved via phishing, social engineering or through another vulnerability.
- No specific privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability initially; however, higher privileges on the victim’s side will increase the impact of the exploit.
- The attacker doesn’t need to be authenticated. User interaction is required for successful exploitation.
