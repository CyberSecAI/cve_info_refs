Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-33118:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper access control in the software installer for the Intel Serial IO driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the software installer's access control mechanisms. This allows an attacker to bypass intended restrictions on access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Escalation of Privilege:** An attacker can potentially escalate their privileges on the system. This means they could gain higher-level access, potentially allowing them to perform actions they would normally not be authorized to do.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to the target system.
*   **Authenticated User:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local, authenticated user on the affected system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable Intel Serial IO driver installer.
*   The attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability before it is patched.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects Intel Serial IO drivers for Intel NUC 11 Gen, specifically versions prior to 30.100.2104.1.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability can be mitigated by updating to Intel Serial IO driver version 30.100.2104.1 or later.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS Base Score of 6.7 (Medium).
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
    *   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The attacker must have local access to the system.
    *   **AC:H (Attack Complexity: High):**  Exploitation requires specialized conditions to be present.
    *   **PR:L (Privileges Required: Low):** The attacker needs only low-level user access.
    *    **UI:R (User Interaction: Required):** The attack requires user interaction.
    *   **S:U (Scope: Unchanged):** An exploited vulnerability only affects the vulnerable component.
    *   **C:H (Confidentiality Impact: High):** There is a high impact on confidentiality of data.
    *   **I:H (Integrity Impact: High):** There is a high impact on data integrity.
     *   **A:H (Availability Impact: High):** There is a high impact on the availability of the attacked system.
