- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected TOYOPUC products are vulnerable to an ICMP flood which they may not be able to process correctly.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to deny Ethernet communications between affected devices.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can send an ICMP flood to the affected devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to reach the target network where the vulnerable devices are located. Low attack complexity is noted.
