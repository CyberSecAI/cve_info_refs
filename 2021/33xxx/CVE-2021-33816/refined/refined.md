Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The Dolibarr ERP & CRM application, specifically within its website builder module, fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of shell commands through backticks (``). Although the application attempts to block common functions like `exec()`, `system()`, and `shell_exec()`, it overlooks the equivalent functionality of backticks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary PHP code, specifically using backticks for shell command execution, into website page content.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application lacks proper input sanitization when processing user-supplied content for website pages.
*   **Bypass of Filtering:** The application's attempt to block specific dangerous functions is circumvented by the use of backticks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Dolibarr application.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the server, potentially granting access to sensitive data, the ability to install malware, and the ability to disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/website/index.php` endpoint, specifically with the `updatesource` action.
*   **Website Builder Module:** The vulnerability is located within the website builder module of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid account with sufficient privileges to access and modify the website builder module.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Dolibarr application server.
