Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Apache APISIX Dashboard version 2.6 changed the default listen host to 0.0.0.0 to allow external network access.
*   A risky function was used for IP acquisition in the IP allowed list restriction, leading to a bypass of the network limits.
*   The default account and password were fixed and not changed after installation, contributing to the security risk.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Network Access Control Bypass:** The vulnerability stems from a flawed implementation of IP address filtering, allowing unauthorized access despite configured network restrictions.
*   **Use of Default Credentials:** The usage of fixed default account and password makes it easier for attackers to gain initial access if the credentials were not changed after installation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can bypass the network access control restrictions, which may allow them to gain unauthorized access to the APISIX dashboard.
*   An attacker can potentially gain full access to the APISIX dashboard by using the default credentials if they were not changed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Remote exploitation via network access to the Apache APISIX Dashboard.
*   Leveraging a flawed IP acquisition mechanism.
*   Utilizing default credentials for unauthorized access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the Apache APISIX Dashboard.
*   The attacker needs to be able to exploit the vulnerability in the IP address filtering mechanism.
*   The attacker can use default credentials if they were not changed.
*   The attacker doesn't need any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in Apache APISIX Dashboard version 2.6.1.
*   The recommendation is to change the default account password and upgrade to version 2.6.1 or later.
