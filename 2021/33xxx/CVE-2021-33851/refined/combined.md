## CVE-2021-33851 – Stored Cross-Site Scripting in WordPress Customize Login Image

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/medium.png)

Severity:Medium

#### Vendor

##### WordPress

#### Affected Product

##### Customize Login Image

#### CVE

##### CVE-2021-33851

#### Securin ID

##### 2021-CSW-11-1052

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### December 2, 2021

### Description

A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack can cause arbitrary code (JavaScript) to run in a userâs browser while the browser is connected to a trusted website. The attack targets your application’s users and not the application itself while using your application as the attack’s vehicle. The XSS payload executes whenever the user opens the login page of the WordPress application.

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

The following vulnerability was discovered in Customize Login Image version 3.4.

Issue: Stored Cross-Site Scripting

1. Login to the WordPress application.

**Note:** A virtual host (wptest.com) is used for testing the application locally.

2. Install the Customize Login Image Plugin.
3. Go to the âSettingsâ menu and click on the âCustomize Login Imageâ drop list.

4. Enter the payload – <script>alert(document.cookie)</script> in the âCustom Logo Linkâ field (cli\_logo\_url parameter).

***Figure 02: Entering encodedÂ  XSS payload in theÂ  âCustom Logo Linkâ field***

5. Click on the âSave Changesâ button
6. Go to the WordPress login page at /wp-login.php .

***Figure 03: Injected XSS payload is executed and displays an alert box containing the userâs cookies.***

### Impact

An attacker can perform the following:

* Inject malicious code into the vulnerable variable and exploit the application through the Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.
* Modify the code and get the session information of other users.
* Compromise the user machine.

### Remediations

* Perform context-sensitive encoding of entrusted input before echoing back to a browser using an encoding library throughout the application.
* Implement input validation for special characters on all the variables are reflected in the browser and stored in the database.
* Explicitly set the character set encoding for each page generated by the webserver.
* Encode dynamic output elements and filter specific characters in dynamic elements.
