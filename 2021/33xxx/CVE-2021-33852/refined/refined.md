The content is related to CVE-2021-33852.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding within the Post Duplicator Plugin for WordPress. Specifically, user-supplied input in the "Duplicate Title" and "Duplicate Slug" fields are not sanitized before being stored and later rendered in the application's pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings.
- This malicious code can execute in a user's browser when they access the plugin settings page or when they view a duplicated post.
- The attacker can potentially steal session cookies, modify the content of the page, or redirect the user to a malicious site.
- The injected scripts can compromise the user's machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious actor needs to gain access to the WordPress admin panel.
- The attacker navigates to the Post Duplicator plugin settings page.
- They inject malicious Javascript code into the `mtphr_post_duplicator_settings[title]` (Duplicate Title) and `mtphr_post_duplicator_settings[slug]` (Duplicate Slug) parameters.
- The malicious script will then execute when the plugin's settings page is accessed, or when a duplicated post is viewed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative access to the WordPress instance to be able to install, configure, and use the vulnerable plugin.
