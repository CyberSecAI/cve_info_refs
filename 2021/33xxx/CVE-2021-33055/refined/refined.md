Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-33055:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of user-supplied credentials when a password change is performed using a PowerShell script. Specifically, special characters (Unicode quotes) in the new password are not handled correctly when they are inserted into the PowerShell script, allowing for injection of malicious commands.
*   The vulnerability is system locale dependent, meaning it's only exploitable when ADSelfService Plus (ADSSP) is installed on specific versions of Windows (e.g., Japanese versions), due to different encodings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **PowerShell Injection:** Failure to properly sanitize user input before incorporating it into a PowerShell command creates a command injection vulnerability, which can lead to remote code execution.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the input in the `newPassword` parameter when a password change is requested, allowing an attacker to insert shell meta characters and arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server where ADSelfService Plus is installed. This can lead to a compromise of the server, allowing attackers to steal data, install malware, or pivot to other systems in the network.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can execute commands with the privileges of the ADSelfService Plus service, which could be SYSTEM or another high privilege account, depending on the setup.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack is performed remotely by sending a crafted HTTP request to the ADSelfService Plus server's API.
*   **API Endpoint:** The specific API endpoint `RestAPI/ChangePasswordAPI` is vulnerable when performing password changes.
*  **Specifically crafted newPassword parameter:** The `newPassword` parameter in the HTTP request carries a malicious payload that injects arbitrary code into the PowerShell script executed by the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the ADSelfService Plus server.
*   **Knowledge of the Target System:** The attacker needs to know or guess the ADSSP server URL, the domain name and can use any valid username.
*   **Special Character Encoding:** The attacker needs to know which special characters (e.g., Unicode quotation marks) cause the injection to occur on the specific target Windows version. The exploit code provided shows the use of `b"\xc2\x81h"` to achieve this on Japanese systems.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attack is possible without authentication; only a valid username (e.g. 'krbtgt' in the provided PoC) and domain name are needed.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Versions of ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus prior to 6105 are vulnerable.
*   **System Locale Dependency:** The exploit is specific to systems with certain locale settings, primarily Japanese Windows due to its encoding.
*   **PoC Exploit:**  A Python-based proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is available, which can be used to execute arbitrary commands on the target system, making it easy to test and verify the vulnerability.
*   **Patch Availability:** A patch has been released by ManageEngine to address this vulnerability.

**In summary, CVE-2021-33055 is a critical vulnerability that allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems running vulnerable versions of ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus if specific locale settings are in place. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization leading to PowerShell injection.**
