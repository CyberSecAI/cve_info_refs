**Blog posts**

[PowerShell script, Unicode quotes and ウィンドウズ - a story of uncommon command injection](https://blog.stmcyber.com/powershell-unicode-quotes-and-command-injection/)

**Description**

In some cases user password change is done using PowerShell script. User credentials inserted into such script are not properly sanitized, leading to PowerShell script injection and remote code execution. This vulnerability is exploitable only when ADSSP is installed on certain versions of Windows (system language/locale dependant).

1. Download [CVE-2021-33055.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STMCyber/CVEs/main/CVE-2021-33055/CVE-2021-33055.py) and modify the following values in the script:
   `URL` - ADSSP address (running on Japanese Windows)
   `DOMAIN` - Active Directory domain configured in ADSSP
   `CMD` - command to be executed on the ADSSP server
2. Execute CVE-2021-33055.py script (using Python 3 interpreter).
3. Command defined in `CMD` variable will be executed on ADSSP server.

**Timeline**

* 07-05-2021 - Vulnerability reported to vendor
* 07-05-2021 - First response from vendor
* 18-05-2021 - Patch for retest received from vendor

# STM CYBER CREATES EXPLOITS AND REDUCES THE MOST CRITICAL THREATS TO YOUR ORGANISATION

![5.png](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3143c3_48231221ec4f4b40b9235487ca05caa5~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_521,h_519,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/5.png)

​

Our experts rely on their unparalleled knowledge to battle the daily dangers you encounter. With our technical expertise and strategic vision, we are best equipped to assist businesses in identifying, assessing, and mitigating risk factors and responding to them quickly.

STM CYBER COOPERATES WITH COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS TO IDENTIFY THREATS TO INFORMATION SECURITY. LEARN HOW WE MAY ASSIST YOU IN OPTIMIZING YOUR CYBERSECURITY

## STM Cyber Statement regarding the Internal Control System

Validity of the Internal Control System

The effectiveness of the Internal Control System (ISC) is based on a written statement of the ICM Policy. This document, addressed to all employees, presents the company's official position on turnover control and the implementation and maintenance of WSK.

The Company's policy regarding international trade in goods, technologies, and services of strategic importance

Our company conducts foreign trade in goods of strategic importance by the law of the Republic of Poland, international regulations, and principles resulting from non-proliferation agreements in which Poland participates.

Aware of the role we play in ensuring national and international security by preventing uncontrolled trade in dual-use goods and weapons, we have implemented and maintained an Internal Control System in our company.

If it turns out that a given transaction is inconsistent with national law or the potential contractor raises reasonable suspicions of violating international rules on trade in goods, technologies, and services of strategic importance, the transaction will not be completed.

Our company excludes the possibility of making profits in a manner contrary to the trade control policy.

All employees, entities, and cooperating persons who are familiar with the requirements of the Internal Control System are obliged to comply with them and immediately inform the WSK Representative about any transactions, practices, or attempted actions that are inconsistent with applicable law.

If non-compliance with the requirements is detected, the company takes appropriate corrective, elimination, and preventive actions.

The involvement of all employees in maintaining the functionality of the Internal Control System increases trust in our company, making it more competitive and credible.

Employees are obliged to comply with the principles set out in this statement under penalty of professional liability.
