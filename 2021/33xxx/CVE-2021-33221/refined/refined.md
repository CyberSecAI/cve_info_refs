Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-33221

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The CommScope Ruckus IoT Controller has several API endpoints that lack proper authentication, allowing unauthenticated access to sensitive functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** Three API endpoints are accessible without any authentication.
- **Information Leakage:** Two of the vulnerable endpoints expose sensitive system and configuration information, potentially including DNS/NTP servers, internal hostname, IoT Controller version, and potentially API keys and tokens for fully configured devices.
- **Resource Consumption:** One endpoint allows generation of diagnostic files, which consumes CPU and disk resources.
- **Factory Reset:** One endpoint allows an unauthenticated user to trigger a factory reset of the IoT Controller, deleting the current device configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive system and configuration details, which could be used for further attacks.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could consume system resources by repeatedly triggering diagnostic file generation.
- **Service Disruption:** Attackers can remotely reset the device to factory defaults, removing the existing configuration, leading to operational disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Unauthenticated network access to the affected API endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable API endpoints via network access. No prior authentication is needed to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory provides example URLs for the vulnerable endpoints.
- The vendor released a fix in firmware version 1.8.0.0.
