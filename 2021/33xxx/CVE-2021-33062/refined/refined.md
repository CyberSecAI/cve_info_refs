Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect default permissions in the software installer for Intel VTune Profiler.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The installer sets insecure default permissions, potentially allowing unauthorized file access or modification. This can lead to privilege escalation.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated local user can potentially escalate their privileges. This could allow them to gain higher level access to the system, potentially compromising the system's integrity or confidentiality.
*   **Attack vectors:** Local access is required. An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must have a local account on the target machine. User interaction is required since the user must launch the installer, which is likely the trigger for the insecure permission setting. The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Intel VTune Profiler versions prior to 2021.3.0.
*   The CVSS score is 6.7, which is categorized as MEDIUM severity.
*   The CVSS vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, which breaks down to:
    *   AV:L (Attack Vector: Local)
    *   AC:H (Attack Complexity: High)
    *   PR:L (Privileges Required: Low)
    *   UI:R (User Interaction: Required)
    *   S:U (Scope: Unchanged)
    *   C:H (Confidentiality Impact: High)
    *   I:H (Integrity Impact: High)
    *   A:H (Availability Impact: High)
