  "CVE-2021-33037": {
    "Description": "The provided document is a summary of security vulnerabilities patched in Oracle products as part of the October 2021 Critical Patch Update. It specifically mentions CVE-2021-33037, indicating its relevance to the advisory. This CVE is also present in the NetApp document and Debian LTS advisory.",
    "Root cause": "Apache Tomcat did not correctly parse the HTTP transfer-encoding request header in some circumstances.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of HTTP transfer-encoding headers",
      "Incorrectly ignoring the transfer encoding header if the client declared it would only accept an HTTP/1.0 response",
      "Honoring the identify encoding",
      "Not ensuring that, if present, the chunked encoding was the final encoding."
    ],
    "Impact": "The primary impact is HTTP request smuggling. The successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS) depending on the context.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploitation of vulnerable HTTP transfer-encoding handling when used with a reverse proxy."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests with specific Transfer-Encoding headers to a system running a vulnerable version of Apache Tomcat."
  },

    "Description": "The provided document is a summary of security vulnerabilities patched in Oracle products as part of the October 2021 Critical Patch Update. It specifically mentions CVE-2021-33037, indicating its relevance to the advisory. This CVE is also present in the NetApp document and Debian LTS advisory.",
    "Root cause": "A vulnerability in the JNDI Realm of Apache Tomcat allows an attacker to authenticate using variations of a valid user name and/or to bypass some of the protection provided by the LockOut Realm.",
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Insecure JNDI Realm implementation",
        "Insufficient protection from brute-force user enumeration due to the lack of lockout enforcement."
    ],
    "Impact": "The primary impact is authentication bypass where an attacker may be able to authenticate using variations of a valid username or bypass logout restrictions. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS) depending on the context.",
      "Attack vectors": [
      "Malicious use of variations of a valid username for authentication, potentially via network access to systems running vulnerable versions of Apache Tomcat with JNDI Realm configured."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker requires the ability to make HTTP requests to a system with a vulnerable version of Apache Tomcat configured to use JNDI realm."
