SUMMARY

Siemens has released version V13.2.0.2 for JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization to ﬁx three vulnerabilities
that could be triggered while parsing DGN or PAR ﬁles. If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with
the affected products, this could lead the application to crash or potential arbitrary code execution.

Siemens recommends to update to the latest versions and to limit opening of untrusted ﬁles from unknown
sources in the affected products.

Note:

• This advisory also covers security vulnerabilities recently disclosed by Open Design Alliance [0]

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Teamcenter Visualization software enables enterprises to enhance their product lifecycle management
(PLM) environment with a comprehensive family of visualization solutions. The software enables enter-
prise users to access documents, 2D drawings and 3D models in a single environment.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-32946

An improper check for unusual or exceptional conditions issue exists within the parsing DGN ﬁles
from Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK (Version 2022.4 and prior) resulting from the lack of proper
validation of the user-supplied data. This may result in several of out-of-bounds problems and allow
attackers to cause a denial-of-service condition or execute code in the context of the current process.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-32952

An out-of-bounds write issue exists in the DGN ﬁle-reading procedure in the Drawings SDK (Version
2022.4 and prior) resulting from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This can result in a
write past the end of an allocated buffer and allow attackers to cause a denial-of-service condition or
execute code in the context of the current process.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-33738

The plmxmlAdapterSE70.dll library in affected applications lacks proper validation of user-supplied
data when parsing PAR ﬁles. This could result in an out of bounds read past the end of an allocated
buffer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to leak information in the context of the current
process. (ZDI-CAN-13405)

## Siemens JT2Go PAR File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-981ZDI-CAN-13405

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-33738](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-33738) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 3.3, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Siemens |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [JT2Go](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/plm-components/jt2go.html) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Siemens JT2Go. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PAR files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. |
