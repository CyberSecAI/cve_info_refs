Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `/controller/fetchpwd.php` file of the `Hotels_Server` application.
- The application directly incorporates the `username` parameter received from the user into an SQL query without any sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `username` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete data from the database. This could lead to:
  - Data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive user information.
  - Manipulation of application data, including user credentials, financial records, etc.
  - Denial-of-service by potentially crashing the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via the HTTP request to `/controller/fetchpwd.php`.
- The `username` parameter within the request's data is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `/controller/fetchpwd.php` endpoint with a crafted username parameter. This suggests the attacker can be unauthenticated, however, more information is needed to fully define the authorization requirements.
- Basic knowledge of SQL and SQL injection techniques is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue report includes the command `sqlmap -u "<http://192.168.31.91/controller/fetchpwd.php>" --data "username=1" --dbms mysql -p username` as a way to test for the SQL injection. This provides a clear method to reproduce the vulnerability and suggests the database is likely MySQL.
- Screenshots are provided showing `sqlmap` successfully detecting the SQL injection vulnerability.
