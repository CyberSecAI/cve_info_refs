Hi Jeremy,

I'm sorry about the delay.  I was hoping someone else would chime in.

There's no specific requirement on the number of examples.  The above
looks reasonable to me.

I cannot speak for them, but the task does require some effort on every
issue, and perhaps the specific people are just not putting the effort.
As you can see, this was different in 2017-2019 when Gentoo had a person
actually working on this task.

Besides statistics per se, an important desirable side-effect of working
on this task is that you'd end up double-checking that every issue does
in fact get reported to oss-security.

Like he says, he'd "be a lot more comfortable if someone could provide a
stronger vouch."

However, overall I think Pop!_OS and you personally (also considering
your work on Redox OS) do meet the requirements.  So let's proceed with
the subscription.  Please e-mail me off-list with your e-mail address
and PGP key to use.  Please also confirm in this thread that we're
getting the statistics task assigned to you, and we can discuss some
specifics on what's to be done on it.

Thanks,

Alexander

How many examples should I provide? The last security patch I did was for
systemd. We have patches on systemd which means we cannot use the Ubuntu
version directly, so when, for example, CVE-2020-13529 and CVE-2021-33910
patches arrived in Ubuntu 21.04 on July 20, 2021, I applied them to our own
fork of systemd for Pop!_OS 21.04 that same day:

- [https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/247.3-3ubuntu3.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/systemd/247.3-3ubuntu3.4)
- <https://github.com/pop-os/systemd/commit/bf008f836b8740f6634d02526d1f38c98fa6699a>

Pop!_OS needs to participate in linux-distros to ensure we have patches ready
for our forks of packages that do not come straight from Ubuntu. I listed the
relevant packages in my original email, many of which we have had to do
security updates for after some embargo lifts, with very little time to prepare.

That would be fine, but I would be curious if there is some reason they have
not been fulfilling this task.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-2a6ba64260
2021-07-22 01:13:10.976418
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : systemd
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 248.5
Release : 1.fc34
URL : <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd>
Summary : System and Service Manager
Description :
systemd is a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts
the rest of the system. It provides aggressive parallelization
capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services,
offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points, and
implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control
logic. systemd supports SysV and LSB init scripts and works as a
replacement for sysvinit. Other parts of this package are a logging daemon,
utilities to control basic system configuration like the hostname,
date, locale, maintain a list of logged-in users, system accounts,
runtime directories and settings, and daemons to manage simple network
configuration, network time synchronization, log forwarding, and name
resolution.

This package was built from the 248.5-stable branch of systemd.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

- Various minor documentation and correctness fixes. - CVE-2021-33910, #1984020:
an unchecked stack allocation could be used to crash systemd and cause the
system to reboot by creating a very long fuse mountpoint path. No need to log
out or reboot.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The path may have unbounded length, for example through a fuse mount.

[CVE-2021-33910](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5337-wcgc-wcvp "CVE-2021-33910"): attacked controlled alloca() leads to crash in systemd and
ultimately a kernel panic. Systemd parses the content of /proc/self/mountinfo
and each mountpoint is passed to mount_setup_unit(), which calls
unit_name_path_escape() underneath. A local attacker who is able to mount a
filesystem with a very long path can crash systemd and the whole system.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1970887>

The resulting string length is bounded by UNIT_NAME_MAX, which is 256. But we
can't easily check the length after simplification before doing the
simplification, which in turns uses a copy of the string we can write to.
So we can't reject paths that are too long before doing the duplication.
Hence the most obvious solution is to switch back to strdup(), as before

# [MEM05-C. Avoid large stack allocations](/confluence/display/c/MEM05-C.%2BAvoid%2Blarge%2Bstack%2Ballocations)

* Created by  [rlane](/confluence/display/~rlane), last modified by  [Jill Britton](/confluence/display/~jill_britton) on [Apr 20, 2023](/confluence/pages/diffpagesbyversion.action?pageId=87152078&selectedPageVersions=124&selectedPageVersions=125 "Show changes")

Avoid excessive stack allocations, particularly in situations where the growth of the stack can be controlled or influenced by an attacker. See [INT04-C. Enforce limits on integer values originating from tainted sources](/confluence/display/c/INT04-C.%2BEnforce%2Blimits%2Bon%2Binteger%2Bvalues%2Boriginating%2Bfrom%2Btainted%2Bsources) for more information on preventing attacker-controlled integers from exhausting memory.

## Noncompliant Code Example

The C Standard includes support for variable length arrays (VLAs). If the array length is derived from an [untrusted data](/confluence/display/c/BB.%2BDefinitions#BB.Definitions-untrusteddata) source, an attacker can cause the process to perform an excessive allocation on the stack.

This noncompliant code example temporarily stores data read from a source file into a buffer. The buffer is allocated on the stack as a VLA of size `bufsize`. If `bufsize` can be controlled by a malicious user, this code can be [exploited](/confluence/display/c/BB.%2BDefinitions#BB.Definitions-exploit) to cause a [denial-of-service attack](/confluence/display/c/BB.%2BDefinitions#BB.Definitions-denial-of-serviceattack):

```
int copy_file(FILE *src, FILE *dst, size_t bufsize) {
  char buf[bufsize];

  while (fgets(buf, bufsize, src)) {
    if (fputs(buf, dst) == EOF) {
      /* Handle error */
    }
  }

  return 0;
}

```

The BSD extension function `alloca()` behaves in a similar fashion to VLAs; its use is not recommended [[Loosemore 2007](/confluence/display/c/AA.%2BBibliography#AA.Bibliography-Loosemore07)].

## Compliant Solution

This compliant solution replaces the VLA with a call to `malloc()`. If `malloc()` fails, the return value can be checked to prevent the program from terminating abnormally.

```
int copy_file(FILE *src, FILE *dst, size_t bufsize) {
  if (bufsize == 0) {
    /* Handle error */
  }
  char *buf = (char *)malloc(bufsize);
  if (!buf) {
    /* Handle error */
  }

  while (fgets(buf, bufsize, src)) {
    if (fputs(buf, dst) == EOF) {
      /* Handle error */
    }
  }
  /* ... */
  free(buf);
  return 0;
}

```
## Noncompliant Code Example

Recursion can also lead to large stack allocations. Recursive functions must ensure that they do not exhaust the stack as a result of excessive recursions.

This noncompliant implementation of the Fibonacci function uses recursion:

```
unsigned long fib1(unsigned int n) {
  if (n == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  else if (n == 1 || n == 2) {
    return 1;
  }
  else {
    return fib1(n-1) + fib1(n-2);
  }
}

```

The amount of stack space needed grows linearly with respect to the parameter `n`. Large values of `n` have been shown to cause [abnormal program termination](/confluence/display/c/BB.%2BDefinitions#BB.Definitions-abnormaltermination).

## Compliant Solution

This implementation of the Fibonacci functions eliminates the use of recursion:

```
unsigned long fib2(unsigned int n) {
  if (n == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  else if (n == 1 || n == 2) {
    return 1;
  }

  unsigned long prev = 1;
  unsigned long cur = 1;

  unsigned int i;

  for (i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    unsigned long tmp = cur;
    cur = cur + prev;
    prev = tmp;
  }

  return cur;
}

```

Because there is no recursion, the amount of stack space needed does not depend on the parameter `n`, greatly reducing the risk of stack overflow.

## Risk Assessment

Program stacks are frequently used for convenient temporary storage because allocated memory is automatically freed when the function returns. Generally, the operating system grows the stack as needed. However, growing the stack can fail because of a lack of memory or a collision with other allocated areas of the address space (depending on the architecture). When the stack is exhausted, the operating system can terminate the program abnormally. This behavior can be exploited, and an attacker can cause a denial-of-service attack if he or she can control or influence the amount of stack memory allocated.

### Related Vulnerabilities

Stack overflow has been implicated in Toyota unintended acceleration cases, where Camry and other Toyota vehicles accelerated unexpectedly.  Michael Barr testified at the trial that a stack overflow could corrupt the critical variables of the operating system, because they were located in memory adjacent to the top of the stack [Samek 2014].

   Reading the comments, I'm not sure if this was once in here or not, but it should be pointed out that the same holds true for using alloca(), most implementations I've seen do no sanity checking whatsoever and simply decrement/increment the stack pointer by that much yielding a potentially bogus/dangerous stack pointer.

      I agree that `alloca()` warrants concern, but (as pointed out in the comments above) `alloca()` is not included because it is not a C99 function.

   Even a couple of BUFSIZed buffers can be too much to allocate as autos.  Some platforms require specification of a fixed stack at link time; this was true for Gould/Encore PowerNode and is also generally true for embedded systems.

   If we're going to use C99 in the non-recursive solution, shouldn't the loop start:

   ```
   for (unsigned int i = 3; i < n; i++)

   ```

   That scopes the variable i to the loop.

   Is there any portable way to know just how much space is available on the stack? How big a VLA can my function have? Could a CCE that uses VLAs even exist?

   For that matter could a CCE that employs recursion (where the user can control the level of recursion) exist?

      Good question, with no good answer. Typically 'too large' here means that something bad happens. Many systems have a fixed page of memory for the stack and the stack overruns that page, the program coredumps. But this is not enforced by the standard...C99 doesn't even define a 'stack', so you could have implementations which don't use a stack (don't ask me what they do instead ![(smile)](/confluence/s/-o9df8y/9012/oiycav/_/images/icons/emoticons/smile.svg)

      The closest usable statistic that C99 mandates is that your platform must support functions with up to 127 args (S5.2.4.2).

   #### [Jann Horn](/confluence/display/~thejh)

   I think it's important here that the combination of attacker-controlled recursion and large allocations can lead to arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities. For example, if you do threading with pthreads on linux, there is a 4096-byte guard page below the area reserved for the thread stack, and directly below that is memory that was e.g. allocated using malloc() or so. Accesses to the guard page cause an abnormal termination, but if an attacker can cause an application to first use up nearly all the available stack space, then allocate >=4096 unused bytes on the stack and then call another function, its saved instruction pointer is in a malloc()ed memory area or so where an unprivileged user in another thread might be able to overwrite it.

   Is that really low severity?

   Edit: But it seems that there are compiler options to mitigate that (-fstack-check for gcc).

      I've changed the severity to medium. Clearly, excessive stack allocations can corrupt non-stack memory, in light of the Toyota allegations (see the Related Vuls section for details). I'm less confident that an attacker can use large stack allocations to execute arbitrary code, though it should be theoretically possible.

      I also suspect that this should be a rule, or we should create a rule saying something like "don't let an attacker make arbitarry stack allocations, using VLAs or recusion". Such a rule would have high severity, as fine control of the stack size would be necessary for an attacker to run arbitrary code.

   The Fibonacci example will take exponential time, but will not consume exponential stack space, will only consume linear stack space.

   You can just try it, your application will not crash when n is small number like 500 or 1000,

   but will only crash when n reaches 100000 or so. I bet you don't have a stack as large as 2^1000 (or 1.618 ^ 1000) .

   In fact you can reason that, since the recursion depth is bounded by parameter n, you will not use more than linear space.

   #### [Stefan Tauner](/confluence/display/~stefanct)

   The first example suggests using malloc instead of allocating memory at the stack. Apart from being a relatively complex example (the whole loop and file access has nothing to do with the rule) the mitigation of simply relying on malloc's error handling is a bit disappointing. Allowing an external entity to control the amount of allocated memory is in itself a problem as it might lead to a DoS attack even when heap memory is used.

   Also, since the definition of "[too] large" is not possibly in a portable manner, wouldn't it make more sense to formulate the rule more similar to the tainted rules of ISO 17961 or [INT04-C](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=87148966)? I.e. "validate values that specify the amount of memory to allocate". I suppose one could even argue that [INT04-C](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=87148966) could replace this very rule - not because they are equal but due to the lack of a good definition of "[too] large". Not even the implementing compiler or static analyzers can determine what "[too] large" is in many cases... so this rule is simply a warning sign with no actionable consequences for programmers or tool writers. I presume the standard committees have put way more thought into the issue (of not even introducing stack in their wording) than me... a reference to documentation on these discussions might be useful if it exists.

   The "[[van Sprundel 2006](http://ilja.netric.org/files/Unusual%20bugs.pdf)]" reference is dead. Maybe referring to the video instead is viable? <https://media.ccc.de/v/23C3-1456-en-unusual_bugs>

      #### [David Svoboda](/confluence/display/~svoboda)

      Stefan, thanks for your suggestions.

      I changed the 1st compliant solution to not return -1 if malloc() fails, mainly for consistency with the rest of the code.

      I added a reference to INT04-C as you suggest. INT04-C does not subsume this rec as it does not address memory exhaustion; both are worthwhile recommendations.

      You are correct that the C11 standard offers very little help wrt stack exhaustion. It does (barely) acknowledge that every platform actually \*has\* a stack, which can be exhausted, but if exhausted the result is Undefined Behavior. So you are on your own for preventing or detecting stack exhaustion.

      I agree that not having any check that the allocation is too large can be problematic, but there is no clear solution how to rectify that. At least malloc() will return null, which is more than you'd get if you used something like alloca() :)

      Finally, I killed the "van Sprundel" link. I decided not to add the video because, while interesting, it was not an original source used to build this rule. I'm also uncertain if your video is the some one that the dead link referenced.

The path may have unbounded length, for example through a fuse mount.

[CVE-2021-33910](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5337-wcgc-wcvp "CVE-2021-33910"): attacked controlled alloca() leads to crash in systemd and
ultimately a kernel panic. Systemd parses the content of /proc/self/mountinfo
and each mountpoint is passed to mount_setup_unit(), which calls
unit_name_path_escape() underneath. A local attacker who is able to mount a
filesystem with a very long path can crash systemd and the whole system.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1970887>

The resulting string length is bounded by UNIT_NAME_MAX, which is 256. But we
can't easily check the length after simplification before doing the
simplification, which in turns uses a copy of the string we can write to.
So we can't reject paths that are too long before doing the duplication.
Hence the most obvious solution is to switch back to strdup(), as before

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE LPE9000 (Local Processing Engine) extends the SCALANCE family portfolio by a component
that provides computing power for a wide range of applications in the network, close to the process –
Edge Computing.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-27304

The CivetWeb web library does not validate uploaded ﬁlepaths when running on an OS other

Vulnerability CVE-2021-41089

A vulnerability was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where attempting to copy ﬁles using docker cp
into a specially-crafted container can result in Unix ﬁle permission changes for existing ﬁles in the
host’s ﬁlesystem, widening access to others. This bug does not directly allow ﬁles to be read, modiﬁed,
or executed without an additional cooperating process.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-41091

A vulnerability was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where the data directory (typically
/var/lib/docker) contained subdirectories with insufﬁciently restricted permissions, allowing other-
wise unprivileged Linux users to traverse directory contents and execute programs. When containers
included executable programs with extended permission bits (such as setuid), unprivileged Linux
users could discover and execute those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the
host collided with the ﬁle owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host
could discover, read, and modify those ﬁles.

A vulnerability was found in the way the “ﬂags” member of the new pipe buffer structure was lacking
proper initialization in copy_page_to_iter_pipe and push_pipe functions in the Linux kernel and could
thus contain stale values. An unprivileged local user could use this to write to pages in the page cache

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-166e461c8d
2021-07-24 01:06:47.807012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : systemd
Product : Fedora 33
Version : 246.15
Release : 1.fc33
URL : <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd>
Summary : System and Service Manager
Description :
systemd is a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts
the rest of the system. It provides aggressive parallelization
capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services,
offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points, and
implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control
logic. systemd supports SysV and LSB init scripts and works as a
replacement for sysvinit. Other parts of this package are a logging daemon,
utilities to control basic system configuration like the hostname,
date, locale, maintain a list of logged-in users, system accounts,
runtime directories and settings, and daemons to manage simple network
configuration, network time synchronization, log forwarding, and name
resolution.

This package was built from the 246.15-stable branch of systemd.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

- Various correctness and potential crash fixes (systemd-journald, udev,
systemctl, systemd, systemd-tmpfiles, systemd-resolved) - Better handling of
very long sysfs paths - Compilation fixes for updated glibc and kernel headers -
Addition of new syscalls to seccomp filters - Latvian and Spanish/Dvorak
keyboard mappings - Shell completion fixes - Ignore FORCERENEW DHCP messages in
systemd-networkd (TALOS-2020-1142, CVE-2020-13529, #1959398) - by-uuid symlinks
for ubifs volumes are now created - CVE-2021-33910, #1984020: an unchecked stack
allocation could be used to crash systemd and cause the system to reboot by
creating a very long fuse mountpoint path. No need to log out or reboot.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1959398#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-05-11 13:10:14 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1959398#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-05-11 13:10:19 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # low, medium, high, urgent (required) severity=medium  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1959397,1959398  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1959398#c2)  Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek    2021-05-11 18:05:03 UTC  ``` We discussed this with the reporters (before public disclosure), and after a lengthy discussion, the asked the reporters to open a public bug. While it's something that could use an improvement, and there's even an RFC, the RFC is not widely supported on the DHCP server side. So even if systemd-networkd gets support, this is not enough to resolve the issue. And vulnerability of DHCP to attacks on the local network is fairly widely understood and probably unavoidable in  general. We're treating this as an RFE upstream, and I'll close this here.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1959398#c3)  Fedora Update System    2021-07-20 17:41:46 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2021-166e461c8d has been submitted as an update to Fedora 33. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2021-166e461c8d>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1959398#c4)  Fedora Update System    2021-07-21 01:15:34 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2021-166e461c8d has been pushed to the Fedora 33 testing repository. Soon you'll be able to install the update with the following command: `sudo dnf upgrade --enablerepo=updates-testing --advisory=FEDORA-2021-166e461c8d` You can provide feedback for this update here: <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2021-166e461c8d>  See also [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA%3AUpdates_Testing) for more information on how to test updates.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1959398#c5)  Fedora Update System    2021-07-24 01:08:09 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2021-166e461c8d has been pushed to the Fedora 33 stable repository. If problem still persists, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).

That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

In 2018, while working on our exploit for CVE-2018-14634 in the Linux
kernel, we accidentally discovered CVE-2018-16864 in systemd (journald);
in our "System Down" advisory we wrote: "Surprised by the heavy usage of
alloca() in journald, we searched for another attacker-controlled
alloca() and found CVE-2018-16865".

Recently, while working on our exploit for CVE-2021-33909 in the Linux
kernel, we accidentally stumbled upon CVE-2021-33910 in systemd (PID 1),
another attacker-controlled alloca():

[https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/MEM05-C.+Avoid+large+stack+allocations](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/MEM05-C.%2BAvoid%2Blarge%2Bstack%2Ballocations)

Although attackers cannot exploit this vulnerability as a "Stack Clash"
to gain privileges (because the alloca()ted buffer is fully written to),
they can exploit it to crash systemd and hence the entire operating
system (a kernel panic). Our proof of concept, a 10-line change in
FUSE's "hello world" program, is attached to this advisory and is
available at:

<https://www.qualys.com/research/security-advisories/>

To the best of our knowledge, this vulnerability was introduced in
systemd v220 (April 2015) by commit 7410616c ("core: rework unit name
validation and manipulation logic"), which replaced a strdup() in the
heap with a strdupa() on the stack.

Note: a similar vulnerability was discovered in 2019 by Chris Coulson
(<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-6454>).

========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================

systemd monitors and parses the contents of /proc/self/mountinfo, and
passes each mountpoint path to mount_setup_unit(), which passes it to
unit_name_from_path(), which passes it to unit_name_path_escape():

1683         r = unit_name_from_path(where, ".mount", &e);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
512 int unit_name_from_path(const char *path, const char *suffix, char **ret) {
...
523         r = unit_name_path_escape(path, &p);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
380 int unit_name_path_escape(const char *f, char **ret) {
...
386         p = strdupa(f);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

At line 386, unit_name_path_escape() passes the mountpoint path to
strdupa(), which is similar to strdup() but allocates memory on the
stack (via alloca()), not in the heap (via malloc()).

As a result, if the total path length of this mountpoint exceeds 8MB
(the default RLIMIT_STACK), then systemd crashes with a segmentation
fault that also crashes the entire operating system (a kernel panic,
because systemd is the "global init", PID 1).

========================================================================
Proof of concept
========================================================================

- First, as an unprivileged local user, we mount a basic FUSE filesystem
  (with FUSE's "hello world" program) to /tmp/hello/world:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ id
uid=65534(nobody) gid=65534(nogroup) groups=65534(nogroup)

$ mkdir -m 0700 -p /tmp/hello/world

$ ./CVE-2021-33910-crasher /tmp/hello/world

$ grep fuse /proc/self/mountinfo | wc
      2      22     239
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Second, we create a deep directory whose total path length exceeds 8MB
  and move our FUSE filesystem to this directory:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ./CVE-2021-33910-crasher /tmp/hello/world /tmp
creating directories, please wait...

$ grep fuse /proc/self/mountinfo | wc
      2      22 8389099
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Third, to force systemd into re-parsing /proc/self/mountinfo (which
  contains our long directory path), we mount another FUSE filesystem
  and therefore crash systemd and the entire operating system:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ mkdir -m 0700 -p /tmp/hello/world

$ ./CVE-2021-33910-crasher /tmp/hello/world

Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Alternatively, because systemd v248 occasionally fails to monitor
  /proc/self/mountinfo (<https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/19464>)
  we force systemd into auto-mounting a filesystem itself; for example,
  the binfmt_misc filesystem:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ systemctl -a list-units '*binfmt_misc*'
  UNIT                              LOAD   ACTIVE   SUB     DESCRIPTION
  proc-sys-fs-binfmt_misc.automount loaded active   waiting Arbitrary...
  proc-sys-fs-binfmt_misc.mount     loaded inactive dead    Arbitrary...

$ cat /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/status

Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

basic/unit-name: do not use strdupa() on a path

The path may have unbounded length, for example through a fuse mount.

[CVE-2021-33910](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5337-wcgc-wcvp "CVE-2021-33910"): attacked controlled alloca() leads to crash in systemd and
ultimately a kernel panic. Systemd parses the content of /proc/self/mountinfo
and each mountpoint is passed to mount_setup_unit(), which calls
unit_name_path_escape() underneath. A local attacker who is able to mount a
filesystem with a very long path can crash systemd and the whole system.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1970887>

The resulting string length is bounded by UNIT_NAME_MAX, which is 256. But we
can't easily check the length after simplification before doing the
simplification, which in turns uses a copy of the string we can write to.
So we can't reject paths that are too long before doing the duplication.
Hence the most obvious solution is to switch back to strdup(), as before

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

basic/unit-name: do not use strdupa() on a path

```
The path may have unbounded length, for example through a fuse mount.

[CVE-2021-33910](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5337-wcgc-wcvp "CVE-2021-33910"): attacked controlled alloca() leads to crash in systemd and
ultimately a kernel panic. Systemd parses the content of /proc/self/mountinfo
and each mountpoint is passed to mount_setup_unit(), which calls
unit_name_path_escape() underneath. A local attacker who is able to mount a
filesystem with a very long path can crash systemd and the whole system.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1970887>

The resulting string length is bounded by UNIT_NAME_MAX, which is 256. But we
can't easily check the length after simplification before doing the
simplification, which in turns uses a copy of the string we can write to.
So we can't reject paths that are too long before doing the duplication.
Hence the most obvious solution is to switch back to strdup(), as before

basic/unit-name: do not use strdupa() on a path

The path may have unbounded length, for example through a fuse mount.

[CVE-2021-33910](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5337-wcgc-wcvp "CVE-2021-33910"): attacked controlled alloca() leads to crash in systemd and
ultimately a kernel panic. Systemd parses the content of /proc/self/mountinfo
and each mountpoint is passed to mount_setup_unit(), which calls
unit_name_path_escape() underneath. A local attacker who is able to mount a
filesystem with a very long path can crash systemd and the whole system.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1970887>

The resulting string length is bounded by UNIT_NAME_MAX, which is 256. But we
can't easily check the length after simplification before doing the
simplification, which in turns uses a copy of the string we can write to.
So we can't reject paths that are too long before doing the duplication.
Hence the most obvious solution is to switch back to strdup(), as before

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
