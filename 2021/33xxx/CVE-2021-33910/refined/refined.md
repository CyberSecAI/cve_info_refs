{
  "CVE": "CVE-2021-33910",
  "description": "The provided content describes a stack exhaustion vulnerability in systemd related to uncontrolled allocation using alloca() within the unit_name_path_escape function. This occurs when parsing mount point paths from /proc/self/mountinfo. A local attacker with the ability to mount filesystems can trigger a crash of systemd, leading to a kernel panic.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `alloca()` function via `strdupa()` in the `unit_name_path_escape` function in systemd. This function does not properly check the size of the input path leading to uncontrolled allocation on the stack.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of `alloca()` with attacker-controlled size.",
      "Unchecked stack allocation in `unit_name_path_escape`."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, resulting in the crash of systemd and a subsequent kernel panic.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attacker mounts a filesystem with an excessively long path."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local attacker with the ability to mount a filesystem with long paths or control mountpoint paths.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in systemd versions 220 through 248. A patch involves switching back to using strdup() which allocates memory on heap."
