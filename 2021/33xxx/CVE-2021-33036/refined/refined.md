Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-33036:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content explicitly mentions "CVE-2021-33036" and "Apache Hadoop Privilege escalation vulnerability."
*   The description aligns with the official CVE description, indicating a privilege escalation issue within Apache Hadoop.
*   NetApp's advisory `NTAP-20220722-0003` is directly related to CVE-2021-33036 and states that multiple NetApp products incorporate the affected versions of Apache Hadoop.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a vulnerability within Apache Hadoop versions `2.2.0 to 2.10.1, 3.0.0-alpha1 to 3.1.4, 3.2.0 to 3.2.2, and 3.3.0 to 3.3.1`.
*   A user who has the ability to escalate to the `yarn` user can potentially execute arbitrary commands with root user privileges.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The core weakness is the ability to escalate from a `yarn` user to `root`, allowing unauthorized access and control.
*   **Improper Access Control:**  There appears to be a flaw in the access controls of Hadoop that allows a user with `yarn` privileges to gain root level privileges.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker, after escalating to `yarn` can run arbitrary commands as root, potentially gaining full control over the system.
*   **Data Modification, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service:** As stated in the NetApp advisory, successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Escalation to `yarn` User:** The primary attack vector involves a user initially gaining access to a system with the ability to escalate to the `yarn` user.
*   **Exploitation of Hadoop Vulnerability:** Once the attacker has privileges of the `yarn` user, they must exploit the vulnerability within Apache Hadoop to escalate to root privileges.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to escalate to `yarn` user:** An attacker must have the ability to escalate their privileges to the `yarn` user. This could be a result of compromised credentials or a vulnerability within the underlying system.
*   **Hadoop Instance:** The system needs to be running a vulnerable version of Apache Hadoop for the exploit to work.
*   **Network Access (Indirect):**  Although not explicitly mentioned, network access to a vulnerable Hadoop service is implied.

**7. Mitigations:**

*   **Upgrade Apache Hadoop:** The primary solution is to upgrade to Apache Hadoop versions `2.10.2, 3.2.3, 3.3.2` or higher.
*   **Remove Privileges for `yarn` Escalation:** As a workaround, if upgrading is not immediately feasible, remove permissions that allow users to escalate to the `yarn` user, specifically if those users do not require root access.

**8. Additional Details:**

*   **NetApp Products:** The vulnerability affects NetApp products that incorporate the specified vulnerable versions of Apache Hadoop. However, the NetApp advisory indicates that **none** of their products are *affected*.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a high CVSS score of 8.8, indicating a significant risk.
*   **Public Discussion:** NetApp is aware of public discussion related to this vulnerability.

**In Summary:**

The provided content highlights a significant privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2021-33036) present in specific versions of Apache Hadoop. Successful exploitation allows attackers to gain root-level access by first escalating to the `yarn` user, enabling them to run arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data compromise or denial of service. Upgrading Apache Hadoop to the recommended fixed versions is the primary mitigation. NetApp has acknowledged the vulnerability, and while its products are not affected, they were noted to incorporate the vulnerable versions of Hadoop.
