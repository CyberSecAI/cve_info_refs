{
  "CVE-2021-33678": {
    "Root cause": "The function module `CONVERT_FROM_CHAR_SORT_RFW` within the function group `FG_RFW` is vulnerable to code injection due to the use of `GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL` with source code created dynamically from untrusted user input.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Code injection",
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Lack of output sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can delete critical system tables (e.g., USR02), rendering the targeted SAP system completely unavailable, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by invoking the vulnerable function module remotely via the RFC protocol.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send RFC calls to the vulnerable SAP system. No specific privilege is mentioned for this call. Exploitation requires the ability to provide malicious input to specific import parameters such as `RTABNAME` and `RFIELDNAME`."
