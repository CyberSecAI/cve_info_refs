Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33655:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the framebuffer console driver. Specifically, a user with access to a framebuffer console device can trigger a memory out-of-bounds write. This occurs when the `FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO` ioctl is used to set screen resolution parameters that are smaller than font size, leading to out-of-bounds memory access when drawing on the screen.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, which is triggered by providing crafted input via the `FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO` ioctl. This ioctl is used to modify the virtual screen information, and lacks proper validation.
- Lack of input validation: The driver does not properly check if the requested screen resolution parameters (xres, yres) are smaller than the font size before applying the changes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: The out-of-bounds write can corrupt memory, which could lead to a system crash (denial of service) or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a local user with access to a framebuffer console device.
- The user interacts with the framebuffer driver by sending a crafted `FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO` ioctl request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to a framebuffer console device.
- Ability to send ioctl requests to the device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding a check to prevent setting a screen size smaller than the font size in `fbcon_modechange_possible()` in `drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbcon.c`.
- There are also checks added in `fb_set_var()` in `drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbmem.c` to verify that virtual resolution is not smaller than physical resolution.
- The fix also addresses related issues such as preventing the setting of a font bigger than the screen size and correcting a logo centering issue.
- The patch was released in Linux kernel version 5.19-rc7.
