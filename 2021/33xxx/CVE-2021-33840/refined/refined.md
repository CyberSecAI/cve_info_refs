- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application relies on client-side storage (indexedDB) to store user information and does not properly validate this data upon check-in.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Lack of server-side validation of user data.
    - Reliance on client-side storage for user authentication.
    - Inability to detect and prevent manipulated client-side data.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Creation of fake check-ins, leading to inaccurate contact tracing.
    - Potential disruption of event management due to data pollution.
    - Difficulty in identifying real attendees amidst fake entries.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Direct manipulation of the browser's indexedDB using JavaScript.
    - Automation through scripting (e.g., Selenium) to quickly populate fake entries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to access the web application.
    - Technical knowledge to manipulate browser's indexedDB using javascript.
    - Ability to execute Javascript code within the browser or through a script.
