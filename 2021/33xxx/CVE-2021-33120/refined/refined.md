Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-33120:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists within the memory subsystem of certain Intel Atom Processors. This occurs under complex microarchitectural conditions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, meaning that the processor might try to access memory outside of the intended bounds.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the memory.
    *   **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability could be exploited to cause a system crash or make the system unavailable.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via network access, but it requires an authenticated user and complex microarchitectural conditions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access. Additionally, exploitation requires precise conditions regarding the microarchitecture to trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as "LOW" severity.
*   Intel has released microcode updates to mitigate the issue.
*   The vulnerability was discovered internally by an Intel employee.
