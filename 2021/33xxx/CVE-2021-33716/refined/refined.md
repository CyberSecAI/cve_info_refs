- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Sensitive information is stored in cleartext within the affected SIMATIC communication processors.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive information by reading the cleartext storage.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with access to the subnet of the affected device can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have network access to the same subnet as the vulnerable device.
