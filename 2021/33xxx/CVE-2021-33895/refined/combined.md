# BACKBOX® Virtual Tape Controller

[Get In Touch](https://etinet.com/contact-us/)

## Latest Release Version

### BackBox-E4.13 - Sep 2024

[![](https://etinet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Download-v4.13.webp)](https://etinet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/BackBox-E4.13-Release-Notes.pdf)

BackBox is an external hardware controller that is managed by NonStop-resident software. BackBox attaches to one or several NonStop servers via FC, HVD SCSI or iSCSI and emulates to up to dozens of tape devices. The NonStop-resident software component, supplied with BackBox, integrates the emulated tape devices and BackBox-attached storage with unmodified HPE backup utilities and tape catalog systems.

Unlike traditional virtual tape systems, every VTC is context-free and depends upon the NonStop server for its configuration and task assignment. Should a VTC require replacement, there is no risk of data loss More importantly, multiple VTCs work together to supply an array of tape devices to an individual NonStop node across multiple channels and with no risk of operational disruption should a single VTC be taken offline. A pair of VTC systems presents sufficient connectivity and performance to provide high-availability support for an entire data center of NonStop servers. BackBox supports Large Block Mode to optimize data transfer. It can connect to virtualized NonStops through iSCSI.
