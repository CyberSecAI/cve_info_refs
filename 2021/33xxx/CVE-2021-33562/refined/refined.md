Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33562:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Shopizer. The application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied data in two specific areas: customer names in the admin panel and the 'ref' parameter in product URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Stored XSS:**  The application stores unsanitized customer names in the database. When this data is retrieved and displayed in the admin panel (e.g., customer details, orders, recent orders), any injected malicious JavaScript code will be executed in the browser of the admin user.
2.  **Reflected XSS:** The application directly uses the `ref` URL parameter in product pages without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript through a crafted URL, which gets executed when a user clicks on it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities allows an attacker to:
*   **Execute arbitrary JavaScript code:** The attacker can run malicious scripts within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** This can lead to stealing session cookies and performing actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could modify content on the page, redirect users to malicious sites, or attempt to phish credentials.
*   **Administrative Access Compromise:** For the stored XSS, an attacker can compromise admin accounts by injecting malicious code that is triggered when they view customer information or orders.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Stored XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious code by modifying a customer's name via the administrative interface. The attack vector is through the "customer_name" field. The payload is stored in the database and executed every time this information is viewed.
2. **Reflected XSS:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload in the `ref` parameter and tricks a user into clicking it. This is done by crafting a malicious URL that includes a script in the `ref` parameter (e.g., `http://example.com/shop/product/vintage-bag-with-leather-bands.html/ref='+alert(1)+'`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Stored XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to access the administrative interface of the Shopizer application to modify customer details and inject the malicious script.
2. **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious link with the injected script in the `ref` parameter, and trick users into accessing it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Exploit-DB entry indicates that the vulnerability exists in Shopizer versions prior to 2.17.0.
* The GitHub commit `197f8c78c8f673b957e41ca2c823afc654c19271` on the shopizer repository shows attempts to mitigate XSS issues by implementing an XSS filter. However, the changes related to the `XssFilter` and `XssHttpServletRequestWrapper` in the commit does not seem to correctly sanitize inputs.  The commit also adds HTML escaping to the `ref` parameter in `ShoppingCategoryController.java`.
*   The Exploit-DB content specifically mentions that the XSS payload will be executed in the "Customers," "Orders," and "Recent orders" sections of the admin panel for the stored XSS.
* The GitHub diff shows that the XSS filter was commented out.
