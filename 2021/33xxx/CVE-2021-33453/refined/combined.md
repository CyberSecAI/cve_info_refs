| Unable to reproduce in master. Hi, I still reproduce the bug ( in the [465afe8](https://github.com/ckolivas/lrzip/commit/465afe830f1432fbccb0e228da1f6e7ed4e79653)) and add two more POCs. I don't know if it is because the multi-thread, maybe you can run it for more times (such as ten times) and test.  ``` ================================================================= ==23189==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free on address 0x61b00001f1e8 at pc 0x000000420c87 bp 0x7ffff26fdd60 sp 0x7ffff26fdd50 READ of size 8 at 0x61b00001f1e8 thread T3     #0 0x420c86 in zpaq_decompress_buf test/lrzip-uaf/git/build_asan/stream.c:449     #1 0x420c86 in ucompthread test/lrzip-uaf/git/build_asan/stream.c:1553     #2 0x7ffff63f06b9 in start_thread (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0+0x76b9)     #3 0x7ffff588551c in clone (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x10751c)  0x61b00001f1e8 is located 104 bytes inside of 1632-byte region [0x61b00001f180,0x61b00001f7e0) freed by thread T0 here:     #0 0x7ffff6f022ca in __interceptor_free (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libasan.so.2+0x982ca)     #1 0x41d2ca in clear_rulist test/lrzip-uaf/git/build_asan/runzip.c:255     #2 0x41d2ca in runzip_chunk test/lrzip-uaf/git/build_asan/runzip.c:383     #3 0x41d2ca in runzip_fd test/lrzip-uaf/git/build_asan/runzip.c:403  previously allocated by thread T0 here:     #0 0x7ffff6f0279a in __interceptor_calloc (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libasan.so.2+0x9879a)     #1 0x425afd in open_stream_in test/lrzip-uaf/git/build_asan/stream.c:1083  Thread T3 created by T0 here:     #0 0x7ffff6ea0253 in pthread_create (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libasan.so.2+0x36253)     #1 0x420df4 in create_pthread test/lrzip-uaf/git/build_asan/stream.c:125  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free /home/aota05/yyp/new_bug/test/lrzip-uaf/git/build_asan/stream.c:449 zpaq_decompress_buf Shadow bytes around the buggy address:   0x0c367fffbde0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c367fffbdf0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c367fffbe00: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c367fffbe10: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 fa fa fa fa   0x0c367fffbe20: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa =>0x0c367fffbe30: fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd[fd]fd fd   0x0c367fffbe40: fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd   0x0c367fffbe50: fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd   0x0c367fffbe60: fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd   0x0c367fffbe70: fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd   0x0c367fffbe80: fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):   Addressable:           00   Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07   Heap left redzone:       fa   Heap right redzone:      fb   Freed heap region:       fd   Stack left redzone:      f1   Stack mid redzone:       f2   Stack right redzone:     f3   Stack partial redzone:   f4   Stack after return:      f5   Stack use after scope:   f8   Global redzone:          f9   Global init order:       f6   Poisoned by user:        f7   Container overflow:      fc   Array cookie:            ac   Intra object redzone:    bb   ASan internal:           fe ==23189==ABORTING  ```  ``` Failed to decompress buffer -
