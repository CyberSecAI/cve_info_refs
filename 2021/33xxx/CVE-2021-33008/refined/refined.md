Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-33008 and related issues in AVEVA System Platform:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The core issue lies within the AutoBuild component of AVEVA System Platform. This component is vulnerable to multiple security flaws. The vulnerabilities, when chained together, lead to significant security risks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The following weaknesses were identified:
*   **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function:** The AutoBuild service lacks proper authentication, allowing unauthorized access to its functionality.
*   **CWE-22: Path Traversal:** The software fails to properly sanitize input, which allows for directory traversal attacks by manipulating pathnames to access files or directories outside of the intended restricted locations.
*   **CWE-346: Origin Validation Error:**  The software does not validate the source of data, which can allow for malicious data injection.
*   **CWE-347: Improper Verification of Digital Signature:** The software does not properly verify cryptographic signatures of data, which can allow an attacker to use manipulated data.
*  **CWE-248: Uncaught Exception:** The software does not handle exceptions, which can lead to denial-of-service attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the vulnerabilities, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with system privileges.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition, disrupting the normal operation of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities are exploitable over the network. The advisory notes that the attack complexity is low, making them easier to exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected system, and possibly be on the adjacent network.
*   **Low Privileges:** For the code execution vulnerability, the attacker needs low privileges on the system. The denial of service vulnerability requires no privileges.

**Affected Versions:**

*   AVEVA System Platform versions 2017 through 2020 R2 P01 (inclusive) are affected.

**Mitigation:**

*   Disable the AutoBuild service on all Runtime nodes.
*   If the AutoBuild functionality is not used, it can also be disabled on the GR Node.
*   Upgrade to a supported version and apply the corresponding security update.

**CVSS Scores:**

*   **AutoBuild Code Execution Vulnerability Chain:** 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   **AutoBuild Denial of Service:** 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
*   The CISA advisory provides more detail, listing the scores of the individual vulnerabilities:
    *   **Missing Authentication for Critical Function:** 8.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
    *   **Uncaught Exception:** 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
    *  **Path Traversal:** 7.2 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
    *   **Origin Validation Error:** 7.2 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
    *   **Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature:** 7.2 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
   

The CISA advisory provides more detail than the initial AVEVA bulletin by providing the specific CWEs and CVSS scores for each of the vulnerabilities that are chained together to create the code execution vulnerability.
