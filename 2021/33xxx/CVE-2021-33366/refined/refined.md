Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33366:

**Verification:**

The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 5411-1) explicitly lists CVE-2021-33366 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in the gpac package update. The commit message in the GitHub content also references the issue #1785, which is titled "memory leak in MP4Box gf_isom_oinf_read_entry" and mentions "fuzz", indicating that it was likely found via fuzzing. The fix in the commit message references `gf_isom_oinf_read_entry` which confirms it is related to the CVE. Thus, the provided content is relevant to CVE-2021-33366.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** A memory leak exists in the `gf_isom_oinf_read_entry` function within the GPAC library when processing MP4 files. Specifically, if the `layer_count` exceeds the size of the `layers_info` array, a memory leak occurs when `gf_free(op)` is called before returning with an error. The structure pointed to by `op` has been partially initialized, but the memory allocated to the `layers_info` array has not been freed which results in a memory leak.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is an improper check on the size of the `layer_count` field which leads to a memory leak when processing a specially crafted MP4 file. The check `if (op->layer_count > GF_ARRAY_LENGTH(op->layers_info))` catches the issue but does not properly free memory when triggered.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The memory leak can lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition by exhausting available memory if an attacker can repeatedly trigger this vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted MP4 file to the GPAC library for processing.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted MP4 file to an application using the vulnerable GPAC library. No other special privileges or access is required.

**Additional Details:**
The fix implemented in commit `0a85029d694f992f3631e2f249e4999daee15cbf` addresses the issue by adding an early exit and freeing the allocated memory when the `layer_count` exceeds `GF_ARRAY_LENGTH(op->layers_info)` which prevents the memory leak.
```c
  if (op->layer_count > GF_ARRAY_LENGTH(op->layers_info)) {
    gf_free(op);
    return GF_NON_COMPLIANT_BITSTREAM;
  }
```
The fix confirms the vulnerability description.
