Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is an XXE (XML External Entity) injection. The application's XML parsing was not properly configured to prevent the inclusion of external entities, which can lead to various attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The application was vulnerable to XXE injection because the XML parser was not configured to disable external entity loading. Specifically, the following features were not disabled:
  - `http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd`
  - `http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities`
  - `http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities`
- The code was using `SAXParser` which is vulnerable if not correctly configured.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially read local files, cause denial of service, or perform other malicious actions by injecting specially crafted XML that includes external entities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could inject malicious XML through any part of the application that processes XML documents, which could include document uploads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject an XML document that the application will parse. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `ce1d82329615aea6aa9f2cc6508c1fe7891e34b5`.
- The fix involved disabling external entity loading in `OpenOfficeTextExtractor.java` and `XMLTextExtractor.java` by setting the following features to false:
  - `http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd`
  - `http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities`
  - `http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities`
  - `http://xml.org/sax/features/validation`
- The vulnerability was reported in issue #287 and fixed in pull request #288.
