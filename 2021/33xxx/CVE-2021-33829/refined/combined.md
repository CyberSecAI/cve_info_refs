# How to upgrade from CKEditor 4 to CKEditor 5

![ ](/blog/upgrade-ckeditor-4-to-5/feature.jpg)

The End of Life for CKEditor 4 is very close â from June 2023, CKEditor 4 no longer receives any upgrades or fixes, including security updates. That means, itâs time to upgrade to CKEditor 5 â the next-generation rich text editor.

## [#](#why-should-you-upgrade) Why should you upgrade?

Yes, youâre probably thinking, âIf it ainât broke, donât fix itâ when it comes to upgrading from CKEditor 4 to CKEditor 5. After all, the end of support/end of life in an editor doesnât mean itâs broken. But it does mean more work for your engineering team, who probably have no time.

**Upgrading from CKEditor 4 to CKEditor 5 isnât just about future-proofing your application. Itâs about giving users access to a next-generation rich text editor.**

[![The new look CKEditor 5 theme](/blog/upgrade-ckeditor-4-to-5/image01.png)

The new look CKEditor 5 theme](/blog/upgrade-ckeditor-4-to-5/image01.png)
## [#](#what-are-the-differences-between-ckeditor-4-and-ckeditor-5) What are the differences between CKEditor 4 and CKEditor 5?

**When it comes to upgrading, itâs important to know there are some breaking changes between CKEditor 4 and CKEditor 5. This means the editor may break if you attempt a straightforward migration.**

However, when you see the differences between the two editors, youâll clearly understand why CKEditor 5 is the editor thatâs been built for the future.

So, what are the eight key differences between CKEditor 4 and CKEditor 5?

1. **New editing engine**

   CKEditor 5 has a custom data model with an MVC architecture and also custom virtual-DOM structures. This allows for complex implementations and features without the burden of the quirks of contentEditable.
2. **Modern UI**

   Its lightweight UI is completely renewed. CKEditor 5 offers an intuitive and seamless user experience that lets you easily manage block elements (tables, quotes, etc), images, links and also includes features like autoformatting, and automatic text transformations.
3. **Powerful APIs**

   CKEditor 5 offers a broader selection of APIs, making it easier to work with and customize, extend, and create custom plugins.
4. **Markdown output**

   The default output of CKEditor 5 is HTML, with an option to change it to Markdown â by simply enabling the Markdown output plugin. This is thanks to the flexibility of the data processor, which allows the editor to produce custom outputs, for example JSON, or XML.
5. **TypeScript**

   CKEditor 5 has typings for TypeScript almost completed. The entire codebase is being progressively migrated to TypeScript, which offers an improved developer experience, since TypeScript performs better in the large, complex projects where CKEditor 5 is often used.
6. **Collaboration ready**

   The architecture of CKEditor 5 was built for collaboration from the get-go. Even real-time collaboration can be set up within hours.
7. **File conversion**

   While CKEditor 4 does offer Export to PDF, CKEditor 5 offers multiple file conversion with both Export to PDF and Export to Word, which are also available as REST API services. Import from Word is also supported in CKEditor 5.
8. **New premium features bundle with Slash commands**

   Slash commands, document outline and table of contents are new features in this bundle of plugins (certain features in this bundle are also available in CKE4). The new Slash commands feature allows you to add styles, elements, and content blocks in a new, more popular way thatâs often used in many applications.

Overall, CKEditor 5 is a far more modern and flexible editor than CKEditor 4. Its modular architecture, content editing model, and performance improvements make it the perfect choice for developers who need a powerful, customizable rich text editor.

### [#](#understanding-licenses) Understanding Licenses

CKEditor 4 was licensed under three open source licenses: GPL, LGPL, and MPL. Understand that CKEditor 5 makes use of a GPL2+ open source license only. For your migration, we can support [you with a no-cost](https://ckeditor.com/contact/) license if youâre using any OSI-approved license not compatible with GPL. If your project is commercial, youâll [need a commercial](https://ckeditor.com/contact/) license.

## [#](#step-by-step-to-upgrade-your-editor-from-ckeditor-4-to-ckeditor-5) Step-by-step to upgrade your editor from CKEditorÂ 4 to CKEditorÂ 5

Below are the steps you need to take to upgrade your editor from CKEditor 4 to CKEditor 5.

**Important**

Due to the new modular architecture of CKEditor 5, this **is considered an entirely new editor installation** and is not a straightforward upgrade process. Make sure you back up all your data before moving to CKEditor 5.

### [#](#step-1-download-and-install-ckeditor-5) Step 1: Download and install CKEditor 5

First, generate your CKEditor installation. You can do this via our [handy Online Builder](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder/), which allows you to customize and download a package designed to your exact specification, or

#### [#](#which-ckeditor-5-installation-method-to-choose) Which CKEditor 5 installation method to choose?

**Easier option**

If youâre looking for an advanced editor implementation, we recommend using the CDN and running the âsuper buildâ. This is available instantly from our CDN and is preconfigured with almost all our plugins and editor types enabled.

**More customized option**

If youâre looking for a simple approach, the [Online Builder](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder/) is the recommended installation path in almost all cases.

#### [#](#sample-of-super-build-code) Sample of âsuper buildâ code

When using the super build, your code should look something like what appears below.

**Note**

The Premium collaboration features, as well as several other plugins, require credentials to work. Without these credentials, the editor will throw an error.

### [#](#step-2-consider-plugin-compatibility) Step 2: Consider plugin compatibility

When it comes to upgrading CKEditor 4 to CKEditor 5, there are a number of considerations to take into account. These include:

1. Custom plugins your engineering team has created
2. Third-party plugins that may not be compatible with CKEditor
3. Plugins created by CKEditor

#### [#](#plugins-created-by-ckeditor) Plugins created by CKEditor

**In order to view plugins that are fully compatible across CKEditor 4 and CKEditor 5, our team has created an [easy-to-read compatibility table](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/ckeditor4/ckeditor4-plugin-compatibility.html).**

Some plugins have been fully deprecated in CKEditor 5, or have been built directly into the core editor and donât require additional configuration. Also note, that where thereâs full compatibility plugins were still redesigned and their configuration options have changed including but not limited to naming or behaviors.

#### [#](#third-party-and-custom-plugins) Third-party and custom plugins

Due to the significant upgrade to CKEditor 5âs underlying architecture and more robust APIs, we cannot guarantee that either third-party or custom plugins youâve created will work error free or without some code changes on your end. In almost all cases we expect that third-part and custom plugins will not work and will need to be completely rewritten.

**We recommend that for every custom plugin you use, read our guide on [how to create a custom plugin for CKEditor 5](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/plugins/creating-simple-plugin-timestamp.html), to make sure you donât risk breaking the editor.**

In addition, if you do have a mission-critical plugin that you need as part of your upgrade path, we do have [service packages available](https://ckeditor.com/contact/) to consult with your engineering team, to help create and configure this on your behalf.

### [#](#step-3-update-plugins) Step 3: Update plugins

**This is the easiest step if youâre taking a fresh new install of CKEditor as was proposed in Step 1 because weâve already inserted all the new plugin names directly into the code for you.**

If you choose to utilize the [CKEditor 5 Online Builder](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder/), the plugins you choose for your editor have already been updated in the file you downloaded. You can skip this step entirely.

**Note**

To ensure your editor continues to work smoothly, itâs important that you update and configure all the plugin names â because theyâve changed in CKEditor 5.

### [#](#step-4-migrate-content-from-ckeditor-4-to-ckeditor-5) Step 4: Migrate content from CKEditor 4 to CKEditor 5

Potentially, one of the most complex steps in migrating from CKEditor 4 to CKEditor 5, is the movement of your existing data from one editor to the other.

**Note**

Because CKEditor 5 utilizes an MVC architecture with a custom data model (as compared to CKEditor 4 HTML-oriented architecture), there may be some data incompatibility issues.

We strongly recommend that as part of the data transfer process, you analyze, verify, and test the data before deleting or removing anything from CKEditor 4. If necessary, you may need to develop conversion procedures to avoid data loss.

**To decrease the risk of any data loss while migrating, weâve created a [General HTML Support](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/general-html-support.html) feature. This can be used to introduce HTML markup that is present in legacy content.**

If you have [access to support as part of your CKEditor Subscription](https://ckeditor.com/pricing/), our support team may be able to help with this process and recommend personalized pathways to minimize any data loss within your editor migration.

### [#](#step-5-test-and-deploy) Step 5: Test and deploy

The best step of your migration is the end of your journey! But make sure to run internal tests before deploying CKeditor 5 to your live environment.

If youâve chosen to deploy CKEditor in a fully-featured way, it should look a little something like below. Feel free to [check out the fully-featured demo](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/demo/feature-rich/) for yourself.

[![](/blog/upgrade-ckeditor-4-to-5/image03.png)](/blog/upgrade-ckeditor-4-to-5/image03.png)
## [#](#what-now) What now?

CKEditor 5 is a powerful modern framework that lets developers build on its collaborative-first editor. Feature-rich and customizable, use it to create any type of in-app content â documents, reports, emails, notes, or chat messages.

If you need help migrating your instance of CKEditor 4 to CKEditor 5, or are wanting to explore options to keep CKEditor 4 running in your application a little longer, [reach out to our sales team](https://ckeditor.com/pricing/) who can help come up with a tailored plan to suit you.

Our engineering team has also put together a more comprehensive migration guide along with FAQâs about the migration process. Please [read the documentation here](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/getting-started/migration-from-ckeditor-4.html).
