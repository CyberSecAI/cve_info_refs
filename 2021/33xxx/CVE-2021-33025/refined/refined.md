Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-33025:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper input validation. The xArrow SCADA product permits unvalidated registry keys to be run with application-level privileges.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Improper Input Validation (CWE-22).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to modify the system. Specifically, the impact is rated as low for confidentiality, high for integrity, and none for availability.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) and must induce a user to perform an action (UI:R).

In summary, the vulnerability allows a local attacker, with low privileges, to potentially gain the ability to modify system integrity by manipulating the registry keys used by the application. User interaction is required for successful exploitation.
