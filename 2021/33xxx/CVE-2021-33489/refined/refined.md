*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the sanitization engine not recognizing specific image formats' media types. This lack of recognition allowed for the injection of HTML and JavaScript code into these files, bypassing sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** Inadequate sanitization of user-provided content when handling specific media types.
*  **Vulnerable component:** backend
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to the execution of malicious scripts within a user's context. This can result in session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface, such as redirects to third-party sites.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker creates a malicious image file containing JavaScript code and shares it via OX Drive sharing.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to create and share files via OX Drive. The victim needs to click a direct link to the shared file.
