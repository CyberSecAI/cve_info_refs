Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2021-33095:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an unquoted search path within the installer for the Intel(R) NUC M15 Laptop Kit Keyboard LED Service driver pack.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The presence of an unquoted search path is the main weakness. This allows an attacker to potentially insert malicious executables in locations that are part of the search path.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to local privilege escalation, meaning an attacker can gain elevated access rights on the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local access. An attacker needs to have some level of access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An authenticated user with local access to the system is required. The attacker would also need to be able to place malicious files in the search path that is vulnerable due to the unquoted path.

In summary, CVE-2021-33095 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability due to an unquoted search path in the Intel NUC M15 Laptop Kit Keyboard LED Service driver installer, which allows an attacker to potentially gain elevated privileges on the system by placing malicious files in the search path.
