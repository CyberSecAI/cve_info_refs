[v5.0.1](/fb55/css-what/tree/v5.0.1)

[`e9106aa`](/fb55/css-what/commit/e9106aa26ece8efbdf85e3219a9f8513897160ab)

**Fixes:**

* Hand-roll attribute parsing ([#503](https://github.com/fb55/css-what/pull/503)) [4cdaacf](https://github.com/fb55/css-what/commit/4cdaacfd0d4b6fd00614be030da0dea6c2994655)
  + Attribute values are slightly more permissive now. Ensures attribute parsing will always be linear.
