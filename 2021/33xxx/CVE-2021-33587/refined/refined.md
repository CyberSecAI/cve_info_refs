Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `css-what` Node.js package, specifically in versions prior to 5.0.1. The vulnerability is due to an insecure regular expression used in the `re_attr` variable, which is used for parsing CSS attribute selectors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):** The insecure regular expression used for parsing CSS attribute selectors is vulnerable to ReDoS. This means that specially crafted CSS input can cause the regex engine to take an excessively long time to process, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition. By providing specially crafted input, an attacker can cause the application to become unresponsive or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `parse` function of the `css-what` package, which processes CSS selectors containing attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to supply specially crafted CSS selectors to an application using the vulnerable `css-what` package.
- The attacker does not require authentication or any special privileges.
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending malicious input to the affected application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The NetApp advisory confirms that multiple of their products incorporate Node.js and that `css-what` package is susceptible to this vulnerability, which could lead to Denial of Service (DoS). Only the "NetApp E-Series Performance Analyzer" was listed as an affected product.
- The Debian security advisory also confirms the vulnerability as a ReDoS, triggered via the parse function.
- The GitHub release notes for `css-what` version 5.0.1 mentions that the fix is a hand-rolled attribute parser that ensures parsing will always be linear. This suggests that the vulnerable regular expression was replaced by a more robust method to prevent ReDoS.
