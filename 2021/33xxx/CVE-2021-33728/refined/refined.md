- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The system allows uploading JSON objects which are then deserialized into JAVA objects. The vulnerability stems from insecure deserialization of user-supplied content.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted serialized Java object within a JSON object.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A privileged attacker is required to exploit this vulnerability.
