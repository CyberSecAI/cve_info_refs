## Phoenix Contact Automationworx BCP File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-782ZDI-CAN-13134

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-33542](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-33542) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Phoenix Contact](https://www.phoenixcontact.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Automationworx |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Phoenix Contact Automationworx. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of BCP files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Phoenix Contact has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

Email |
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/VDE-2021-020/&text=CERT@VDE has released a new advisory: VDE-2021-020: PHOENIX%20CONTACT%3A%20Security%20Advisory%20for%20Automation%20Worx%20Software%20Suite)

#### ID

VDE-2021-020

#### Published

2021-06-23 13:10 (CEST)

#### Last update

2021-06-23 13:10 (CEST)

#### Vendor(s)

PHOENIX CONTACT GmbH & Co. KG

#### Product(s)

| Article No° | Product Name | Affected Version(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Config + | <= 1.87 |
|  | PC Worx | <= 1.87 |
|  | PC Worx Express | <= 1.87 |

#### Summary

Manipulated PC Worx or Config+ projects could lead to a remote code execution when unallocated memory is freed because of incompletely initialized data (CWE-824).
The attacker needs to get access to an original bus configuration file (\*.bcp) to be able to manipulate data inside. After manipulation the attacker needs to exchange the original file by the manipulated one on the application programming workstation.

#### CVE ID

[CVE-2021-33542](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33542)

#### Last Update:

July 7, 2021, 1:08 p.m.

#### Severity

7.0

[(CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)

#### Weakness

Access of Uninitialized Pointer [(CWE-824)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/824.html)

#### Summary

Phoenix Contact Classic Automation Worx Software Suite in Version 1.87 and below is affected by a remote code execution vulnerability. Manipulated PC Worx or Config+ projects could lead to a remote code execution when unallocated memory is freed because of incompletely initialized data. The attacker needs to get access to an original bus configuration file (\*.bcp) to be able to manipulate data inside. After manipulation the attacker needs to exchange the original file by the manipulated one on the application programming workstation. Availability, integrity, or confidentiality of an application programming workstation might be compromised by attacks using these vulnerabilities. Automated systems in operation which were programmed with one of the above-mentioned products are not affected.

#### Details

[nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33542)

---

#### Impact

Availability, integrity, or confidentiality of an application programming workstation might be compromised by attacks using these vulnerabilities.
Automated systems in operation which were programmed with one of the above-mentioned products are not affected.

#### Solution

**Temporary Fix / Mitigation**
We strongly recommend customers to exchange project files only using secure file exchange services. Project files should not be exchanged via unencrypted email.

**Remediation**
With the next version of Automationworx Software Suite the affected data will be initialized completely and thereby freeing of unallocated memory will be prevented.

#### Reported by

The vulnerability was discovered by Francis Provencher {PRL} and reported by Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
PHOENIX CONTACT thanks CERT@VDE for the coordination and support with this publication.
