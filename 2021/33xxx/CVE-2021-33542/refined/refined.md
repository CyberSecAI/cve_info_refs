Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of BCP (bus configuration) files. This leads to a memory corruption condition.
*   Specifically, unallocated memory is freed due to incompletely initialized data when processing manipulated project files. This is due to an access of uninitialized pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The improper handling of user-supplied data in BCP files leads to memory corruption.
*   **Access of Uninitialized Pointer (CWE-824):** Incompletely initialized data causes a pointer to unallocated memory to be freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the affected system.
*   **Compromise of Application Programming Workstation:** The availability, integrity, or confidentiality of the workstation can be compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious BCP File:** The attacker needs to manipulate a BCP file. This file is then opened by the target user.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The target user must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious BCP file.
*   **File Exchange:** The attacker needs to get access to an original BCP file, manipulate it, and then exchange the original file with the manipulated one on the application programming workstation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to BCP File:** The attacker needs access to an original BCP file to be able to manipulate it.
*   **Ability to Deliver Malicious File:** The attacker needs a way to get the manipulated BCP file onto the target system, requiring some level of access or social engineering to get the target user to open it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Phoenix Contact Automationworx software.
*   The vulnerability affects versions 1.87 and below of the Automation Worx software suite, including Config+, PC Worx, and PC Worx Express.
*   Automated systems in operation are not affected, only the application programming workstation.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Francis Provencher {PRL} and reported by Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
