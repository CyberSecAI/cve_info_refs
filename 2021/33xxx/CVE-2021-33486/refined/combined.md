• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
• Activate and apply user management and password features
• Use encrypted communication links
• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
• Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions
