- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled search path in the software installer for Intel(R) System Studio.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The installer uses an uncontrolled search path which could allow for malicious code to be loaded and executed during the installation process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to escalate their privileges on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system. The user interface requires some user interaction (UI:R) for the exploitation to occur.
