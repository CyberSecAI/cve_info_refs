Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33009:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of restrictions on file uploads, specifically related to dangerous file types. The application does not properly validate the type of file being uploaded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434):** The application allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to the file system without any type validation or restriction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to upload malicious files which could then be executed on the server, potentially leading to a wide range of attacks including remote code execution, defacement, or data breaches.  The impact is rated as high for integrity compromise, but no impact on confidentiality or availability in this specific vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network
- **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target myPRO server.
- **No privileges required:** The attacker can be unauthenticated.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is part of a set of security issues discovered in mySCADA myPRO versions prior to 8.20.0.
- mySCADA recommends updating to version 8.20.0 or later to mitigate this issue.
- CISA recommends network segmentation, firewalls, and VPN usage to minimize risks.
- The CVSS v3 score for this vulnerability is 7.5 with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).

**Summary:**
CVE-2021-33009 details a critical security vulnerability in mySCADA myPRO versions prior to 8.20.0 that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to upload arbitrary files. The absence of file type validation makes it possible for malicious actors to introduce and potentially execute harmful files on the affected system. This flaw highlights a significant risk to systems using vulnerable versions of myPRO.
