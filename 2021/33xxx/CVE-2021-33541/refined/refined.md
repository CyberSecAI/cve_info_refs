- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The communication protocols and device access of Phoenix Contact Classic Line industrial controllers (ILC1x0 and ILC1x1) lack authentication measures. This allows remote attackers to send specially crafted IP packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper resource allocation without limits or throttling (CWE-770), leading to a denial of service. Lack of authentication for device access and communication protocols.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack leads to a denial of service on the PLC's network communication module, stopping all network communication. The device needs to be restarted to restore network connectivity. The automation task itself is not affected.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted IP packets to the vulnerable PLC's network communication module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required.
