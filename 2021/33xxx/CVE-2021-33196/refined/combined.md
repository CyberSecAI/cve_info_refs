Debian Bug     : 989492 991961

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Go programming
language. An attacker could trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) and
information leak.

CVE-2021-33196

    In archive/zip, a crafted file count (in an archive's header) can
    cause a NewReader or OpenReader panic.

CVE-2021-36221

    Go has a race condition that can lead to a net/http/httputil
    ReverseProxy panic upon an ErrAbortHandler abort.

CVE-2021-39293

    Follow-up fix to CVE-2021-33196

CVE-2021-41771

    ImportedSymbols in debug/macho (for Open or OpenFat) accesses a
    Memory Location After the End of a Buffer, aka an out-of-bounds
    slice situation.

CVE-2021-44716

    net/http allows uncontrolled memory consumption in the header
    canonicalization cache via HTTP/2 requests.

CVE-2021-44717

    Go on UNIX allows write operations to an unintended file or
    unintended network connection as a consequence of erroneous
    closing of file descriptor 0 after file-descriptor exhaustion.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1.8.1-1+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your golang-1.8 packages.

For the detailed security status of golang-1.8 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/golang-1.8>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Debian Bug     : 989492 991961

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the Go programming
language. An attacker could trigger a denial-of-service (DoS), invalid
cryptographic computation, information leak, or arbitrary code
execution on the developer's computer in specific situations.

CVE-2020-28367

    Code injection in the go command with cgo allows arbitrary code
    execution at build time via malicious gcc flags specified via a
    #cgo directive.

CVE-2021-33196

    In archive/zip, a crafted file count (in an archive's header) can
    cause a NewReader or OpenReader panic.

CVE-2021-36221

    Go has a race condition that can lead to a net/http/httputil
    ReverseProxy panic upon an ErrAbortHandler abort.

CVE-2021-38297

    Go has a Buffer Overflow via large arguments in a function
    invocation from a WASM module, when GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js is used.

CVE-2021-39293

    This issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-33196.

CVE-2021-41771

    ImportedSymbols in debug/macho (for Open or OpenFat) Accesses a
    Memory Location After the End of a Buffer, aka an out-of-bounds
    slice situation.

CVE-2021-44716

    net/http allows uncontrolled memory consumption in the header
    canonicalization cache via HTTP/2 requests.

CVE-2021-44717

    Go on UNIX allows write operations to an unintended file or
    unintended network connection as a consequence of erroneous
    closing of file descriptor 0 after file-descriptor exhaustion.

CVE-2022-23806

    Curve.IsOnCurve in crypto/elliptic can incorrectly return true in
    situations with a big.Int value that is not a valid field element.

CVE-2022-24921

    regexp.Compile allows stack exhaustion via a deeply nested
    expression.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.11.6-1+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your golang-1.11 packages.

For the detailed security status of golang-1.11 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/golang-1.11>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

We have just released Go versions 1.16.5 and 1.15.13, minor point releases.

These minor releases include security fixes according to the new security policy ([#44918](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/44918)).

The SetString and UnmarshalText methods of [math/big.Rat](https://pkg.go.dev/math/big#Rat) may cause a panic or an unrecoverable fatal error if passed inputs with very large exponents.
This is issue [#45910](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/44910) and CVE-2021-33198.

Thanks to the OSS-Fuzz project for discovering this issue and to Emmanuel Odeke for reporting it.

ReverseProxy in [net/http/httputil](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/httputil) could be made to forward certain hop-by-hop headers, including Connection. In case the target of the ReverseProxy was itself a reverse proxy, this would let an attacker drop arbitrary headers, including those set by the ReverseProxy.Director.
This is issue [#46313](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/46313) and CVE-2021-33197.

Thanks to Mattias Grenfeldt ([https://grenfeldt.dev](https://grenfeldt.dev/)) and Asta Olofsson for reporting this issue.

The LookupCNAME, LookupSRV, LookupMX, LookupNS, and LookupAddr functions in [net](https://pkg.go.dev/net), and their respective methods on the [Resolver](https://pkg.go.dev/net#Resolver) type may return arbitrary values retrieved from DNS which do not follow the established [RFC 1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035)rules for domain names. If these names are used without further sanitization, for instance unsafely included in HTML, they may allow for injection of unexpected content. Note that LookupTXT may still return arbitrary values that could require sanitization before further use.
This is issue [#46241](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/46241) and CVE-2021-33195.

Thanks to Philipp Jeitner and Haya Shulman from Fraunhofer SIT for reporting this issue.

The NewReader and OpenReader functions in [archive/zip](https://pkg.go.dev/archive/zip) can cause a panic or an unrecoverable fatal error when reading an archive that claims to contain a large number of files, regardless of its actual size.
This is issue[#46242](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/46242)and CVE-2021-33196.

Thanks to the OSS-Fuzz project for discovering this issue and to Emmanuel Odeke for reporting it.

View the release notes for more information:
    <https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.16.minor>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go web site:
    <https://golang.org/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with
"git checkout go1.16.5" and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,
David and Carlos for the Go team

# Go: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **202208-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Go, the worst of which could result in remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/go** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.18.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.18.5** |

### Background

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Go. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Please review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Go users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/go-1.18.5"

```

In addition, users using Portage 3.0.9 or later should ensure that packages with Go binaries have no vulnerable code statically linked into their binaries by rebuilding the @golang-rebuild set:

```
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose @golang-rebuild

```

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

## Release Policy

supported until the Go 1.8 release.
We fix critical problems, including [critical security problems](/security),
in supported releases as needed by issuing minor revisions
