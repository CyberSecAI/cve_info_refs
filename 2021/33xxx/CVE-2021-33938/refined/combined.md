| Description: There are two heap-buffer overflow vulnerabilities in static void prune\_to\_recommended(Solver \*solv, Queue \*plist) at src/policy.c: line 403 & line 514 FOR\_PROVIDES(p, pp, rec) MAPSET(&solv->recommendsmap, p); // line 403 The first case, it involves variable “solv->recommendsmap”. The libsolv defines MAPSET as following: #define MAPSET(m, n) ((m)->map[(n) >> 3] |= 1 << ((n) & 7)) Therefore, MAPSET(&solv->recommendsmap, p) involves the variable “solv->recommendsmap->map[p >> 3]”. The type of the variable “solv->recommendmap” is the structure Map. The Map structure defines as following: typedef struct s\_Map { unsigned char \*map; int size; } Map; If the value of the index variable “p>>3” is bigger than “solv->recommendmap->size”, there will be a heap-buffer overflow bug.  if (!MAPTST(&solv->recommendsmap, p)) // line 514 The libsolv defines MAPTST as following: #define MAPTST(m, n) ((m)->map[(n) >> 3] & (1 << ((n) & 7))). Therefore, the variable “MAPTST(&solv->recommendsmap, p)” is same with “solv->recommendmap->map[p >> 3] & (1 << (p & 7))”. It also causes a heap overflow bug as the first bug. Our PoC files can trigger these two heap overflow bugs.  Please reproduce this issue through the following PoC: /libsolvBuildDir/tools/testsolv [PoC-policy\_update\_recommendsmap-403](https://github.com/yangjiageng/PoC/blob/master/libsolv-PoCs/PoC-policy_update_recommendsmap-403) If you configure CC with flag -fsanitize=address, you will get
