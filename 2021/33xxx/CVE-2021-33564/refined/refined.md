      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of arguments passed to the ImageMagick `convert` utility within the `dragonfly` gem when the `verify_url` option is disabled.",

      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to a server running an application using a vulnerable version of the `dragonfly` gem and must be able to craft malicious URLs that the server will process. The `verify_url` option needs to be disabled."
