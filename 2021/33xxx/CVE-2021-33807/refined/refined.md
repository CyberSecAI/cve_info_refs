Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue in the Gespage software. This occurs because the application does not properly validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to manipulate file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Directory Traversal: The application allows the attacker to use special characters (like "../") in file paths. This enables them to navigate outside of the web server's root directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized File Access: An attacker can read sensitive files that are not intended to be publicly accessible, potentially leading to data breaches.
- Server Compromise: In severe cases, this vulnerability can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands and the complete compromise of the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP requests to specific endpoints:
    - `/gespage/doDownloadData`
    - `/gespage/webapp/doDownloadData`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. They do not need to be authenticated, although this detail is not specified.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected versions: Gespage v8.2.1 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was found by Olivier Thibault of ON-X.
