{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Magento 2 Help Desk extension from Wyomind is vulnerable to stored XSS, directory traversal, and unrestricted file upload of dangerous file types. These vulnerabilities, when combined, can lead to remote code execution.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored XSS: An attacker can inject a malicious XSS payload via the ticket message from the front-end, which is triggered when an administrator views the ticket in the Magento 2 backend.",
    "Directory Traversal: The application allows the setting of the attachment directory to an arbitrary path using directory traversal sequences, e.g., 'helpdesk/files/../../../pub'.",
    "Unrestricted File Upload: The application allows the upload of dangerous file types, such as 'phar', by adding them to the allowed file extensions."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack involves a combination of multiple vulnerabilities. First, an XSS payload is sent in a ticket message. This payload, when viewed by an administrator, is used to modify the extension's configuration to allow the upload of a 'phar' file and sets the upload directory to a location within the webroot. Then, a 'phar' file containing malicious code is uploaded as an attachment to a ticket. Finally, the attacker requests the uploaded file via its direct path, triggering the execution of the code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send ticket messages via the front-end of the application. They also need to be able to trigger the XSS payload by sending the message and have an administrator view the ticket in the backend. After that, they must craft a malicious phar file and know how to execute it."
