- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `iw_console conio_writestr` functionality, specifically how it handles a time server entry.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of externally controlled format string vulnerability (CWE-134). A specially crafted time server entry can cause an overflow of the time server buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted commands to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated as a low-privilege user to trigger the vulnerability.
