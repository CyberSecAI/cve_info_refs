Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-33091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insecure inherited permissions in the installer for the Intel(R) NUC M15 Laptop Kit audio driver pack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The installer for the audio driver pack, prior to version 1.3, has insecure inherited permissions. This means the permissions granted to the installer are not properly restricted, potentially allowing for unauthorized access or modification of the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An authenticated user could potentially exploit this vulnerability to escalate their privileges on the system via local access. This could allow the attacker to gain higher level access, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local access is required.
*   The attacker must be an authenticated user on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have an account on the affected system.
*   They need to be able to run the vulnerable installer or otherwise interact with the affected components to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable only if the audio driver pack is not updated to a version >= 1.3.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.7 (Medium), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. This indicates that the attack requires local access, has a high attack complexity, requires a low level of privilege, user interaction is required, and there is an impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
