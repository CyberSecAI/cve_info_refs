- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incomplete cleanup of malicious files uploaded to public shares. Specifically, the files were detected as malicious by the antivirus scanner, but were not subsequently deleted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incomplete cleanup (CWE-459). The system failed to properly remove files flagged as malicious by the antivirus scan.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious files could persist within publicly shared folders, potentially leading to further compromise or malicious activity. Although the description notes the files are detected as malicious, it's important to consider that they could still be present and that the system has failed to delete them. It also indicates there is a possibility of loss of availability for files, as the malicious files are not properly removed and could potentially take up space. The vulnerability allows for a low impact on integrity, as the files are still detected.
- **Attack vectors:** Uploading files to a publicly shared folder.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to upload files to a public share, which may be possible with basic user access. The attacker does not require special privileges.
