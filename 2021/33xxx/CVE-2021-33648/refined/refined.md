Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability arises from an out-of-bounds access during the inference shape operation of certain operators (Affine, Concat, MatMul, ArgMinMax, EmbeddingLookup, and Gather) in MindSpore.
- Specifically, if the input shape size is 0, the code attempts to access data outside the allocated heap buffer boundaries used to store shape information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The code accesses memory locations beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is described as accessing data outside the bounds of shape which allocated from heap buffers, this suggests memory corruption or a crash may occur if exploited. However, the specific severity of the impact like information leakage or arbitrary code execution isn't explicitly stated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Input manipulation: An attacker could craft a model with specific input tensors that have a shape size of 0 which will trigger the vulnerability during shape inference.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to feed a crafted input to the affected operators in MindSpore. This suggests an attacker needs to have control over the input data to the model.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.3.0 of MindSpore.
- A patch is also available.
- The vulnerability was reported by Wang Xuan(@May) of Qihoo 360 AIVul Team.
- The CVE is not yet assigned but is noted as "To be updated".
