Advisory #45

| Title | RebornCore (Minecraft Mod) deserialization of untrusted data in network stack |
| --- | --- |
| CVE ID | CVE-2021-33790 |
| Vendor | Team Reborn |
| Affected product | RebornCore |
| Affected versions | - 4.7.2, - 4.2.9, - 3.19.4 |
| Vulnerability type | CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data |
| Description | RebornCore uses ObjectInputStream.readObject() to deserialize some packet data after being sent over the minecraft packet pipeline. However RebornCore opens up this up to maliciouly crafted data from untrusted Minecraft servers and clients by not validating the data before deserialization. Which may allow a malicious server/client to execute arbitrary codes. |
| Status | Fixed in 4.7.3, 4.2.10, 3.19.5 |
| Recommendation | Update to fixed version. |

# Deserialization of Untrusted Data in RebornCore's network stack

High

[modmuss50](/modmuss50)
published
GHSA-r7pg-4xrf-7mrm
May 30, 2021

## Package

reborncore.common.network.ExtendedPacketBuffer
(Minecraft Modification)

## Affected versions

>= 3.13.8, <4.7.3

## Patched versions

4.7.3

## Description

### Impact

RebornCore is a popular library used by a number of modifications for the game [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net/). RebornCore has been downloaded over 50,000,000 times from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/reborncore) among other places. It is estimiated that this version of RebornCore is running on 1000's of vulnerable server's and millions of vulnerable clients.

RebornCore uses `ObjectInputStream.readObject()` to deserialize some packet data after being sent over the minecraft packet pipeline. However RebornCore opens up this up to maliciouly crafted data from untrusted Minecraft servers and clients by not validating the data before deserialization.

This can **theoretically** lead to a number of diffrent outcomes:

* Remote Code Exectution on a hosted Minecraft server from a malicous client.
* Remote Code Exectution on a Minecraft client from a malicous server.
* Denial of Service (DoS) of a Minecraft server.
* Gaining an advantage over other players on a target Minecraft server.

This works becuase when ObjectInputStream is reading a serialized object the input data controls what class is instantiated and not the deserializer. This would allow an attacker to instantiate any class on the classpath with any data. To successfully execute any of the above attacks it would require a suitable target class to be present on the classpath. The chances of this would be higer with a large amount of other Minecraft mods also installed.

There are no known cases of this vulnerability beign explolited in the wild.

### Patches

A patch has be released for the following Minecraft versions:

| Minecraft Version | Mod Loader | Fix Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.16.5 | Fabric | 4.7.3 |
| 1.15.2 | Fabric | 4.2.10 |
| 1.12.2 | Forge | 3.19.5 |

If you are using any other version you must update to a supported Minecraft version and ensure you are using a patched RebornCore version.

### Workarounds

* There are **no** known workarounds for server owners who have not updated to the patched version.
* For players you must not join any untrusted Minecraft servers with the affected RebornCore installed on your client.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
