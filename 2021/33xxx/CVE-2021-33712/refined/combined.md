PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Mendix SAML Module allows you to use SAML to authenticate your users in your cloud application.
This module can communicate with any identity provider that supports SAML2.0 or Shibboleth.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-33712

The conﬁguration of the SAML module does not properly check various restrictions and validations
imposed by an identity provider.

This could allow a remote authenticated attacker to escalate privileges.
