**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   A crafted HTTP/2 method can bypass validation.
    *   When forwarded via `mod_proxy`, this can lead to request splitting or cache poisoning.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Improper handling of HTTP/2 method validation.
    *   Inadequate security checks in mod\_proxy when handling HTTP/2 requests.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Request Splitting:** An attacker could inject additional requests within a single HTTP/2 connection, potentially confusing the backend server.
    *   **Cache Poisoning:** An attacker could manipulate the response stored in a cache, serving malicious content to other users.
    *   **Data Modification:** According to the NetApp advisory, successful exploitation can lead to addition or modification of data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Malicious HTTP/2 requests.
    *   Exploiting a vulnerable reverse proxy setup with HTTP/2.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to send HTTP/2 requests.
    *   Target server must have mod\_proxy enabled and improperly configured to handle the vulnerable HTTP/2 requests.

**3. Additional Details from the Content (Beyond the CVE Description):**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.17 to 2.4.48.
