## CVE-2021-33850 – Stored Cross-Site Scripting in WordPress Microsoft Clarity Plugin

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/medium.png)

Severity:Medium

#### Vendor

##### Microsoft

#### Affected Product

##### Microsoft Clarity version 0.3

#### CVE

##### CVE-2021-33850

#### Securin ID

##### 2020-CSW-10-1050

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### October 18, 2021

### Description

A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Microsoft Clarity version 0.3 can cause arbitrary code to run in a userâs browser while the browser is connected to a trusted website. The XSS payload executes whenever the user changes the clarity configuration in Microsoft Clarity version 0.3 stored on the configuring project ID page.

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

The following vulnerability was detected in WordPress Microsoft Clarity Plugin version 0.3.

1. Log in to the WordPress application.
2. Install Microsoft Clarity plugin to your WordPress application.

***Figure 1: Microsoft Clarity Plugin Installation***

3. Click on Settings, and the Clarity Setting page appears.

***Figure 2: Microsoft Clarity Settings Page***

4. In the Clarity Settings page, enter the payload in the âproject IDâ section (clarity\_project\_id parameter).

5. Injected XSS payload gets executed whenever the user changes the clarity configuration page.

### Impact

An attacker can control a script executed in the victim’s browser and fully compromise the targeted user. In addition, an XSS vulnerability enables attacks that are contained within the application itself. There is no need to find an external way of inducing the victim to make a request containing their exploit. Instead, the attacker places the exploit inside the application itself and simply waits for users to encounter it, thus, resulting in the following:

* Stealing cookies,
* End-user files disclosure,
* Installation of Trojan horse programs,
* Redirection of the user to some other page or site.

### Remediations

1. Perform context-sensitive encoding of untrusted input before it is echoed back to a browser by using the encoding library.
2. Implement input validation for special characters on all the variables reflected in the browser and stored in the database.
3. Implement client-side validation.
