- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code into the "Link Name" field when adding a top bar link. This unsanitized input is then stored and displayed on any page within the CRM.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can inject malicious code into the vulnerable application via the XSS vulnerability.
    - Session information of other users could potentially be obtained.
    - User machines can be compromised.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker needs to be an administrator user to inject the payload.
    - The injected payload is triggered when any other user browses any page within the CRM application
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator privileges within the X2CRM application.
