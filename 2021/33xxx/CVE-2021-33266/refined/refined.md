Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow located in the `formVirtualApp.htm` page of the D-Link DIR-809 router's firmware.
- The `get_var` function extracts user-controlled input from an HTTP POST request. Specifically, the value associated with keys of the format `name_%d` is extracted.
- The extracted string is then copied into a stack buffer using `strcpy` without any bounds checking, leading to a stack overflow if the input string is too long.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The use of `strcpy` without checking the length of the input data allows an attacker to overwrite stack memory.
- **Unsanitized User Input:** User-supplied data is directly used in memory operations without validation, allowing the attacker to control the data being copied to the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address and other critical data on the stack, leading to the execution of arbitrary code on the router.
- **Device Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete control of the vulnerable router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP POST requests to the `/formVirtualApp.htm` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the router. This could be from the local network or potentially from the internet if the router's management interface is exposed.
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests with a specific structure containing the overflowing `name_%d` parameter.
- The content mentions the attacker can control the string `pcVar2`.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability using a crafted HTTP POST request with a long string provided for the name_0 parameter.
- The vulnerability is present in the DIR-809Ax\_FW1.12WWB03\_20190410 firmware version and was confirmed by the vendor.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and TIANGONG Team of Legendsec at Qi'anxin Group.
