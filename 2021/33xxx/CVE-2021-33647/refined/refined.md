The provided content is related to CVE-2021-33647.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability occurs in the `Tile` operator's inference shape operation within MindSpore. If the input data type is not `int` or `int32`, it results in out-of-bounds access of heap-allocated buffers.

**Weaknesses:**
- Improper input validation. The `Tile` operator does not correctly validate the input data type.
- Out-of-bounds read: The vulnerability leads to a heap out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can trigger an out-of-bounds read by providing an input of a non-integer data type to the affected `Tile` operator during inference shape calculations. This could potentially lead to denial of service due to program crashes or information disclosure depending on the surrounding memory layout, though the advisory specifically mentions out-of-bounds reads.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through supplying a specially crafted input tensor with a non-integer data type to the `Tile` operator within a MindSpore model.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need the ability to execute a MindSpore model and control the input data being fed into the model. This means that they would need to be able to create or modify the model such that the vulnerable Tile operator receives the crafted input.
