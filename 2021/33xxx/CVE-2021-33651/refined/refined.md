The provided content is a security advisory for a vulnerability identified as MSSA-2021-004, which is related to a division by zero error within the MindSpore project. Although the content does not directly mention the CVE, it provides sufficient information to identify it and is therefore considered relevant.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A division by zero error occurs in the `DepthwiseConv2D` operator when the `depth_multiplier` attribute is set to 0.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code lacks proper input validation or handling of the `depth_multiplier` attribute, leading to a division by zero error.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The division by zero error causes an exception during the analytical operation of the `DepthwiseConv2D` operator. This can lead to a crash or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit this by crafting a specific input with `depth_multiplier` set to 0. This input will cause the vulnerable code to perform a division by zero, triggering the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input that includes a `DepthwiseConv2D` operator with the `depth_multiplier` attribute set to 0. This might be achieved through a specially crafted model or input data.
