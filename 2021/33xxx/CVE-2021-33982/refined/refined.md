  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application uses a customerId parameter in a POST request to retrieve license information without proper authorization checks, allowing access to other users' data. Additionally, the authorization token does not expire in a timely manner.",

    "attack_vectors": [
      "An authenticated user can change the \"customerId\" parameter in a POST request to the \"getcustomerlicense\" endpoint.",
      "An attacker can reuse the non-expiring \"Authorization\" parameter in API communications."
