{
  "CVE-2021-33256": {
    "Description": "ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus 6.1 is vulnerable to CSV injection. An unauthenticated user can inject a payload in the 'j_username' parameter which is saved in the 'User Attempts Audit Report'. If an administrator exports this report as a CSV, the injected payload is executed.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-controlled input before including it in a CSV file, allowing for the injection of malicious code in cells.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "CSV Injection",
       "Improper Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the administrator's machine upon opening the exported CSV file using spreadsheet software. A reverse shell can be obtained.",
    "Attack vectors": [
       "Malicious input via the login page 'j_username' parameter.",
       "Exploitation requires an administrator to export a report to CSV and open it with spreadsheet software."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "An attacker needs network access to the login page of ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus 6.1.",
      "The attacker does not need authentication credentials to inject the payload.",
       "Requires an administrator to take action after the attacker submits the malicious input."
    ]
  }
