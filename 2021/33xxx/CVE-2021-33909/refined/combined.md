# Security advisories.

## Software flaws found by Qualys.

The Qualys Vulnerability and Malware Research Labs (VMRL) is tasked with the investigation of software packages to find new flaws. Once found, we work with the software owner to get the flaw registered (CVEs), and then we assist with the quickest resolution possible by providing detailed technical information, including proof of concept code.

This list of advisories provides insight into the specific vulnerabilities reported.

Subject: Containers-optimized OS (COS) membership in the linux-distros list

Hello,

I’d like to propose Container-Optimized OS (COS)  for membership in
linux-distros. Text below addresses items listed in the “Membership
criteria” section of
<https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros>

> 1. Be an actively maintained Unix-like operating system distro with
> substantial use of Open Source components

Container-Optimized OS (COS) s a Chromium OS based
server operating system. Google distributes COS as a pre-built cloud image,
but also provides sources for users to customize and build their own
specialized versions of the OS.

URL: <https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os>

Source code:  <https://cos.googlesource.com>
Build instructions:
<https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/how-to/building-from-open-source>

COS has a 6-month major release cadence and 3 LTS branches with their own
3-month refresh cadence. Critical security vulnerabilities addressed in
patch releases, independently from the release/refresh cycle.

Release notes: <https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/release-notes>

> 2. Have a user base not limited to your own organization

COS is available directly to external customers as a base VM image for the
Google Compute Engine and indirectly as a base OS for managed services such
as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), CloudSQL, Google Cloud Filestore.
Overall usage of COS adds up to millions of cloud instances.

> 3. Have a publicly verifiable track record, dating back at least 1 year and
> continuing to present day, of fixing security issues (including some that
> had been handled on (linux-)distros, meaning that membership would have
> been relevant to you) and releasing the fixes within 10 days (and
> preferably much less than that) of the issues being made public (if it
> takes you ages to fix an issue, your users wouldn't substantially benefit
> from the additional time, often around 7 days and sometimes up to 14 days,
> that list membership could give you)

Some of the examples of COS reacting quickly (less than 7 days) to CVEs
with high impact:

CVE-2021-33909(Sequoia):
<https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/release-notes/m85#cos-85-13310-1308-6>

CVE-2020-14308, CVE-2020-14311, CVE-2020-15705 (GRUB2):
<https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/release-notes/m81#cos-81-12871-1185-0>

CVE-2020-14386:
<https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/release-notes/m81#cos-81-12871-1196-0>

Having access to embargoed CVEs would have helped us to plan and prepare
for patch releases in a more proactive way.

> 4. Not be (only) downstream or a rebuild of another distro (or else we need
> convincing additional justification of how the list membership would enable
> you to release fixes sooner, presumably not relying on the upstream distro
> having released their fixes first?)

Although COS is derived from Chromium OS we switched to maintaining our own
kernel package that tracks more recent versions of the Linux kernel. We
make an effort to keep it as close to the upstream kernel as possible. We
also track releases of other open-source packages relevant for our use
cases independently from Chromium OS or Gentoo.

> 5. Be a participant and preferably an active contributor in relevant public
> communities (most notably, if you're not watching for issues being made
> public on oss-security, which are a superset of those that had been handled
> on (linux-)distros, then there's no valid reason for you to be on
> (linux-)distros)

We are actively monitoring multiple sources of information about
vulnerabilities but haven’t contributed much directly because we didn't
have anything to add to discussions.  We contributed to OSTIF Linux Kernel
Vuln Reporting/Remediation Practices review, and also monitor the
oss-security indirectly via ChromeOS.

> 6. Accept the list policy:
> <http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#list-policy-and-instructions-for-members>

Please consider this note as acceptance of the list policy.

> 7. Be able and willing to contribute back, preferably in specific ways
> announced in advance (so that you're responsible for a specific area and so
> that we know what to expect from which member), and demonstrate actual
> contributions once you've been a member for a while:
> <http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#contributing-back>

Our team can perform administrative tasks that benefit the wider community
and also can draw upon Google’s internal kernel expertise if required (on
the need-to-know basis, maintaining confidentiality).

> 8. Be able and willing to handle PGP-encrypted e-mail

We’ll provide relevant GPG keys separately if our membership is accepted.

> 9. Have someone already on the private list, or at least someone else who
> has been active on oss-security for years but is not affiliated with your
> distro nor your organization, vouch for at least one of the people
> requesting membership on behalf of your distro (then that one vouched-for
> person will be able to vouch for others on your team, in case you'd like
> multiple people subscribed)

Kees Cook (Cc-ed) can vouch for the proposed candidates.

Thank you

There is no reasonable need for a buffer larger than this, and it avoids
int overflow pitfalls.

Package        : linux
Version        : 4.9.272-2
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-3609 CVE-2021-21781 CVE-2021-33909 CVE-2021-34693
Debian Bug     : 990072

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

This updated advisory text fills in information omitted in the
original advisory.

CVE-2021-3609

    Norbert Slusarek reported a race condition vulnerability in the CAN
    BCM networking protocol, allowing a local attacker to escalate
    privileges.

CVE-2021-21781

    "Lilith >_>" of Cisco Talos discovered that the Arm initialisation
    code does not fully initialise the "sigpage" that is mapped into
    user-space processes to support signal handling.  This could
    result in leaking sensitive information, particularly when the
    system is rebooted.

CVE-2021-33909

    The Qualys Research Labs discovered a size_t-to-int conversion
    vulnerability in the Linux kernel's filesystem layer. An
    unprivileged local attacker able to create, mount, and then delete a
    deep directory structure whose total path length exceeds 1GB, can
    take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation.

    Details can be found in the Qualys advisory at
    <https://www.qualys.com/2021/07/20/cve-2021-33909/sequoia-local-privilege-escalation-linux.txt>

CVE-2021-34693

    Norbert Slusarek discovered an information leak in the CAN BCM
    networking protocol. A local attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.272-2.  This additionally fixes a regression in the previous
update (#990072) that affected LXC.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

For the detailed security status of linux please refer to

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-36311 CVE-2021-3609 CVE-2021-33909 CVE-2021-34693

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2020-36311

    A flaw was discovered in the KVM subsystem for AMD CPUs, allowing an
    attacker to cause a denial of service by triggering destruction of a
    large SEV VM.

CVE-2021-3609

    Norbert Slusarek reported a race condition vulnerability in the CAN
    BCM networking protocol, allowing a local attacker to escalate
    privileges.

CVE-2021-33909

    The Qualys Research Labs discovered a size_t-to-int conversion
    vulnerability in the Linux kernel's filesystem layer. An
    unprivileged local attacker able to create, mount, and then delete a
    deep directory structure whose total path length exceeds 1GB, can
    take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation.

    Details can be found in the Qualys advisory at
    <https://www.qualys.com/2021/07/20/cve-2021-33909/sequoia-local-privilege-escalation-linux.txt>

CVE-2021-34693

    Norbert Slusarek discovered an information leak in the CAN BCM
    networking protocol. A local attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.19.194-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

For the detailed security status of linux please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux>

Subject: Re: Containers-optimized OS (COS) membership in the linux-distros list

Hello Oleksandr,

You posted this from @google.com, which probably means many subscribers
didn't receive the message because of that domain's strict DMARC policy.
So I fully quote your message below for others to possibly comment.

BTW, you will similarly need to be posting from another domain (e.g.,
gmail.com) to the linux-distros list.

Overall, your proposal looks reasonable to me at first glance.

Please also propose which specific contributing-back task(s) your team
would like to help with.

Thanks,

Alexander

Sorry, I wasn't aware about the problem with @google.com. Replying
from the email address I use for my OSS communications (supposedly
has DKIM and SPF configured). If this one is OK, I'll use it instead.

I think we can help with the following tasks:

Help ensure that each message posted to oss-security contains the most
essential information (e.g., vulnerability detail and/or exploit)
directly in the message itself (and in plain text) rather than only by
reference to an external resource, and add the missing information
(e.g., in your own words, by quoting with proper attribution, and/or
by creating and attaching a properly attributed text/plain export of a
previously referenced web page) and remind the original sender of this
requirement (for further occasions) in a “reply” posting when
necessary

Determine if the reported issues are Linux-specific, and if so help
ensure that (further) private discussion goes on the linux-distros
sub-list only (thus, not spamming and unnecessarily disclosing to the
non-Linux distros)

Promptly review new issue reports for meeting the list's requirements
and confirm receipt of the report and, when necessary, inform the
reporter of any issues with their report (e.g., obviously not actionable
by the distros) and request and/or propose any required yet missing
information (most notably, a tentative public disclosure date/time)

## Security Resources

With the ever prevalent threats that span todayâs landscape, NetApp continues
to derive and provide security solutions across the portfolio. Links to
security resources are found below. As always, stay tuned because just like the
threat landscape, these resources are ever changing and being updated!

#### Products and Solutions

The product and solutions resources provide guidance, recommendations, and best
practices with regard to security elements and configurations amongst the
NetApp portfolio.

##### ONTAP

[ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3846.pdf) - The
ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet provides a comprehensive list of security features
and functions available in ONTAP 9 - So if the question is, âwhat are all the
security features/functions in ONTAP 9?â, This is your resource!

[Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP
9](https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4569.pdf) - We humbly refer to the
Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP 9 as your key resource when it comes
to answering the question, âhow do I deploy ONTAP 9 in the most secure
fashion?â. The hardening guide provides the recommended commands and configs
necessary to enable ONTAP 9 in the most secure configuration.

[ONTAP 9 Encryption Power
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Security_and_data_encryption.pdf)

* When it comes to understanding the configuration and management details of NSE and NVE,
  including deployment, certificates, onboard key management and more, the Power
  Guide is the key resource!

[ONTAP 9 Network Management
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Network_management.pdf) - While
this guide provides vast elements surrounding ONTAP networking (IPv4, v6,
IPSpaces, and more), it also captures some key security elements such as
managing SVMs, protocol restrictions and firewall configuration in addition to
control plane elements such as DNS, SNMP, FIPS configuration, and MTU details.
The Network Management Guide also shows list of ports used in ONTAP, also
listed in the hardening guide.

[ONTAP 9 Manage administrator authentication and RBAC with the
CLI](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/authentication/)

* You can enable login accounts for ONTAP cluster administrators and storage virtual machine (SVM) administrators.
  You can also use role-based access control (RBAC) to define the capabilities of administrators.

  management and name mapping for multiprotocol NAS access in ONTAP.

[DS-3898: NetApp Storage Encryption and NetApp Volume
Encryption](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3898.pdf) - When it comes to
encryption at rest there are many questions about the capabilities. The NSE and
NVE Datasheet seeks to quell such questions by providing a comprehensive
understanding of what NSE is, what NVE is, use cases, and how they can be
leveraged individually or together for a true dual/double encryption solution.

[NetApp Storage Encryption
Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3213-en.pdf) - The NSE Datasheet
provides a holistic overview of the NSE solution and use cases. If you have
ever wondered what NSE is, what we mean by self encrypting drives, or what
encryption algorithm is in use, this is the resource for you!

Threat resources consist of guidance to address known threats through a
combination of prevention, mitigation, and remediation.

##### Ransomware

[The NetApp Solution for
Ransomware](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4572.pdf) - Ransomware wages war
on every environment. Being the custodians of one of the worldâs most valuable
resources (data/information), itâs imperative that we protect it. When it comes
to ransomware, this is your guide to addressing and remediating the threat.

[NetApp and Varonis ransomware white

Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

##### Key Management

[NetApp ONTAP 9 External Key Management: Vormetric Key Management Integration
Guide](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4618.pdf) - The Vormetric integration

Version        : 4.9.272-2
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-3609 CVE-2021-21781 CVE-2021-33909 CVE-2021-34693
Debian Bug     : 990072

Brief introduction

CVE-2021-3609

    Norbert Slusarek reported a race condition vulnerability in the CAN
    BCM networking protocol, allowing a local attacker to escalate
    privileges.

CVE-2021-21781

    "Lilith >_>" of Cisco Talos discovered that the Arm initialisation
    code does not fully initialise the "sigpage" that is mapped into
    user-space processes to support signal handling.  This could
    result in leaking sensitive information, particularly when the
    system is rebooted.

CVE-2021-33909

    The Qualys Research Labs discovered a size_t-to-int conversion
    vulnerability in the Linux kernel's filesystem layer. An
    unprivileged local attacker able to create, mount, and then delete a
    deep directory structure whose total path length exceeds 1GB, can
    take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation.

    Details can be found in the Qualys advisory at
    <https://www.qualys.com/2021/07/20/cve-2021-33909/sequoia-local-privilege-escalation-linux.txt>

CVE-2021-34693

    Norbert Slusarek discovered an information leak in the CAN BCM
    networking protocol. A local attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.272-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1970273#c0)  Rohit Keshri    2021-06-10 08:17:13 UTC  ``` An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the seq_file in Filesystem layer, where a local attacker with a user privilege could gain access to out-of-bound memory leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The issue results from not validating the size_t-to-int conversion prior to performing operations. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity, confidentiality and system availability.  While creating, mounting, and deleting a deep directory structure whose total path length exceeds 1GB, an unprivileged local attacker can write the 10-byte string "//deleted" to an offset of exactly -2GB-10B below the beginning of a vmalloc()ated kernel buffer.

Subject: Re: CVE-2021-33909: size_t-to-int vulnerability in Linux's filesystem
 layer

Hi all,

A few people have asked us how we discovered CVE-2021-33909
(size_t-to-int conversion vulnerability in Linux's filesystem layer):

- We were reading (not auditing) the kernel code that generates some of
  the files in /proc/pid. We eventually reached seq_read_iter() and
  noticed the "while (1) { ... m->size <<= 1 ... }".

- We immediately wondered if there was a limit to this exponential
  growth; there was none. Next, we searched for /proc/pid seq_files
  whose records could become very large; and we knew from CVE-2020-28010
  that directory paths on Linux can be much longer than PATH_MAX.

- So we found show_mountinfo() (which generates /proc/pid/mountinfo) and
  the signed int buflen in the subsequent dentry_path(), which led to
  the out-of-bounds write of the "//deleted" string.

We are at your disposal for questions, comments, and further
discussions. Thank you very much! With best regards,

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

perf tools: Fix pattern matching for same substring in different PMU type
[ Upstream commit c47a5599eda324bacdacd125227a0925d6c50fbe ]
Some different PMU types may have the same substring. For example, on
Icelake server we have PMU types "uncore\_imc" and
"uncore\_imc\_free\_running". Both PMU types have the substring
"uncore\_imc". But the parser wrongly thinks they are the same PMU type.
We enable an imc event,
perf stat -e uncore\_imc/event=0xe3/ -a -- sleep 1
Perf actually expands the event to:
uncore\_imc\_0/event=0xe3/
uncore\_imc\_1/event=0xe3/
uncore\_imc\_2/event=0xe3/
uncore\_imc\_3/event=0xe3/
uncore\_imc\_4/event=0xe3/
uncore\_imc\_5/event=0xe3/
uncore\_imc\_6/event=0xe3/
uncore\_imc\_7/event=0xe3/
uncore\_imc\_free\_running\_0/event=0xe3/
uncore\_imc\_free\_running\_1/event=0xe3/
uncore\_imc\_free\_running\_3/event=0xe3/
uncore\_imc\_free\_running\_4/event=0xe3/
That's because the "uncore\_imc\_free\_running" matches the
pattern "uncore\_imc\*".
Now we check that the last characters of PMU name is '\_'.
For example, for pattern "uncore\_imc\*", "uncore\_imc\_0" is parsed ok, but
"uncore\_imc\_free\_running\_0" fails.

MIPS: vdso: Invalid GIC access through VDSO
[ Upstream commit 47ce8527fbba145a7723685bc9a27d9855e06491 ]
Accessing raw timers (currently only CLOCK\_MONOTONIC\_RAW) through VDSO
doesn't return the correct time when using the GIC as clock source.
The address of the GIC mapped page is in this case not calculated
correctly. The GIC mapped page is calculated from the VDSO data by
subtracting PAGE\_SIZE:
void \*get\_gic(const struct vdso\_data \*data) {
return (void \_\_iomem \*)data - PAGE\_SIZE;
}
However, the data pointer is not page aligned for raw clock sources.
This is because the VDSO data for raw clock sources (CS\_RAW = 1) is
stored after the VDSO data for coarse clock sources (CS\_HRES\_COARSE = 0).
Therefore, only the VDSO data for CS\_HRES\_COARSE is page aligned:
+--------------------+
| |
| vd[CS\_RAW] | ---+
| vd[CS\_HRES\_COARSE] | |
+--------------------+ | -PAGE\_SIZE
| | |
| GIC mapped page | <--+
| |
+--------------------+
When \_\_arch\_get\_hw\_counter() is called with &vd[CS\_RAW], get\_gic returns
the wrong address (somewhere inside the GIC mapped page). The GIC counter
values are not returned which results in an invalid time.

perf script python: Fix buffer size to report iregs in perf script
[ Upstream commit dea8cfcc33695f70f56023b416cf88ae44c8a45a ]
Commit 48a1f565261d2ab1 ("perf script python: Add more PMU fields to
event handler dict") added functionality to report fields like weight,
iregs, uregs etc via perf report. That commit predefined buffer size to
512 bytes to print those fields.
But in PowerPC, since we added extended regs support in:
068aeea3773a6f4c ("perf powerpc: Support exposing Performance Monitor Counter SPRs as part of extended regs")
d735599a069f6936 ("powerpc/perf: Add extended regs support for power10 platform")
Now iregs can carry more bytes of data and this predefined buffer size
can result to data loss in perf script output.
This patch resolves this issue by making the buffer size dynamic, based
on the number of registers needed to print. It also changes the
regs\_map() return type from int to void, as it is not being used by the
set\_regs\_in\_dict(), its only caller.

mips: always link byteswap helpers into decompressor
[ Upstream commit cddc40f5617e53f97ef019d5b29c1bd6cbb031ec ]
My series to clean up the unaligned access implementation
across architectures caused some mips randconfig builds to
fail with:
mips64-linux-ld: arch/mips/boot/compressed/decompress.o: in function `decompress\_kernel':
decompress.c:(.text.decompress\_kernel+0x54): undefined reference to `\_\_bswapsi2'
It turns out that this problem has already been fixed for the XZ
decompressor but now it also shows up in (at least) LZO and LZ4. From my
analysis I concluded that the compiler could always have emitted those
calls, but the different implementation allowed it to make otherwise
better decisions about not inlining the byteswap, which results in the
link error when the out-of-line code is missing.
While it could be addressed by adding it to the two decompressor
implementations that are known to be affected, but as this only adds
112 bytes to the kernel, the safer choice is to always add them.

sched/uclamp: Ignore max aggregation if rq is idle
[ Upstream commit 3e1493f46390618ea78607cb30c58fc19e2a5035 ]
When a task wakes up on an idle rq, uclamp\_rq\_util\_with() would max
aggregate with rq value. But since there is no task enqueued yet, the
values are stale based on the last task that was running. When the new
task actually wakes up and enqueued, then the rq uclamp values should
reflect that of the newly woken up task effective uclamp values.
This is a problem particularly for uclamp\_max because it default to
1024. If a task p with uclamp\_max = 512 wakes up, then max aggregation
would ignore the capping that should apply when this task is enqueued,
which is wrong.
Fix that by ignoring max aggregation if the rq is idle since in that
case the effective uclamp value of the rq will be the ones of the task
that will wake up.

kbuild: remove trailing slashes from $(KBUILD\_EXTMOD)
[ Upstream commit 74ee585b7eecd98be3650e677625a0ee588d08e0 ]
M= (or KBUILD\_EXTMOD) generally expects a directory path without any
trailing slashes, like M=a/b/c.
If you add a trailing slash, like M=a/b/c/, you will get ugly build
logs (two slashes in a series), but it still works fine as long as it
is consistent between 'make modules' and 'make modules\_install'.
The following commands correctly build and install the modules.
$ make M=a/b/c/ modules
$ sudo make M=a/b/c/ modules\_install
Since commit ccae4cfa7bfb ("kbuild: refactor scripts/Makefile.modinst"),
a problem happens if you add a trailing slash only for modules\_install.
$ make M=a/b/c modules
$ sudo make M=a/b/c/ modules\_install
No module is installed in this case, Johannes Berg reported. [1]
Trim any trailing slashes from $(KBUILD\_EXTMOD).
I used the 'dirname' command to remove all the trailing slashes in
case someone adds more slashes like M=a/b/c/////. The Make's built-in
function, $(dir ...) cannot take care of such a case.

The current device tree CPSW3g node adds non-zero "mac-address" property to
the ports, which prevents random MAC address assignment to network devices
if bootloader failed to update DT. This may cause more then one host to
have the same MAC in the network.
mac-address = [00 00 de ad be ef];
mac-address = [00 01 de ad be ef];
In addition, there is one MAC address available in eFuse registers which
can be used for default port 1.
Hence, fix ports MAC properties by:
- resetting "mac-address" property to 0
- adding ti,syscon-efuse = <&main\_conf 0x200> to Port 1

However, the earlier definition in [2] was not removed, and this

USB4 is only present in DRA74x variants, so keeping the entry in

arm64: dts: allwinner: a64-sopine-baseboard: change RGMII mode to TXID
[ Upstream commit bd5431b2f9b30a70f6ed964dd5ee9a6d1c397c06 ]
Although the schematics of Pine A64-LTS and SoPine Baseboard shows both
the RX and TX internal delay are enabled, they're using the same broken
RTL8211E chip batch with Pine A64+, so they should use TXID instead, not
ID.
In addition, by checking the real components soldered on both a SoPine
Baseboard and a Pine A64-LTS, RX delay is not enabled (GR69 soldered and
GR70 NC) despite the schematics says it's enabled. It's a common
situation for Pine64 boards that the NC information on schematics is not
the same with the board.
So the RGMII delay mode should be TXID on these boards.

firmware: arm\_scmi: Reset Rx buffer to max size during async commands
[ Upstream commit 0cb7af474e0dbb2f500c67aa62b6db9fafa74de2 ]
During an async commands execution the Rx buffer length is at first set
to max\_msg\_sz when the synchronous part of the command is first sent.
However once the synchronous part completes the transport layer waits
for the delayed response which will be processed using the same xfer
descriptor initially allocated. Since synchronous response received at
the end of the xfer will shrink the Rx buffer length to the effective
payload response length, it needs to be reset again.
Raise the Rx buffer length again to max\_msg\_sz before fetching the
delayed response to ensure full response is read correctly from the
shared memory.

soc: mtk-pm-domains: Fix the clock prepared issue
[ Upstream commit f0fce06e345dc4f75c1cdd21840780f5fe2df1f3 ]
In this new power domain driver, when adding one power domain
it will prepare the dependent clocks at the same.
So we only do clk\_bulk\_enable/disable control during power ON/OFF.
When system suspend, the pm runtime framework will forcely power off
power domains. However, the dependent clocks are disabled but kept
prepared.
In MediaTek clock drivers, PLL would be turned ON when we do
clk\_bulk\_prepare control.
Clock hierarchy:
PLL -->
DIV\_CK -->
CLK\_MUX
(may be dependent clocks)
-->
SUBSYS\_CG
(may be dependent clocks)
It will lead some unexpected clock states during system suspend.
This patch will fix by doing prepare\_enable/disable\_unprepare on
dependent clocks at the same time while we are going to power on/off
any power domain.

b) The 3rd "reg" "is a serdes region and qmp\_v3\_dp\_serdes\_tbl contains

I think because the 3rd "reg" is a serdes region we should just use

ARM: dts: stm32: Rework LAN8710Ai PHY reset on DHCOM SoM
[ Upstream commit 1cebcf9932ab76102e8cfc555879574693ba8956 ]
The Microchip LAN8710Ai PHY requires XTAL1/CLKIN external clock to be
enabled when the nRST is toggled according to datasheet Microchip
LAN8710A/LAN8710Ai DS00002164B page 35 section 3.8.5.1 Hardware Reset:
"
A Hardware reset is asserted by driving the nRST input pin low. When
driven, nRST should be held low for the minimum time detailed in
Section 5.5.3, "Power-On nRST & Configuration Strap Timing," on page
59 to ensure a proper transceiver reset. During a Hardware reset, an
external clock must be supplied to the XTAL1/CLKIN signal.
"
This is accidentally fulfilled in the current setup, where ETHCK\_K is used
to supply both PHY XTAL1/CLKIN and is also fed back through eth\_clk\_fb to
supply ETHRX clock of the DWMAC. Hence, the DWMAC enables ETHRX clock,
that has ETHCK\_K as parent, so ETHCK\_K clock are also enabled, and then
the PHY reset toggles.
However, this is not always the case, e.g. in case the PHY XTAL1/CLKIN
clock are supplied by some other clock source than ETHCK\_K or in case
ETHRX clock are not supplied by ETHCK\_K. In the later case, ETHCK\_K would
be kept disabled, while ETHRX clock would be enabled, so the PHY would
not be receiving XTAL1/CLKIN clock and the reset would fail.
Improve the DT by adding the PHY clock phandle into the PHY node, which
then also requires moving the PHY reset GPIO specifier in the same place
and that then also requires correct PHY reset GPIO timing, so add that
too.
A brief note regarding the timing, the datasheet says the reset should
stay asserted for at least 100uS and software should wait at least 200nS
after deassertion. Set both delays to 500uS which should be plenty.

Tag the highest "Power Optimized" (1.5 GHz) Cortex-A57 operating point
table entries for the RZ/G2M, R-Car M3-W and M3-W+ SoCs with the

arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845-oneplus-common: guard rmtfs-mem
[ Upstream commit e60fd5ac1f6851be5b2c042b39584bfcf8a66f57 ]
The rmtfs\_mem region is a weird one, downstream allocates it
dynamically, and supports a "qcom,guard-memory" property which when set
will reserve 4k above and below the rmtfs memory.
A common from qcom 4.9 kernel msm\_sharedmem driver:
/\*
\* If guard\_memory is set, then the shared memory region
\* will be guarded by SZ\_4K at the start and at the end.
\* This is needed to overcome the XPU limitation on few
\* MSM HW, so as to make this memory not contiguous with
\* other allocations that may possibly happen from other
\* clients in the system.
\*/
When the kernel tries to touch memory that is too close the
rmtfs region it may cause an XPU violation. Such is the case on the
OnePlus 6 where random crashes would occur usually after boot.
Reserve 4k above and below the rmtfs\_mem to avoid hitting these XPU
Violations.
This doesn't entirely solve the random crashes on the OnePlus 6/6T but
it does seem to prevent the ones which happen shortly after modem
bringup.

rtc: fix snprintf() checking in is\_rtc\_hctosys()
[ Upstream commit 54b909436ede47e0ee07f1765da27ec2efa41e84 ]
The scnprintf() function silently truncates the printf() and returns
the number bytes that it was able to copy (not counting the NUL
terminator). Thus, the highest value it can return here is
"NAME\_SIZE - 1" and the overflow check is dead code. Fix this by
using the snprintf() function which returns the number of bytes that
would have been copied if there was enough space and changing the
condition from "> NAME\_SIZE" to ">= NAME\_SIZE".

rtc: bd70528: fix BD71815 watchdog dependency
[ Upstream commit b0ddc5b170058a9ed3c9f031501d735a4eb8ee89 ]
The added Kconfig dependency is slightly incorrect, which can
lead to a link failure when the watchdog is a loadable module:
arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: drivers/rtc/rtc-bd70528.o: in function `bd70528\_set\_rtc\_based\_timers':
rtc-bd70528.c:(.text+0x6cc): undefined reference to `bd70528\_wdt\_set'

arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: rtc-bd70528.c:(.text+0x1030): undefined reference to `bd70528\_wdt\_unlock'
The problem is that it allows to be built-in if MFD\_ROHM\_BD71828
is built-in, even when the watchdog is a loadable module.
Rework this so that having the watchdog as a loadable module always
forces the rtc to be a module as well instead of built-in,
regardless of bd71828.

hexagon: handle {,SOFT}IRQENTRY\_TEXT in linker script
[ Upstream commit 6fef087d0d37ba7dba8f3d75566eb4c256cd6742 ]
Patch series "hexagon: Fix build error with CONFIG\_STACKDEPOT and select CONFIG\_ARCH\_WANT\_LD\_ORPHAN\_WARN".
This series fixes an error with ARCH=hexagon that was pointed out by the
patch "mm/slub: use stackdepot to save stack trace in objects".
The first patch fixes that error by handling the '.irqentry.text' and
'.softirqentry.text' sections.
The second patch switches Hexagon over to the common DISCARDS macro, which
should have been done when Hexagon was merged into the tree to match
commit 023bf6f1b8bf ("linker script: unify usage of discard definition").
The third patch selects CONFIG\_ARCH\_WANT\_LD\_ORPHAN\_WARN so that something
like this does not happen again.
This patch (of 3):
Patch "mm/slub: use stackdepot to save stack trace in objects" in -mm
selects CONFIG\_STACKDEPOT when CONFIG\_STACKTRACE\_SUPPORT is selected and
CONFIG\_STACKDEPOT requires IRQENTRY\_TEXT and SOFTIRQENTRY\_TEXT to be
handled after commit 505a0ef15f96 ("kasan: stackdepot: move
filter\_irq\_stacks() to stackdepot.c") due to the use of the
\_\_{,soft}irqentry\_text\_{start,end} section symbols. If those sections are
not handled, the build is broken.

are updated in order. That's not necessarily the case.
Instead of using the value of lo->plh\_outstanding as a guesstimate for
the window of values we need to accept, just wait to update the window
until we're processing the last one. The intention here is just to
ensure that we don't process 2^31 seqid updates without also updating

NFS: Fix fscache read from NFS after cache error
[ Upstream commit ba512c1bc3232124567a59a3995c773dc79716e8 ]
Earlier commits refactored some NFS read code and removed
nfs\_readpage\_async(), but neglected to properly fixup
nfs\_readpage\_from\_fscache\_complete(). The code path is
only hit when something unusual occurs with the cachefiles
backing filesystem, such as an IO error or while a cookie
is being invalidated.
Mark page with PG\_checked if fscache IO completes in error,
unlock the page, and let the VM decide to re-issue based on
PG\_uptodate. When the VM reissues the readpage, PG\_checked
allows us to skip over fscache and read from the server.

commit e0340f16a08d031de54ed91d26f57c9a966a776a upstream.
A previous refactoring of nfs\_readpage() might end up calling
wait\_on\_page\_locked\_killable() even if readpage\_async\_filler() failed
with an internal error and pg\_error was non-zero (for example, if
nfs\_create\_request() failed). In the case of an internal error,
skip over wait\_on\_page\_locked\_killable() as this is only needed
when the read is sent and an error occurs during completion handling.

powerpc/bpf: Fix detecting BPF atomic instructions
[ Upstream commit 419ac821766cbdb9fd85872bb3f1a589df05c94c ]
Commit 91c960b0056672 ("bpf: Rename BPF\_XADD and prepare to encode other
atomics in .imm") converted BPF\_XADD to BPF\_ATOMIC and added a way to
distinguish instructions based on the immediate field. Existing JIT
implementations were updated to check for the immediate field and to
reject programs utilizing anything more than BPF\_ADD (such as BPF\_FETCH)
in the immediate field.
However, the check added to powerpc64 JIT did not look at the correct
BPF instruction. Due to this, such programs would be accepted and

nvme-tcp: can't set sk\_user\_data without write\_lock

The sk\_user\_data pointer is supposed to be modified only while
holding the write\_lock "sk\_callback\_lock", otherwise
we could race with other threads and crash the kernel.
we can't take the write\_lock in nvmet\_tcp\_state\_change()
because it would cause a deadlock, but the release\_work queue
will set the pointer to NULL later so we can simply remove

vdp/mlx5: Fix setting the correct dma\_device

Before SF support was introduced, the DMA device was equal to
mdev->device which was in essence equal to pdev->dev.
With SF introduction this is no longer true. It has already been
handled for vhost\_vdpa since the reference to the dma device can from
within mlx5\_vdpa. With virtio\_vdpa this broke. To fix this we set the
real dma device when initializing the device.
In addition, for the sake of consistency, previous references in the

arch\_topology: Avoid use-after-free for scale\_freq\_data
[ Upstream commit 83150f5d05f065fb5c12c612f119015cabdcc124 ]
Currently topology\_scale\_freq\_tick() (which gets called from
scheduler\_tick()) may end up using a pointer to "struct
scale\_freq\_data", which was previously cleared by
topology\_clear\_scale\_freq\_source(), as there is no protection in place
here. The users of topology\_clear\_scale\_freq\_source() though needs a
guarantee that the previously cleared scale\_freq\_data isn't used
anymore, so they can free the related resources.
Since topology\_scale\_freq\_tick() is called from scheduler tick, we don't
want to add locking in there. Use the RCU update mechanism instead
(which is already used by the scheduler's utilization update path) to
guarantee race free updates here.
synchronize\_rcu() makes sure that all RCU critical sections that started
before it is called, will finish before it returns. And so the callers
of topology\_clear\_scale\_freq\_source() don't need to worry about their
callback getting called anymore.

nfs: update has\_sec\_mnt\_opts after cloning lsm options from parent
[ Upstream commit eae00c5d6e48ccb2d78ae5873743d7d1a572951b ]
After calling security\_sb\_clone\_mnt\_opts() in nfs\_get\_root(), it's
necessary to copy the value of has\_sec\_mnt\_opts from the cloned
super\_block's nfs\_server. Otherwise, calls to nfs\_compare\_super()
using this super\_block may not return the correct result, leading to
mount failures.
For example, mounting an nfs server with the following in /etc/exports:
/export \*(rw,insecure,crossmnt,no\_root\_squash,security\_label)
and having /export/scratch on a separate block device.
mount -o v4.2,context=system\_u:object\_r:root\_t:s0 server:/export/test /mnt/test
mount -o v4.2,context=system\_u:object\_r:swapfile\_t:s0 server:/export/scratch /mnt/scratch
The second mount would fail with "mount.nfs: /mnt/scratch is busy or
already mounted or sharecache fail" and "SELinux: mount invalid. Same
superblock, different security settings for..." would appear in the
syslog.
Also while we're in there, replace several instances of "NFS\_SB(s)"
with "server", which was already declared at the top of the
nfs\_get\_root().

x86/fpu: Fix copy\_xstate\_to\_kernel() gap handling
[ Upstream commit 9625895011d130033d1bc7aac0d77a9bf68ff8a6 ]
The gap handling in copy\_xstate\_to\_kernel() is wrong when XSAVES is in
use.
Using init\_fpstate for copying the init state of features which are
not set in the xstate header is only correct for the legacy area, but
not for the extended features area because when XSAVES is in use then
init\_fpstate is in compacted form which means the xstate offsets which
are used to copy from init\_fpstate are not valid.
Fortunately, this is not a real problem today because all extended
features in use have an all-zeros init state, but it is wrong
nevertheless and with a potentially dynamically sized init\_fpstate this
would result in an access outside of the init\_fpstate.
Fix this by keeping track of the last copied state in the target buffer and
explicitly zero it when there is a feature or alignment gap.
Use the compacted offset when accessing the extended feature space in
init\_fpstate.
As this is not a functional issue on older kernels this is intentionally
not tagged for stable.

SUNRPC: prevent port reuse on transports which don't request it.
[ Upstream commit bc1c56e9bbe92766d017efb5f0a0c71f80da5570 ]
If an RPC client is created without RPC\_CLNT\_CREATE\_REUSEPORT, it should
not reuse the source port when a TCP connection is re-established.
This is currently implemented by preventing the source port being
recorded after a successful connection (the call to xs\_set\_srcport()).
However the source port is also recorded after a successful bind in xs\_bind().
This may not be needed at all and certainly is not wanted when
RPC\_CLNT\_CREATE\_REUSEPORT wasn't requested.
So avoid that assignment when xprt.reuseport is not set.
With this change, NFSv4.1 and later mounts use a different port number on
each connection. This is helpful with some firewalls which don't cope
well with port reuse.

um: Fix stack pointer alignment
[ Upstream commit 558f9b2f94dbd2d5c5c8292aa13e081cc11ea7d9 ]
GCC assumes that stack is aligned to 16-byte on call sites [1].
Since GCC 8, GCC began using 16-byte aligned SSE instructions to
implement assignments to structs on stack. When
CC\_OPTIMIZE\_FOR\_PERFORMANCE is enabled, this affects
os-Linux/sigio.c, write\_sigio\_thread:
struct pollfds \*fds, tmp;
tmp = current\_poll;
Note that struct pollfds is exactly 16 bytes in size.
GCC 8+ generates assembly similar to:
movdqa (%rdi),%xmm0
movaps %xmm0,-0x50(%rbp)
This is an issue, because movaps will #GP if -0x50(%rbp) is not
aligned to 16 bytes [2], and how rbp gets assigned to is via glibc
clone thread\_start, then function prologue, going though execution
trace similar to (showing only relevant instructions):
sub $0x10,%rsi
mov %rcx,0x8(%rsi)
mov %rdi,(%rsi)
syscall
pop %rax
pop %rdi
callq \*%rax
push %rbp
mov %rsp,%rbp
The stack pointer always points to the topmost element on stack,
rather then the space right above the topmost. On push, the
pointer decrements first before writing to the memory pointed to
by it. Therefore, there is no need to have the stack pointer
pointer always point to valid memory unless the stack is poped;
so the `- sizeof(void \*)` in the code is unnecessary.
On the other hand, glibc reserves the 16 bytes it needs on stack
and pops itself, so by the call instruction the stack pointer
is exactly the caller-supplied sp. It then push the 16 bytes of
the return address and the saved stack pointer, so the base
pointer will be 16-byte aligned if and only if the caller
supplied sp is 16-byte aligned. Therefore, the caller must supply
a 16-byte aligned pointer, which `stack + UM\_KERN\_PAGE\_SIZE`
already satisfies.
On a side note, musl is unaffected by this issue because it forces
16 byte alignment via `and $-16,%rsi` in its clone wrapper.
Similarly, glibc i386 is also unaffected because it has
`andl $0xfffffff0, %ecx`.
To reproduce this bug, enable CONFIG\_UML\_RTC and
CC\_OPTIMIZE\_FOR\_PERFORMANCE. uml\_rtc will call
add\_sigio\_fd which will then cause write\_sigio\_thread to either go
into segfault loop or panic with "Segfault with no mm".
Similarly, signal stacks will be aligned by the host kernel upon
signal delivery. `- sizeof(void \*)` to sigaltstack is
unconventional and extraneous.
On a related note, initialization of longjmp buffers do require
`- sizeof(void \*)`. This is to account for the return address
that would have been pushed to the stack at the call site.
The reason for uml to respect 16-byte alignment, rather than
telling GCC to assume 8-byte alignment like the host kernel since
commit d9b0cde91c60 ("x86-64, gcc: Use
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3 if supported"), is because uml links
against libc. There is no reason to assume libc is also compiled
with that flag and assumes 8-byte alignment rather than 16-byte.

f2fs: add MODULE\_SOFTDEP to ensure crc32 is included in the initramfs
[ Upstream commit 0dd571785d61528d62cdd8aa49d76bc6085152fe ]
As marcosfrm reported in bugzilla:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=213089
Initramfs generators rely on "pre" softdeps (and "depends") to include
additional required modules.
F2FS does not declare "pre: crc32" softdep. Then every generator (dracut,
mkinitcpio...) has to maintain a hardcoded list for this purpose.
Hence let's use MODULE\_SOFTDEP("pre: crc32") in f2fs code.

x86/signal: Detect and prevent an alternate signal stack overflow
[ Upstream commit 2beb4a53fc3f1081cedc1c1a198c7f56cc4fc60c ]
The kernel pushes context on to the userspace stack to prepare for the
user's signal handler. When the user has supplied an alternate signal
stack, via sigaltstack(2), it is easy for the kernel to verify that the
stack size is sufficient for the current hardware context.
Check if writing the hardware context to the alternate stack will exceed
it's size. If yes, then instead of corrupting user-data and proceeding with
the original signal handler, an immediate SIGSEGV signal is delivered.
Refactor the stack pointer check code from on\_sig\_stack() and use the new
helper.
While the kernel allows new source code to discover and use a sufficient
alternate signal stack size, this check is still necessary to protect
binaries with insufficient alternate signal stack size from data
corruption.

The battery subsystem of the Surface Aggregator Module EC requires us to
register the battery notifier with instance ID 0. However, battery
events are actually sent with the instance ID corresponding to the
device, which is nonzero. Thus, the strict-matching approach doesn't
work here and will discard events that the driver is expected to handle.
To fix this we have to fall back on notifier matching by target-category
only and have to manually check the instance ID in the notifier
callback.

On the IO submission path, blk\_account\_io\_start() may interrupt

of part->stamp may have been updated by other cores, so the time
value collected before the interruption may be less than part->
stamp. So when this happens, we should do nothing to make io\_ticks
more accurate? For kernels less than 5.0, this may cause io\_ticks
to become smaller, which in turn may cause abnormal ioutil values.

ext4: fix WARN\_ON\_ONCE(!buffer\_uptodate) after an error writing the superblock
[ Upstream commit 558d6450c7755aa005d89021204b6cdcae5e848f ]
If a writeback of the superblock fails with an I/O error, the buffer
is marked not uptodate. However, this can cause a WARN\_ON to trigger
when we attempt to write superblock a second time. (Which might
succeed this time, for cerrtain types of block devices such as iSCSI
devices over a flaky network.)
Try to detect this case in flush\_stashed\_error\_work(), and also change
\_\_ext4\_handle\_dirty\_metadata() so we always set the uptodate flag, not
just in the nojournal case.
Before this commit, this problem can be repliciated via:
1. dmsetup create dust1 --table '0 2097152 dust /dev/sdc 0 4096'
2. mount /dev/mapper/dust1 /home/test
3. dmsetup message dust1 0 addbadblock 0 10
4. cd /home/test
5. echo "XXXXXXX" > t
After a few seconds, we got following warning:

PCI: rockchip: Register IRQ handlers after device and data are ready
[ Upstream commit 3cf5f7ab230e2b886e493c7a8449ed50e29d2b98 ]
An IRQ handler may be called at any time after it is registered, so
anything it relies on must be ready before registration.
rockchip\_pcie\_subsys\_irq\_handler() and rockchip\_pcie\_client\_irq\_handler()
read registers in the PCIe controller, but we registered them before
turning on clocks to the controller. If either is called before the clocks
are turned on, the register reads fail and the machine hangs.
Similarly, rockchip\_pcie\_legacy\_int\_handler() uses rockchip->irq\_domain,
but we installed it before initializing irq\_domain.
Register IRQ handlers after their data structures are initialized and
clocks are enabled.
Found by enabling CONFIG\_DEBUG\_SHIRQ, which calls the IRQ handler when it
is being unregistered. An error during the probe path might cause this
unregistration and IRQ handler execution before the device or data
structure init has finished.

power: supply: axp288\_fuel\_gauge: Make "T3 MRD" no\_battery\_list DMI entry more generic
[ Upstream commit 3a06b912a5ce494d7b7300b12719c562be7b566f ]
It turns out that the "T3 MRD" DMI\_BOARD\_NAME value is used in a lot of
different Cherry Trail x5-z8300 / x5-z8350 based Mini-PC / HDMI-stick
models from Ace PC / Meegopad / MinisForum / Wintel (and likely also
other vendors).
Most of the other DMI strings on these boxes unfortunately contain various
generic values like "Default string" or "$(DEFAULT\_STRING)", so we cannot
match on them. These devices do have their chassis-type correctly set to a
value of "3" (desktop) which is a pleasant surprise, so also match on that.
This should avoid the quirk accidentally also getting applied to laptops /
tablets (which do actually have a battery). Although in my quite large
database of Bay and Cherry Trail based devices DMIdecode dumps I don't
have any laptops / tables with a board-name of "T3 MRD", so this should
not be an issue.

The checks for page->mapping are odd, as set\_page\_dirty is an

The warning about the page lock also seems bogus. The comment over
set\_page\_dirty() says that it can be called without the page lock in
some rare cases. I don't think we want to warn if that's the case.

Use \_ASM\_EXTABLE\_FAULT() which stores the trap number and let the exception
fixup return the negated trap number as error.
This allows to separate the fast path and let it handle faults directly and
avoid the slow path for all other exceptions.

fuse: fix illegal access to inode with reused nodeid
[ Upstream commit 15db16837a35d8007cb8563358787412213db25e ]
Server responds to LOOKUP and other ops (READDIRPLUS/CREATE/MKNOD/...)
with ourarg containing nodeid and generation.
If a fuse inode is found in inode cache with the same nodeid but different
generation, the existing fuse inode should be unhashed and marked "bad" and
a new inode with the new generation should be hashed instead.
This can happen, for example, with passhrough fuse filesystem that returns
the real filesystem ino/generation on lookup and where real inode numbers
can get recycled due to real files being unlinked not via the fuse
passthrough filesystem.
With current code, this situation will not be detected and an old fuse
dentry that used to point to an older generation real inode, can be used to
access a completely new inode, which should be accessed only via the new
dentry.
Note that because the FORGET message carries the nodeid w/o generation, the
server should wait to get FORGET counts for the nlookup counts of the old
and reused inodes combined, before it can free the resources associated to
that nodeid.

virtiofs: propagate sync() to file server
[ Upstream commit 2d82ab251ef0f6e7716279b04e9b5a01a86ca530 ]
Even if POSIX doesn't mandate it, linux users legitimately expect sync() to
flush all data and metadata to physical storage when it is located on the
same system. This isn't happening with virtiofs though: sync() inside the
guest returns right away even though data still needs to be flushed from
the host page cache.
This is easily demonstrated by doing the following in the guest:
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/foo bs=1M count=5K ; strace -T -e sync sync
5120+0 records in
5120+0 records out
5368709120 bytes (5.4 GB, 5.0 GiB) copied, 5.22224 s, 1.0 GB/s
sync() = 0 <0.024068>
and start the following in the host when the 'dd' command completes
in the guest:
$ strace -T -e fsync /usr/bin/sync virtiofs/foo
fsync(3) = 0 <10.371640>
There are no good reasons not to honor the expected behavior of sync()
actually: it gives an unrealistic impression that virtiofs is super fast
and that data has safely landed on HW, which isn't the case obviously.
Implement a ->sync\_fs() superblock operation that sends a new FUSE\_SYNCFS
request type for this purpose. Provision a 64-bit placeholder for possible
future extensions. Since the file server cannot handle the wait == 0 case,
we skip it to avoid a gratuitous roundtrip. Note that this is
per-superblock: a FUSE\_SYNCFS is send for the root mount and for each
submount.
Like with FUSE\_FSYNC and FUSE\_FSYNCDIR, lack of support for FUSE\_SYNCFS in
the file server is treated as permanent success. This ensures
compatibility with older file servers: the client will get the current
behavior of sync() not being propagated to the file server.
Note that such an operation allows the file server to DoS sync(). Since a
typical FUSE file server is an untrusted piece of software running in
userspace, this is disabled by default. Only enable it with virtiofs for
now since virtiofsd is supposedly trusted by the guest kernel.

watchdog: iTCO\_wdt: Account for rebooting on second timeout

This was already attempted to fix via 1fccb73011ea: If the BIOS did not
enable TCO SMIs, the timer definitely needs to trigger twice in order to
cause a reboot. If TCO SMIs are on, as well as SMIs in general, we can
continue to assume that the BIOS will perform a reboot on the first
timeout.
QEMU with its ICH9 and related BIOS falls into the former category,
currently taking twice the configured timeout in order to reboot the
machine. For iTCO version that fall under turn\_SMI\_watchdog\_clear\_off,
this is also true and was currently only addressed for v1, irrespective
of the turn\_SMI\_watchdog\_clear\_off value.

PCI: Dynamically map ECAM regions
[ Upstream commit 8fe55ef23387ce3c7488375b1fd539420d7654bb ]
Attempting to boot 32-bit ARM kernels under QEMU's 3.x virt models fails
when we have more than 512M of RAM in the model as we run out of vmalloc
space for the PCI ECAM regions. This failure will be silent when running
libvirt, as the console in that situation is a PCI device.
In this configuration, the kernel maps the whole ECAM, which QEMU sets up
for 256 buses, even when maybe only seven buses are in use. Each bus uses
1M of ECAM space, and ioremap() adds an additional guard page between
allocations. The kernel vmap allocator will align these regions to 512K,
resulting in each mapping eating 1.5M of vmalloc space. This means we need
384M of vmalloc space just to map all of these, which is very wasteful of
resources.
Fix this by only mapping the ECAM for buses we are going to be using. In
my setups, this is around seven buses in most guests, which is 10.5M of
vmalloc space - way smaller than the 384M that would otherwise be required.
This also means that the kernel can boot without forcing extra RAM into
highmem with the vmalloc= argument, or decreasing the virtual RAM available
to the guest.

PCI: pciehp: Ignore Link Down/Up caused by DPC
[ Upstream commit a97396c6eb13f65bea894dbe7739b2e883d40a3e ]
Downstream Port Containment (PCIe r5.0, sec. 6.2.10) disables the link upon
an error and attempts to re-enable it when instructed by the DPC driver.
A slot which is both DPC- and hotplug-capable is currently powered off by
pciehp once DPC is triggered (due to the link change) and powered back up
on successful recovery. That's undesirable, the slot should remain powered
so the hotplugged device remains bound to its driver. DPC notifies the
driver of the error and of successful recovery in pcie\_do\_recovery() and
the driver may then restore the device to working state.
Moreover, Sinan points out that turning off slot power by pciehp may foil
recovery by DPC: Power off/on is a cold reset concurrently to DPC's warm
reset. Sathyanarayanan reports extended delays or failure in link
retraining by DPC if pciehp brings down the slot.
Fix by detecting whether a Link Down event is caused by DPC and awaiting
recovery if so. On successful recovery, ignore both the Link Down and the
subsequent Link Up event.
Afterwards, check whether the link is down to detect surprise-removal or
another DPC event immediately after DPC recovery. Ensure that the
corresponding DLLSC event is not ignored by synthesizing it and invoking
irq\_wake\_thread() to trigger a re-run of pciehp\_ist().
The IRQ threads of the hotplug and DPC drivers, pciehp\_ist() and
dpc\_handler(), race against each other. If pciehp is faster than DPC, it
will wait until DPC recovery completes.
Recovery consists of two steps: The first step (waiting for link
disablement) is recognizable by pciehp through a set DPC Trigger Status
bit. The second step (waiting for link retraining) is recognizable through
a newly introduced PCI\_DPC\_RECOVERING flag.
If DPC is faster than pciehp, neither of the two flags will be set and
pciehp may glean the recovery status from the new PCI\_DPC\_RECOVERED flag.
The flag is zero if DPC didn't occur at all, hence DLLSC events are not
ignored by default.
pciehp waits up to 4 seconds before assuming that DPC recovery failed and
bringing down the slot. This timeout is not taken from the spec (it
doesn't mandate one) but based on a report from Yicong Yang that DPC may
take a bit more than 3 seconds on HiSilicon's Kunpeng platform.
The timeout is necessary because the DPC Trigger Status bit may never
clear: On Root Ports which support RP Extensions for DPC, the DPC driver
polls the DPC RP Busy bit for up to 1 second before giving up on DPC
recovery. Without the timeout, pciehp would then wait indefinitely for DPC
to complete.
This commit draws inspiration from previous attempts to synchronize DPC
with pciehp:

PCI/P2PDMA: Avoid pci\_get\_slot(), which may sleep
[ Upstream commit 3ec0c3ec2d92c09465534a1ff9c6f9d9506ffef6 ]
In order to use upstream\_bridge\_distance\_warn() from a dma\_map function, it
must not sleep. However, pci\_get\_slot() takes the pci\_bus\_sem so it might
sleep.
In order to avoid this, try to get the host bridge's device from the first
element in the device list. It should be impossible for the host bridge's
device to go away while references are held on child devices, so the first
element should not be able to change and, thus, this should be safe.

The Maxim 17047/77693 datasheets describe the interrupt line as active

The interrupt line is shared between PMIC and RTC driver, so using level
sensitive interrupt is here especially important to avoid races. With
an edge configuration in case if first PMIC signals interrupt followed
shortly after by the RTC, the interrupt might not be yet cleared/acked
thus the second one would not be noticed.

PCI: hv: Fix a race condition when removing the device

On removing the device, any work item (hv\_pci\_devices\_present() or
hv\_pci\_eject\_device()) scheduled on workqueue hbus->wq may still be running
and race with hv\_pci\_remove().
This can happen because the host may send PCI\_EJECT or PCI\_BUS\_RELATIONS(2)
and decide to rescind the channel immediately after that.
Fix this by flushing/destroying the workqueue of hbus before doing hbus remove.

power: supply: ab8500: Move to componentized binding
[ Upstream commit 1c1f13a006ed0d71bb5664c8b7e3e77a28da3beb ]
The driver has problems with the different components of
the charging code racing with each other to probe().
This results in all four subdrivers populating battery
information to ascertain that it is populated for their
own needs for example.
Fix this by using component probing and thus expressing
to the kernel that these are dependent components.
The probes can happen in any order and will only acquire
resources such as state container, regulators and
interrupts and initialize the data structures, but no
execution happens until the .bind() callback is called.
The charging driver is the main component and binds
first, then bind in order the three subcomponents:
ab8500-fg, ab8500-btemp and ab8500-chargalg.
Do some housekeeping while we are moving the code around.
Like use devm\_\* for IRQs so as to cut down on some
boilerplate.

kcov: add \_\_no\_sanitize\_coverage to fix noinstr for all architectures
[ Upstream commit 540540d06e9d9b3769b46d88def90f7e7c002322 ]
Until now no compiler supported an attribute to disable coverage
instrumentation as used by KCOV.
To work around this limitation on x86, noinstr functions have their
coverage instrumentation turned into nops by objtool. However, this
solution doesn't scale automatically to other architectures, such as
arm64, which are migrating to use the generic entry code.
Clang [1] and GCC [2] have added support for the attribute recently.
[1] https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/280333021e9550d80f5c1152a34e33e81df1e178
[2] https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commit;h=cec4d4a6782c9bd8d071839c50a239c49caca689
The changes will appear in Clang 13 and GCC 12.
Add \_\_no\_sanitize\_coverage for both compilers, and add it to noinstr.
Note: In the Clang case, \_\_has\_feature(coverage\_sanitizer) is only true if
the feature is enabled, and therefore we do not require an additional
defined(CONFIG\_KCOV) (like in the GCC case where \_\_has\_attribute(..) is
always true) to avoid adding redundant attributes to functions if KCOV is
off. That being said, compilers that support the attribute will not
generate errors/warnings if the attribute is redundantly used; however,
where possible let's avoid it as it reduces preprocessed code size and
associated compile-time overheads.

lib/decompress\_unlz4.c: correctly handle zero-padding around initrds.
[ Upstream commit 2c484419efc09e7234c667aa72698cb79ba8d8ed ]
lz4 compatible decompressor is simple. The format is underspecified and
relies on EOF notification to determine when to stop. Initramfs buffer
format[1] explicitly states that it can have arbitrary number of zero
padding. Thus when operating without a fill function, be extra careful to
ensure that sizes less than 4, or apperantly empty chunksizes are treated
as EOF.
To test this I have created two cpio initrds, first a normal one,
main.cpio. And second one with just a single /test-file with content
"second" second.cpio. Then i compressed both of them with gzip, and with
lz4 -l. Then I created a padding of 4 bytes (dd if=/dev/zero of=pad4 bs=1
count=4). To create four testcase initrds:
1) main.cpio.gzip + extra.cpio.gzip = pad0.gzip
2) main.cpio.lz4 + extra.cpio.lz4 = pad0.lz4
3) main.cpio.gzip + pad4 + extra.cpio.gzip = pad4.gzip
4) main.cpio.lz4 + pad4 + extra.cpio.lz4 = pad4.lz4
The pad4 test-cases replicate the initrd load by grub, as it pads and
aligns every initrd it loads.
All of the above boot, however /test-file was not accessible in the initrd
for the testcase #4, as decoding in lz4 decompressor failed. Also an
error message printed which usually is harmless.
Whith a patched kernel, all of the above testcases now pass, and
/test-file is accessible.
This fixes lz4 initrd decompress warning on every boot with grub. And
more importantly this fixes inability to load multiple lz4 compressed
initrds with grub. This patch has been shipping in Ubuntu kernels since
January 2021.

i2c: core: Disable client irq on reboot/shutdown
[ Upstream commit b64210f2f7c11c757432ba3701d88241b2b98fb1 ]
If an i2c client receives an interrupt during reboot or shutdown it may
be too late to service it by making an i2c transaction on the bus
because the i2c controller has already been shutdown. This can lead to
system hangs if the i2c controller tries to make a transfer that is
doomed to fail because the access to the i2c pins is already shut down,
or an iommu translation has been torn down so i2c controller register
access doesn't work.
Let's simply disable the irq if there isn't a shutdown callback for an
i2c client when there is an irq associated with the device. This will
make sure that irqs don't come in later than the time that we can handle
it. We don't do this if the i2c client device already has a shutdown
callback because presumably they're doing the right thing and quieting
the device so irqs don't come in after the shutdown callback returns.

hda\_tegra\_first\_init() should check the return value (if negative
error number) for errors so as to not pass a negative value to
the devm\_request\_irq().
Fix it by adding a check for the return value irq\_id.

According to  .update\_status() is supposed to
return 0 on success and a negative error code otherwise. Adapt
lm3630a\_bank\_a\_update\_status() and lm3630a\_bank\_b\_update\_status() to

The kernel test robot reports that the "screen\_bits" splash screen data
is missing for the dragen platform:
arch/m68k/68000/dragen2.c:73:16: error: 'screen\_bits' undeclared (first use in this function)
73 | LSSA = (long) screen\_bits;
| ^~~~~~~~~~~
arch/m68k/68000/dragen2.c:73:16: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
Digging around a bit I found the screen\_bits data structure was originally
in a screen.h file that was generated from a screen.xbm file. That was
removed in commit 0c0e6db80683 ("m68k: drop unused parts of 68VZ328
Makefile").
Other splash screen initializers for 68000 targets are kept here as the
C data structures so lets do the same for this one. Add the missing
screen.h file and include it in the dragen specific startup code.

A user of FFADO project reported the issue of ToneWeal FW66. As a result,
the device is identified as one of applications of BeBoB solution.
I note that in the report the device returns contradictory result in plug
discovery process for audio subunit. Fortunately ALSA BeBoB driver doesn't
perform it thus it's likely to handle the device without issues.
I receive no reaction to test request for this patch yet, however it would
be worth to add support for it.

The tprot() inline asm temporarily changes the program check new psw
to redirect a potential program check on the diag instruction.
Restoring of the program check new psw is done in C code behind the
inline asm.
This can be problematic, especially if the function is inlined, since
the compiler can reorder instructions in such a way that a different
instruction, which may result in a program check, might be executed
before the program check new psw has been restored.
To avoid such a scenario move restoring into the inline asm. For
consistency reasons move also saving of the original program check new
psw into the inline asm.

[ Upstream commit 45677c9aebe926192e59475b35a1ff35ff2d4217 ]
The "no\_handler\_test" in ebb selftests attempts to read the PMU
registers twice via helper function "dump\_ebb\_state". First dump is
just before closing of event and the second invocation is done after
closing of the event. The original intention of second
dump\_ebb\_state was to dump the state of registers at the end of
the test when the counters are frozen. But this will be achieved
with the first call itself since sample period is set to low value
and PMU will be frozen by then. Hence patch removes the
dump which was done before closing of the event.

scsi: storvsc: Correctly handle multiple flags in srb\_status
[ Upstream commit 52e1b3b3daa9d53f0204bf474ee1d4b1beb38234 ]
Hyper-V is observed to sometimes set multiple flags in the srb\_status, such
as ABORTED and ERROR. Current code in storvsc\_handle\_error() handles only a
single flag being set, and does nothing when multiple flags are set. Fix
this by changing the case statement into a series of "if" statements
testing individual flags. The functionality for handling each flag is
unchanged.

arm\_smmu\_rpm\_get() invokes pm\_runtime\_get\_sync(), which increases the

The reference counting issue happens in some error handling paths of

Remove the hack to assign the global console\_port variable at probe time.
This assumption that cons->index is -1 is wrong for systems that specify
'console=' in the cmdline (or 'stdout-path' in dts). Hence, on such system
the actual console assignment is ignored, and the first UART that happens
to be probed is used as console instead.
Move the logic to console\_setup() and map the console to the correct port
through the array of available ports instead.

the wrong cmd.
Wait to release the task\_id until the last put has been done on the
iscsi\_task. Because libiscsi grabs a ref to the task when sending the
abort, we know that for the non-abort timeout case that the task\_id we are
referencing is for the cmd that was supposed to be aborted.
A latter commit will fix the case where the abort times out while we are
running qedi\_tmf\_work.

[ Upstream commit bdd4aad7ff92ae39c2e93c415bb6761cb8b584da ]
The iscsi offload drivers are setting the shost->max\_id to the max number
of sessions they support. The problem is that max\_id is not the max number
of targets but the highest identifier the targets can have. To use it to
limit the number of targets we need to set it to max sessions - 1, or we
can end up with a session we might not have preallocated resources for.

If we haven't done a unbind target call we can race where
iscsi\_conn\_teardown wakes up the EH thread and then frees the conn while
those threads are still accessing the conn ehwait.
We can only do one TMF per session so this just moves the TMF fields from
the conn to the session. We can then rely on the
iscsi\_session\_teardown->iscsi\_remove\_session->\_\_iscsi\_unbind\_session call
to remove the target and it's devices, and know after that point there is
no device or scsi-ml callout trying to access the session.

[ Upstream commit 9bedd36e9146b34dda4d6994e3aa1d72bc6442c1 ]
While reenabling the IRQ after IRQ poll there may be a small window for the
firmware to post the replies with interrupts raised. In that case the
driver will not see the interrupts which leads to I/O timeout.
This issue only happens when there are many I/O completions on a single
reply queue. This forces the driver to switch between the interrupt and IRQ
context.
Make the driver process the reply queue one more time after enabling the
IRQ.

scsi: megaraid\_sas: Early detection of VD deletion through RaidMap update
[ Upstream commit ae6874ba4b43c5a00065f48599811a09d33b873d ]
Consider the case where a VD is deleted and the targetID of that VD is
assigned to a newly created VD. If the sequence of deletion/addition of VD
happens very quickly there is a possibility that second event (VD add)
occurs even before the driver processes the first event (VD delete). As
event processing is done in deferred context the device list remains the
same (but targetID is re-used) so driver will not learn the VD
deletion/additon. I/Os meant for the older VD will be directed to new VD
which may lead to data corruption.
Make driver detect the deleted VD as soon as possible based on the RaidMap
update and block further I/O to that device.

no gain in returning the SCSI status, as everything the callers do is to
check against scsi\_result\_is\_good(), which is what scsi\_mode\_sense() does
already. So change the calling convention to return a standard error code
on failure, and 0 on success, and adapt the description and all callers.

scsi: core: Cap scsi\_host cmd\_per\_lun at can\_queue
[ Upstream commit ea2f0f77538c50739b9fb4de4700cee5535e1f77 ]
The sysfs handling function sdev\_store\_queue\_depth() enforces that the sdev
queue depth cannot exceed shost can\_queue. The initial sdev queue depth
comes from shost cmd\_per\_lun. However, the LLDD may manually set
cmd\_per\_lun to be larger than can\_queue, which leads to an initial sdev
queue depth greater than can\_queue.
Such an issue was reported in [0], which caused a hang. That has since been
fixed in commit fc09acb7de31 ("scsi: scsi\_debug: Fix cmd\_per\_lun, set to
max\_queue").
Stop this possibly happening for other drivers by capping shost cmd\_per\_lun
at shost can\_queue.

scsi: lpfc: Fix "Unexpected timeout" error in direct attach topology
[ Upstream commit e30d55137edef47434c40d7570276a0846fe922c ]
An 'unexpected timeout' message may be seen in a point-2-point topology.
The message occurs when a PLOGI is received before the driver is notified
of FLOGI completion. The FLOGI completion failure causes discovery to be
triggered for a second time. The discovery timer is restarted but no new
discovery activity is initiated, thus the timeout message eventually
appears.
In point-2-point, when discovery has progressed before the FLOGI completion
is processed, it is not a failure. Add code to FLOGI completion to detect
that discovery has progressed and exit the FLOGI handling (noop'ing it).

has no affect a the runtime pm core protects against going negative.
Whilst here use pm\_runtime\_resume\_and\_get() to tidy things up a little.

[ Upstream commit 41120ebbb1eb5e9dec93320e259d5b2c93226073 ]
In both the probe() error path and remove() pm\_runtime\_put\_noidle()
is called which will decrement the runtime pm reference count.
However, there is no matching function to have raised the reference count.
Not this isn't a fix as the runtime pm core will stop the reference count
going negative anyway.
An alternative would have been to raise the count in these paths, but
it is not clear why that would be necessary.
Whilst we are here replace some boilerplate with pm\_runtime\_resume\_and\_get()

misc: alcor\_pci: fix null-ptr-deref when there is no PCI bridge
[ Upstream commit 3ce3e45cc333da707d4d6eb433574b990bcc26f5 ]
There is an issue with the ASPM(optional) capability checking function.
A device might be attached to root complex directly, in this case,
bus->self(bridge) will be NULL, thus priv->parent\_pdev is NULL.
Since alcor\_pci\_init\_check\_aspm(priv->parent\_pdev) checks the PCI link's
ASPM capability and populate parent\_cap\_off, which will be used later by
alcor\_pci\_aspm\_ctrl() to dynamically turn on/off device, what we can do
here is to avoid checking the capability if we are on the root complex.
This will make pdev\_cap\_off 0 and alcor\_pci\_aspm\_ctrl() will simply
return when bring called, effectively disable ASPM for the device.

In the err\_free\_devices error branch of ibmasm\_init\_one,
mouse\_dev and keybd\_dev are freed by input\_free\_device(), and return
error. Then the execution runs into error\_send\_message error branch
of ibmasm\_init\_one, where ibmasm\_free\_remote\_input\_dev(sp) is called

serial: 8250: of: Check for CONFIG\_SERIAL\_8250\_BCM7271
[ Upstream commit f5b08386dee439c7a9e60ce0a4a4a705f3a60dff ]
Our SoC's have always had a NS16650A UART core and older SoC's would
have a compatible string of: 'compatible = ""ns16550a"' and use the
8250\_of driver. Our newer SoC's have added enhancements to the base
core to add support for DMA and accurate high speed baud rates and use
this newer 8250\_bcm7271 driver. The Device Tree node for our enhanced
UARTs has a compatible string of: 'compatible = "brcm,bcm7271-uart",
"ns16550a"''. With both drivers running and the link order setup so
that the 8250\_bcm7217 driver is initialized before the 8250\_of driver,
we should bind the 8250\_bcm7271 driver to the enhanced UART, or for
upstream kernels that don't have the 8250\_bcm7271 driver, we bind to
the 8250\_of driver.
The problem is that when both the 8250\_of and 8250\_bcm7271 drivers
were running, occasionally the 8250\_of driver would be bound to the
enhanced UART instead of the 8250\_bcm7271 driver. This was happening
because we use SCMI based clocks which come up late in initialization
and cause probe DEFER's when the two drivers get their clocks.
Occasionally the SCMI clock would become ready between the 8250\_bcm7271
probe and the 8250\_of probe and the 8250\_of driver would be bound. To
fix this we decided to config only our 8250\_bcm7271 driver and added
"ns16665a0" to the compatible string so the driver would work on our
older system.
This commit has of\_platform\_serial\_probe() check specifically for the
"brcm,bcm7271-uart" and whether its companion driver is enabled. If it
is the case, and the clock provider is not ready, we want to make sure
that when the 8250\_bcm7271.c driver returns EPROBE\_DEFER, we are not
getting the UART registered via 8250\_of.c.

this is not completely correct, there is a bit in the data register

pointless in the first place.

soundwire: bus: handle -ENODATA errors in clock stop/start sequences
[ Upstream commit b50bb8ba369cdc8814e82558117711c12ef3af3d ]
If a device lost sync and can no longer ACK a command, it may not be
able to enter a lower-power state but it will still be able to resync
when the clock restarts. In those cases, we want to continue with the
clock stop sequence.
This patch modifies the behavior during clock stop sequences to only
log errors unrelated to -ENODATA/Command\_Ignored. The flow is also
modified so that loops continue to prepare/deprepare other devices
even when one seems to have lost sync.
When resuming the clocks, all issues are logged with a dev\_warn(),
previously only some of them were checked. This is the only part that
now differs between the clock stop entry and clock stop exit
sequences: while we don't want to stop the suspend flow, we do want
information on potential issues while resuming, as they may have
ripple effects.
For consistency the log messages are also modified to be unique and
self-explanatory. Errors in sdw\_slave\_clk\_stop\_callback() were
removed, they are now handled in the caller.

soundwire: bus: only use CLOCK\_STOP\_MODE0 and fix confusions
[ Upstream commit 345e9f5ca798600e44c0843646621f2804eb99f4 ]
Existing devices and implementations only support the required
CLOCK\_STOP\_MODE0. All the code related to CLOCK\_STOP\_MODE1 has not
been tested and is highly questionable, with a clear confusion between
CLOCK\_STOP\_MODE1 and the simple clock stop state machine.
This patch removes all usages of CLOCK\_STOP\_MODE1 - which has no
impact on any solution - and fixes the use of the simple clock stop
state machine. The resulting code should be a lot more symmetrical and
easier to maintain.
Note that CLOCK\_STOP\_MODE1 is not supported in the SoundWire Device
Class specification so it's rather unlikely that we need to re-add
this mode later.

rcu: Reject RCU\_LOCKDEP\_WARN() false positives
[ Upstream commit 3066820034b5dd4e89bd74a7739c51c2d6f5e554 ]
If another lockdep report runs concurrently with an RCU lockdep report
from RCU\_LOCKDEP\_WARN(), the following sequence of events can occur:
1. debug\_lockdep\_rcu\_enabled() sees that lockdep is enabled
when called from (say) synchronize\_rcu().
2. Lockdep is disabled by a concurrent lockdep report.
3. debug\_lockdep\_rcu\_enabled() evaluates its lockdep-expression
argument, for example, lock\_is\_held(&rcu\_bh\_lock\_map).
4. Because lockdep is now disabled, lock\_is\_held() plays it safe and
returns the constant 1.
5. But in this case, the constant 1 is not safe, because invoking
synchronize\_rcu() under rcu\_read\_lock\_bh() is disallowed.
6. debug\_lockdep\_rcu\_enabled() wrongly invokes lockdep\_rcu\_suspicious(),
resulting in a false-positive splat.
This commit therefore changes RCU\_LOCKDEP\_WARN() to check
debug\_lockdep\_rcu\_enabled() after checking the lockdep expression,
so that any "safe" returns from lock\_is\_held() are rejected by
debug\_lockdep\_rcu\_enabled(). This requires memory ordering, which is
supplied by READ\_ONCE(debug\_locks). The resulting volatile accesses
prevent the compiler from reordering and the fact that only one variable
is being accessed prevents the underlying hardware from reordering.
The combination works for IA64, which can reorder reads to the same
location, but this is defeated by the volatile accesses, which compile
to load instructions that provide ordering.

srcu: Fix broken node geometry after early ssp init
[ Upstream commit b5befe842e6612cf894cf4a199924ee872d8b7d8 ]
An srcu\_struct structure that is initialized before rcu\_init\_geometry()
will have its srcu\_node hierarchy based on CONFIG\_NR\_CPUS. Once
rcu\_init\_geometry() is called, this hierarchy is compressed as needed
for the actual maximum number of CPUs for this system.
Later on, that srcu\_struct structure is confused, sometimes referring
to its initial CONFIG\_NR\_CPUS-based hierarchy, and sometimes instead
to the new num\_possible\_cpus() hierarchy. For example, each of its
->mynode fields continues to reference the original leaf rcu\_node
structures, some of which might no longer exist. On the other hand,
srcu\_for\_each\_node\_breadth\_first() traverses to the new node hierarchy.
There are at least two bad possible outcomes to this:
1) a) A callback enqueued early on an srcu\_data structure (call it
\*sdp) is recorded pending on sdp->mynode->srcu\_data\_have\_cbs in
srcu\_funnel\_gp\_start() with sdp->mynode pointing to a deep leaf
(say 3 levels).
b) The grace period ends after rcu\_init\_geometry() shrinks the
nodes level to a single one. srcu\_gp\_end() walks through the new
srcu\_node hierarchy without ever reaching the old leaves so the
callback is never executed.
This is easily reproduced on an 8 CPUs machine with CONFIG\_NR\_CPUS >= 32
and "rcupdate.rcu\_self\_test=1". The srcu\_barrier() after early tests
verification never completes and the boot hangs:

2) An srcu\_struct structure that is initialized before rcu\_init\_geometry()
and used afterward will always have stale rdp->mynode references,
resulting in callbacks to be missed in srcu\_gp\_end(), just like in
the previous scenario.
This commit therefore causes init\_srcu\_struct\_nodes to initialize the
geometry, if needed. This ensures that the srcu\_node hierarchy is
properly built and distributed from the get-go.

drm/dp\_mst: Avoid to mess up payload table by ports in stale topology
commit 3769e4c0af5b82c8ea21d037013cb9564dfaa51f upstream.
[Why]
After unplug/hotplug hub from the system, userspace might start to
clear stale payloads gradually. If we call drm\_dp\_mst\_deallocate\_vcpi()
to release stale VCPI of those ports which are not relating to current
topology, we have chane to wrongly clear active payload table entry for
current topology.
E.g.
We have allocated VCPI 1 in current payload table and we call
drm\_dp\_mst\_deallocate\_vcpi() to clean VCPI 1 in stale topology. In
drm\_dp\_mst\_deallocate\_vcpi(), it will call drm\_dp\_mst\_put\_payload\_id()
tp put VCPI 1 and which means ID 1 is available again. Thereafter, if we
want to allocate a new payload stream, it will find ID 1 is available by
drm\_dp\_mst\_assign\_payload\_id(). However, ID 1 is being used
[How]
Check target sink is relating to current topology or not before doing
any payload table update.
Searching upward to find the target sink's relevant root branch device.
If the found root branch device is not the same root of current
topology, don't update payload table.

drm/dp\_mst: Do not set proposed vcpi directly
commit 35d3e8cb35e75450f87f87e3d314e2d418b6954b upstream.
[Why]
When we receive CSN message to notify one port is disconnected, we will
implicitly set its corresponding num\_slots to 0. Later on, we will
eventually call drm\_dp\_update\_payload\_part1() to arrange down streams.
In drm\_dp\_update\_payload\_part1(), we iterate over all proposed\_vcpis[]
to do the update. Not specific to a target sink only. For example, if we
light up 2 monitors, Monitor\_A and Monitor\_B, and then we unplug
Monitor\_B. Later on, when we call drm\_dp\_update\_payload\_part1() to try
to update payload for Monitor\_A, we'll also implicitly clean payload for
Monitor\_B at the same time. And finally, when we try to call
drm\_dp\_update\_payload\_part1() to clean payload for Monitor\_B, we will do
nothing at this time since payload for Monitor\_B has been cleaned up
previously.
For StarTech 1to3 DP hub, it seems like if we didn't update DPCD payload
ID table then polling for "ACT Handled"(BIT\_1 of DPCD 002C0h) will fail
and this polling will last for 3 seconds.
Therefore, guess the best way is we don't set the proposed\_vcpi[]
diretly. Let user of these herlper functions to set the proposed\_vcpi
directly.
[How]
1. Revert commit 7617e9621bf2 ("drm/dp\_mst: clear time slots for ports
invalid")
2. Tackle the issue in previous commit by skipping those trasient
proposed VCPIs. These stale VCPIs shoulde be explicitly cleared by
user later on.

2) We have locked fs\_info->tree\_root->log\_mutex, but we end up not

So fix this by unlocking fs\_info->tree\_root->log\_mutex instead of

btrfs: rework chunk allocation to avoid exhaustion of the system chunk array
commit 79bd37120b149532af5b21953643ed74af69654f upstream.
Commit eafa4fd0ad0607 ("btrfs: fix exhaustion of the system chunk array
due to concurrent allocations") fixed a problem that resulted in
exhausting the system chunk array in the superblock when there are many
tasks allocating chunks in parallel. Basically too many tasks enter the
first phase of chunk allocation without previous tasks having finished
their second phase of allocation, resulting in too many system chunks
being allocated. That was originally observed when running the fallocate
tests of stress-ng on a PowerPC machine, using a node size of 64K.
However that commit also introduced a deadlock where a task in phase 1 of
the chunk allocation waited for another task that had allocated a system
chunk to finish its phase 2, but that other task was waiting on an extent
buffer lock held by the first task, therefore resulting in both tasks not
making any progress. That change was later reverted by a patch with the
subject "btrfs: fix deadlock with concurrent chunk allocations involving
system chunks", since there is no simple and short solution to address it
and the deadlock is relatively easy to trigger on zoned filesystems, while
the system chunk array exhaustion is not so common.
This change reworks the chunk allocation to avoid the system chunk array
exhaustion. It accomplishes that by making the first phase of chunk
allocation do the updates of the device items in the chunk btree and the
insertion of the new chunk item in the chunk btree. This is done while
under the protection of the chunk mutex (fs\_info->chunk\_mutex), in the
same critical section that checks for available system space, allocates
a new system chunk if needed and reserves system chunk space. This way
we do not have chunk space reserved until the second phase completes.
The same logic is applied to chunk removal as well, since it keeps
reserved system space long after it is done updating the chunk btree.
For direct allocation of system chunks, the previous behaviour remains,
because otherwise we would deadlock on extent buffers of the chunk btree.
Changes to the chunk btree are by large done by chunk allocation and chunk
removal, which first reserve chunk system space and then later do changes
to the chunk btree. The other remaining cases are uncommon and correspond
to adding a device, removing a device and resizing a device. All these
other cases do not pre-reserve system space, they modify the chunk btree
right away, so they don't hold reserved space for a long period like chunk
allocation and chunk removal do.
The diff of this change is huge, but more than half of it is just addition
of comments describing both how things work regarding chunk allocation and
removal, including both the new behavior and the parts of the old behavior
that did not change.

btrfs: fix deadlock with concurrent chunk allocations involving system chunks
commit 1cb3db1cf383a3c7dbda1aa0ce748b0958759947 upstream.
When a task attempting to allocate a new chunk verifies that there is not
currently enough free space in the system space\_info and there is another
task that allocated a new system chunk but it did not finish yet the
creation of the respective block group, it waits for that other task to
finish creating the block group. This is to avoid exhaustion of the system
chunk array in the superblock, which is limited, when we have a thundering
herd of tasks allocating new chunks. This problem was described and fixed
by commit eafa4fd0ad0607 ("btrfs: fix exhaustion of the system chunk array
due to concurrent allocations").
However there are two very similar scenarios where this can lead to a
deadlock:
1) Task B allocated a new system chunk and task A is waiting on task B
to finish creation of the respective system block group. However before
task B ends its transaction handle and finishes the creation of the
system block group, it attempts to allocate another chunk (like a data
chunk for an fallocate operation for a very large range). Task B will
be unable to progress and allocate the new chunk, because task A set
space\_info->chunk\_alloc to 1 and therefore it loops at
btrfs\_chunk\_alloc() waiting for task A to finish its chunk allocation
and set space\_info->chunk\_alloc to 0, but task A is waiting on task B
to finish creation of the new system block group, therefore resulting
in a deadlock;
2) Task B allocated a new system chunk and task A is waiting on task B to
finish creation of the respective system block group. By the time that
task B enter the final phase of block group allocation, which happens
at btrfs\_create\_pending\_block\_groups(), when it modifies the extent
tree, the device tree or the chunk tree to insert the items for some
new block group, it needs to allocate a new chunk, so it ends up at
btrfs\_chunk\_alloc() and keeps looping there because task A has set
space\_info->chunk\_alloc to 1, but task A is waiting for task B to
finish creation of the new system block group and release the reserved
system space, therefore resulting in a deadlock.
In short, the problem is if a task B needs to allocate a new chunk after
it previously allocated a new system chunk and if another task A is
currently waiting for task B to complete the allocation of the new system
chunk.
Unfortunately this deadlock scenario introduced by the previous fix for
the system chunk array exhaustion problem does not have a simple and short
fix, and requires a big change to rework the chunk allocation code so that
chunk btree updates are all made in the first phase of chunk allocation.
And since this deadlock regression is being frequently hit on zoned
filesystems and the system chunk array exhaustion problem is triggered
in more extreme cases (originally observed on PowerPC with a node size
of 64K when running the fallocate tests from stress-ng), revert the
changes from that commit. The next patch in the series, with a subject
of "btrfs: rework chunk allocation to avoid exhaustion of the system
chunk array" does the necessary changes to fix the system chunk array
exhaustion problem.

btrfs: properly split extent\_map for REQ\_OP\_ZONE\_APPEND
commit abb99cfdaf0759f8a619e5fecf52ccccdf310c8c upstream.
Damien reported a test failure with btrfs/209. The test itself ran fine,
but the fsck ran afterwards reported a corrupted filesystem.
The filesystem corruption happens because we're splitting an extent and
then writing the extent twice. We have to split the extent though, because
we're creating too large extents for a REQ\_OP\_ZONE\_APPEND operation.
When dumping the extent tree, we can see two EXTENT\_ITEMs at the same
start address but different lengths.
$ btrfs inspect dump-tree /dev/nullb1 -t extent
...
item 19 key (269484032 EXTENT\_ITEM 126976) itemoff 15470 itemsize 53
refs 1 gen 7 flags DATA
extent data backref root FS\_TREE objectid 257 offset 786432 count 1
item 20 key (269484032 EXTENT\_ITEM 262144) itemoff 15417 itemsize 53
refs 1 gen 7 flags DATA
extent data backref root FS\_TREE objectid 257 offset 786432 count 1
The duplicated EXTENT\_ITEMs originally come from wrongly split extent\_map in
extract\_ordered\_extent(). Since extract\_ordered\_extent() uses
create\_io\_em() to split an existing extent\_map, we will have
split->orig\_start != split->start. Then, it will be logged with non-zero
"extent data offset". Finally, the logged entries are replayed into
a duplicated EXTENT\_ITEM.
Introduce and use proper splitting function for extent\_map. The function is
intended to be simple and specific usage for extract\_ordered\_extent() e.g.
not supporting compression case (we do not allow splitting compressed
extent\_map anyway).
There was a question raised by Qu, in summary why we want to split the
extent map (and not the bio):
The problem is not the limit on the zone end, which as you mention is
the same as the block group end. The problem is that data write use zone
append (ZA) operations. ZA BIOs cannot be split so a large extent may
need to be processed with multiple ZA BIOs, While that is also true for
regular writes, the major difference is that ZA are "nameless" write
operation giving back the written sectors on completion. And ZA
operations may be reordered by the block layer (not intentionally
though). Combine both of these characteristics and you can see that the
data for a large extent may end up being shuffled when written resulting
in data corruption and the impossibility to map the extent to some start
sector.
To avoid this problem, zoned btrfs uses the principle "one data extent
== one ZA BIO". So large extents need to be split. This is unfortunate,
but we can revisit this later and optimize, e.g. merge back together the
fragments of an extent once written if they actually were written
sequentially in the zone.

arm64: Avoid premature usercopy failure
commit 295cf156231ca3f9e3a66bde7fab5e09c41835e0 upstream.
Al reminds us that the usercopy API must only return complete failure
if absolutely nothing could be copied. Currently, if userspace does
something silly like giving us an unaligned pointer to Device memory,
or a size which overruns MTE tag bounds, we may fail to honour that
requirement when faulting on a multi-byte access even though a smaller
access could have succeeded.
Add a mitigation to the fixup routines to fall back to a single-byte
copy if we faulted on a larger access before anything has been written
to the destination, to guarantee making \*some\* forward progress. We
needn't be too concerned about the overall performance since this should
only occur when callers are doing something a bit dodgy in the first
place. Particularly broken userspace might still be able to trick
generic\_perform\_write() into an infinite loop by targeting write() at
an mmap() of some read-only device register where the fault-in load
succeeds but any store synchronously aborts such that copy\_to\_user() is
genuinely unable to make progress, but, well, don't do that...

cgroup: verify that source is a string
commit 3b0462726e7ef281c35a7a4ae33e93ee2bc9975b upstream.
The following sequence can be used to trigger a UAF:
int fscontext\_fd = fsopen("cgroup");
int fd\_null = open("/dev/null, O\_RDONLY);
int fsconfig(fscontext\_fd, FSCONFIG\_SET\_FD, "source", fd\_null);
close\_range(3, ~0U, 0);
The cgroup v1 specific fs parser expects a string for the "source"
parameter. However, it is perfectly legitimate to e.g. specify a file
descriptor for the "source" parameter. The fs parser doesn't know what
a filesystem allows there. So it's a bug to assume that "source" is
always of type fs\_value\_is\_string when it can reasonably also be
fs\_value\_is\_file.
This assumption in the cgroup code causes a UAF because struct
fs\_parameter uses a union for the actual value. Access to that union is
guarded by the param->type member. Since the cgroup paramter parser
didn't check param->type but unconditionally moved param->string into
fc->source a close on the fscontext\_fd would trigger a UAF during
put\_fs\_context() which frees fc->source thereby freeing the file stashed
in param->file causing a UAF during a close of the fd\_null.
Fix this by verifying that param->type is actually a string and report
an error if not.
In follow up patches I'll add a new generic helper that can be used here
and by other filesystems instead of this error-prone copy-pasta fix.
But fixing it in here first makes backporting a it to stable a lot
easier.

drm/i915/gt: Fix -EDEADLK handling regression
commit 2feeb52859fc1ab94cd35b61ada3a6ac4ff24243 upstream.
The conversion to ww mutexes failed to address the fence code which
already returns -EDEADLK when we run out of fences. Ww mutexes on
the other hand treat -EDEADLK as an internal errno value indicating
a need to restart the operation due to a deadlock. So now when the
fence code returns -EDEADLK the higher level code erroneously
restarts everything instead of returning the error to userspace
as is expected.
To remedy this let's switch the fence code to use a different errno
value for this. -ENOBUFS seems like a semi-reasonable unique choice.
Apart from igt the only user of this I could find is sna, and even
there all we do is dump the current fence registers from debugfs
into the X server log. So no user visible functionality is affected.
If we really cared about preserving this we could of course convert
back to -EDEADLK higher up, but doesn't seem like that's worth
the hassle here.
Not quite sure which commit specifically broke this, but I'll
just attribute it to the general gem ww mutex work.

drm/i915/gtt: drop the page table optimisation
commit 0abb33bfca0fb74df76aac03e90ce685016ef7be upstream.
We skip filling out the pt with scratch entries if the va range covers
the entire pt, since we later have to fill it with the PTEs for the
object pages anyway. However this might leave open a small window where
the PTEs don't point to anything valid for the HW to consume.
When for example using 2M GTT pages this fill\_px() showed up as being
quite significant in perf measurements, and ends up being completely
wasted since we ignore the pt and just use the pde directly.
Anyway, currently we have our PTE construction split between alloc and
insert, which is probably slightly iffy nowadays, since the alloc
doesn't actually allocate anything anymore, instead it just sets up the
page directories and points the PTEs at the scratch page. Later when we
do the insert step we re-program the PTEs again. Better might be to
squash the alloc and insert into a single step, then bringing back this
optimisation(along with some others) should be possible.

tracing: Do not reference char \* as a string in histograms

Where it triggered a fault on strlen(key) where key was the filename.
The reason is that filename is a char \* to user space, and the histogram
code just blindly dereferenced it, with obvious bad results.
I originally tried to use strncpy\_from\_user/kernel\_nofault() but found
that there's other places that its dereferenced and not worth the effort.
Just do not allow "char \*" to act like strings.

This fixes a bug in context cache clear operation. The code was not
following the correct invalidation flow. A global device TLB invalidation
should be added after the IOTLB invalidation. At the same time, it
uses the domain ID from the context entry. But in scalable mode, the
domain ID is in PASID table entry, not context entry.

scsi: core: Fix bad pointer dereference when ehandler kthread is invalid
commit 93aa71ad7379900e61c8adff6a710a4c18c7c99b upstream.
Commit 66a834d09293 ("scsi: core: Fix error handling of scsi\_host\_alloc()")
changed the allocation logic to call put\_device() to perform host cleanup
with the assumption that IDA removal and stopping the kthread would
properly be performed in scsi\_host\_dev\_release(). However, in the unlikely
case that the error handler thread fails to spawn, shost->ehandler is set
to ERR\_PTR(-ENOMEM).
The error handler cleanup code in scsi\_host\_dev\_release() will call
kthread\_stop() if shost->ehandler != NULL which will always be the case
whether the kthread was successfully spawned or not. In the case that it
failed to spawn this has the nasty side effect of trying to dereference an
invalid pointer when kthread\_stop() is called. The following splat provides
an example of this behavior in the wild:
scsi host11: error handler thread failed to spawn, error = -4

KVM: SVM: remove INIT intercept handler
commit 896707c212d440a6863ce0a3930c8a609e24497d upstream.
Kernel never sends real INIT even to CPUs, other than on boot.
Thus INIT interception is an error which should be caught
by a check for an unknown VMexit reason.
On top of that, the current INIT VM exit handler skips
the current instruction which is wrong.
That was added in commit 5ff3a351f687 ("KVM: x86: Move trivial
instruction-based exit handlers to common code").

Commit 5ff3a351f687 ("KVM: x86: Move trivial instruction-based

treating nop\_on\_interception and nop\_interception in the same way.
Former does truly nothing while the latter skips the instruction.

KVM: X86: Disable hardware breakpoints unconditionally before kvm\_x86->run()
commit f85d40160691881a17a397c448d799dfc90987ba upstream.
When the host is using debug registers but the guest is not using them
nor is the guest in guest-debug state, the kvm code does not reset
the host debug registers before kvm\_x86->run(). Rather, it relies on
the hardware vmentry instruction to automatically reset the dr7 registers
which ensures that the host breakpoints do not affect the guest.
This however violates the non-instrumentable nature around VM entry
and exit; for example, when a host breakpoint is set on vcpu->arch.cr2,
Another issue is consistency. When the guest debug registers are active,
the host breakpoints are reset before kvm\_x86->run(). But when the
guest debug registers are inactive, the host breakpoints are delayed to
be disabled. The host tracing tools may see different results depending
on what the guest is doing.
To fix the problems, we clear %db7 unconditionally before kvm\_x86->run()
if the host has set any breakpoints, no matter if the guest is using
them or not.

KVM: SVM: Revert clearing of C-bit on GPA in #NPF handler
commit 76ff371b67cb12fb635396234468abcf6a466f16 upstream.
Don't clear the C-bit in the #NPF handler, as it is a legal GPA bit for
non-SEV guests, and for SEV guests the C-bit is dropped before the GPA
hits the NPT in hardware. Clearing the bit for non-SEV guests causes KVM
to mishandle #NPFs with that collide with the host's C-bit.
Although the APM doesn't explicitly state that the C-bit is not reserved
for non-SEV, Tom Lendacky confirmed that the following snippet about the
effective reduction due to the C-bit does indeed apply only to SEV guests.
Note that because guest physical addresses are always translated
through the nested page tables, the size of the guest physical address
space is not impacted by any physical address space reduction indicated
in CPUID 8000\_001F[EBX]. If the C-bit is a physical address bit however,
the guest physical address space is effectively reduced by 1 bit.
And for SEV guests, the APM clearly states that the bit is dropped before
walking the nested page tables.
If the C-bit is an address bit, this bit is masked from the guest
physical address when it is translated through the nested page tables.
Consequently, the hypervisor does not need to be aware of which pages
the guest has chosen to mark private.
Note, the bogus C-bit clearing was removed from legacy #PF handler in
commit 6d1b867d0456 ("KVM: SVM: Don't strip the C-bit from CR2 on #PF
interception").

KVM: x86/mmu: Do not apply HPA (memory encryption) mask to GPAs
commit fc9bf2e087efcd81bda2e52d09616d2a1bf982a8 upstream.
Ignore "dynamic" host adjustments to the physical address mask when
generating the masks for guest PTEs, i.e. the guest PA masks. The host
physical address space and guest physical address space are two different
beasts, e.g. even though SEV's C-bit is the same bit location for both
host and guest, disabling SME in the host (which clears shadow\_me\_mask)
does not affect the guest PTE->GPA "translation".
For non-SEV guests, not dropping bits is the correct behavior. Assuming
KVM and userspace correctly enumerate/configure guest MAXPHYADDR, bits
that are lost as collateral damage from memory encryption are treated as
reserved bits, i.e. KVM will never get to the point where it attempts to
generate a gfn using the affected bits. And if userspace wants to create
a bogus vCPU, then userspace gets to deal with the fallout of hardware
doing odd things with bad GPAs.
For SEV guests, not dropping the C-bit is technically wrong, but it's a
moot point because KVM can't read SEV guest's page tables in any case
since they're always encrypted. Not to mention that the current KVM code
is also broken since sme\_me\_mask does not have to be non-zero for SEV to
be supported by KVM. The proper fix would be to teach all of KVM to
correctly handle guest private memory, but that's a task for the future.

KVM: x86: Use kernel's x86\_phys\_bits to handle reduced MAXPHYADDR
commit e39f00f60ebd2e7b295c37a05e6349df656d3eb8 upstream.
Use boot\_cpu\_data.x86\_phys\_bits instead of the raw CPUID information to
enumerate the MAXPHYADDR for KVM guests when TDP is disabled (the guest
version is only relevant to NPT/TDP).
When using shadow paging, any reductions to the host's MAXPHYADDR apply
to KVM and its guests as well, i.e. using the raw CPUID info will cause
KVM to misreport the number of PA bits available to the guest.
Unconditionally zero out the "Physical Address bit reduction" entry.
For !TDP, the adjustment is already done, and for TDP enumerating the
host's reduction is wrong as the reduction does not apply to GPAs.

However, server IP address may change, even when the old one continues

We should schedule the next DNS resolution based on the TTL of

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 497 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2832416.1).

**Please note that on December 10, 2021, Oracle released a Security Alert for Apache Log4j vulnerabilities [CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html). Customers should review the Alert if they have not already done so.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

CVE ID         : CVE-2020-36311 CVE-2021-3609 CVE-2021-33909 CVE-2021-34693
Debian Bug     : 990072

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

This update is not yet available for the armhf (ARM EABI hard-float)
architecture.

CVE-2020-36311

    A flaw was discovered in the KVM subsystem for AMD CPUs, allowing an
    attacker to cause a denial of service by triggering destruction of a
    large SEV VM.

CVE-2021-3609

    Norbert Slusarek reported a race condition vulnerability in the CAN
    BCM networking protocol, allowing a local attacker to escalate
    privileges.

CVE-2021-33909

    The Qualys Research Labs discovered a size_t-to-int conversion
    vulnerability in the Linux kernel's filesystem layer. An
    unprivileged local attacker able to create, mount, and then delete a
    deep directory structure whose total path length exceeds 1GB, can
    take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation.

    Details can be found in the Qualys advisory at
    <https://www.qualys.com/2021/07/20/cve-2021-33909/sequoia-local-privilege-escalation-linux.txt>

CVE-2021-34693

    Norbert Slusarek discovered an information leak in the CAN BCM
    networking protocol. A local attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.194-3~deb9u1.  This additionally fixes a regression in the
previous update (#990072) that affected LXC.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.19 packages.

For the detailed security status of linux-4.19 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux-4.19>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

We discovered a size_t-to-int conversion vulnerability in the Linux
kernel's filesystem layer: by creating, mounting, and deleting a deep
directory structure whose total path length exceeds 1GB, an unprivileged
local attacker can write the 10-byte string "//deleted" to an offset of
exactly -2GB-10B below the beginning of a vmalloc()ated kernel buffer.

We successfully exploited this uncontrolled out-of-bounds write, and
obtained full root privileges on default installations of Ubuntu 20.04,
Ubuntu 20.10, Ubuntu 21.04, Debian 11, and Fedora 34 Workstation; other
Linux distributions are certainly vulnerable, and probably exploitable.
Our exploit requires approximately 5GB of memory and 1M inodes; we will
publish it in the near future. A basic proof of concept (a crasher) is
attached to this advisory and is available at:

<https://www.qualys.com/research/security-advisories/>

To the best of our knowledge, this vulnerability was introduced in July
2014 (Linux 3.16) by commit 058504ed ("fs/seq_file: fallback to vmalloc
allocation").

========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================

The Linux kernel's seq_file interface produces virtual files that
contain sequences of records (for example, many files in /proc are
seq_files, and records are usually lines). Each record must fit into a
seq_file buffer, which is therefore enlarged as needed, by doubling its
size at line 242 (seq_buf_alloc() is a simple wrapper around
kvmalloc()):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 168 ssize_t seq_read_iter(struct kiocb *iocb, struct iov_iter *iter)
 169 {
 170         struct seq_file *m = iocb->ki_filp->private_data;
 ...
 205         /* grab buffer if we didn't have one */
 206         if (!m->buf) {
 207                 m->buf = seq_buf_alloc(m->size = PAGE_SIZE);
 ...
 210         }
 ...
 220         // get a non-empty record in the buffer
 ...
 223         while (1) {
 ...
 227                 err = m->op->show(m, p);
 ...
 236                 if (!seq_has_overflowed(m)) // got it
 237                         goto Fill;
 238                 // need a bigger buffer
 ...
 240                 kvfree(m->buf);
 ...
 242                 m->buf = seq_buf_alloc(m->size <<= 1);
 ...
 246         }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This size multiplication is not a vulnerability in itself, because
m->size is a size_t (an unsigned 64-bit integer, on x86_64), and the
system would run out of memory long before this multiplication overflows
the integer m->size.

Unfortunately, this size_t is also passed to functions whose size
argument is an int (a signed 32-bit integer), not a size_t. For example,
the show_mountinfo() function (which is called at line 227 to format the
records in /proc/self/mountinfo) calls seq_dentry() (at line 150), which
calls dentry_path() (at line 530), which calls prepend() (at line 387):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
135 static int show_mountinfo(struct seq_file *m, struct vfsmount *mnt)
136 {
...
150                 seq_dentry(m, mnt->mnt_root, " \t\n\\");
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 523 int seq_dentry(struct seq_file *m, struct dentry *dentry, const char *esc)
 524 {
 525         char *buf;
 526         size_t size = seq_get_buf(m, &buf);
 ...
 529         if (size) {
 530                 char *p = dentry_path(dentry, buf, size);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
380 char *dentry_path(struct dentry *dentry, char *buf, int buflen)
381 {
382         char *p = NULL;
...
385         if (d_unlinked(dentry)) {
386                 p = buf + buflen;
387                 if (prepend(&p, &buflen, "//deleted", 10) != 0)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 11 static int prepend(char **buffer, int *buflen, const char *str, int namelen)
 12 {
 13         *buflen -= namelen;
 14         if (*buflen < 0)
 15                 return -ENAMETOOLONG;
 16         *buffer -= namelen;
 17         memcpy(*buffer, str, namelen);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a result, if an unprivileged local attacker creates, mounts, and
deletes a deep directory structure whose total path length exceeds 1GB,
and if the attacker open()s and read()s /proc/self/mountinfo, then:

- in seq_read_iter(), a 2GB buffer is vmalloc()ated (line 242), and
  show_mountinfo() is called (line 227);

- in show_mountinfo(), seq_dentry() is called with the empty 2GB buffer
  (line 150);

- in seq_dentry(), dentry_path() is called with a 2GB size (line 530);

- in dentry_path(), the int buflen is therefore negative (INT_MIN,
  -2GB), p points to an offset of -2GB below the vmalloc()ated buffer
  (line 386), and prepend() is called (line 387);

- in prepend(), *buflen is decreased by 10 bytes and becomes a large but
  positive int (line 13), *buffer is decreased by 10 bytes and points to
  an offset of -2GB-10B below the vmalloc()ated buffer (line 16), and
  the 10-byte string "//deleted" is written out of bounds (line 17).

========================================================================
Exploitation overview
========================================================================

1/ We mkdir() a deep directory structure (roughly 1M nested directories)
whose total path length exceeds 1GB, we bind-mount it in an unprivileged
user namespace, and rmdir() it.

2/ We create a thread that vmalloc()ates a small eBPF program (via
BPF_PROG_LOAD), and we block this thread (via userfaultfd or FUSE) after
our eBPF program has been validated by the kernel eBPF verifier but
before it is JIT-compiled by the kernel.

3/ We open() /proc/self/mountinfo in our unprivileged user namespace,
and start read()ing the long path of our bind-mounted directory, thereby
writing the string "//deleted" to an offset of exactly -2GB-10B below
the beginning of a vmalloc()ated buffer.

4/ We arrange for this "//deleted" string to overwrite an instruction of
our validated eBPF program (and therefore nullify the security checks of
the kernel eBPF verifier), and transform this uncontrolled out-of-bounds
write into an information disclosure, and into a limited but controlled
out-of-bounds write.

5/ We transform this limited out-of-bounds write into an arbitrary read
and write of kernel memory, by reusing Manfred Paul's beautiful btf and
map_push_elem techniques from:

<https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2020/4/8/cve-2020-8835-linux-kernel-privilege-escalation-via-improper-ebpf-program-verification>

6/ We use this arbitrary read to locate the modprobe_path[] buffer in
kernel memory, and use the arbitrary write to replace the contents of
this buffer ("/sbin/modprobe" by default) with a path to our own
executable, thus obtaining full root privileges.

========================================================================
Exploitation details
========================================================================

a/ We create a directory whose total path length exceeds 1GB: in theory,
we need to create over 1GB/256B=4M nested directories (NAME_MAX is 255);
in practice, show_mountinfo() replaces each '\\' character in our long
directory with the 4-byte string "\\134", and we therefore need to
create only 1M nested directories.

b/ We fill all large vmalloc holes: we bind-mount (MS_BIND) various
parts of our long directory in several unprivileged user namespaces and
vmalloc()ate large seq_file buffers by read()ing /proc/self/mountinfo.
For example, we vmalloc()ate 768MB of large buffers in our exploit.

c/ We vmalloc()ate two 1GB buffers and one 2GB buffer (by bind-mounting
our long directory in three different user namespaces, and by read()ing
/proc/self/mountinfo), and we check that "//deleted" is indeed written
to an offset of -2GB-10B below the beginning of our 2GB buffer (i.e.,
8182B above the beginning of our first 1GB buffer -- the "XXX"s are
guard pages):

        "//deleted"
             |
      4KB    v   1GB        4KB        1GB        4KB        2GB
-----|---|---+-------------|---|-----------------|---|-----------------|
 ... |XXX| seq_file buffer |XXX| seq_file buffer |XXX| seq_file buffer |
-----|---|---+-------------|---|-----------------|---|-----------------|
         |   |                                       |
         |   \----<----<----<----<----<----<----<----/
         8182B               -2GB-10B

d/ We fill all small vmalloc holes: we vmalloc()ate various small socket
buffers by send()ing numerous NETLINK_USERSOCK messages. For example, we
vmalloc()ate 256MB of small buffers in our exploit.

e/ We create 1024 user-space threads; each thread starts loading an eBPF
program into the kernel, but (via userfaultfd or FUSE) we block every
thread in kernel space (at line 2101), before our eBPF programs are
actually vmalloc()ated (at line 2162):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2076 static int bpf_prog_load(union bpf_attr *attr, union bpf_attr __user *uattr)
2077 {
....
2100         /* copy eBPF program license from user space */
2101         if (strncpy_from_user(license, u64_to_user_ptr(attr->license),
....
2161         /* plain bpf_prog allocation */
2162         prog = bpf_prog_alloc(bpf_prog_size(attr->insn_cnt), GFP_USER);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

f/ We vfree() our first 1GB seq_file buffer (where "//deleted" was
written out of bounds), and we immediately unblock all 1024 threads; our
eBPF programs are vmalloc()ated into the 1GB hole that we just vfree()d:

      4KB        1GB        4KB        1GB        4KB        2GB
-----|---|-----------------|---|-----------------|---|-----------------|
 ... |XXX|  eBPF programs  |XXX| seq_file buffer |XXX| seq_file buffer |
-----|---|-----------------|---|-----------------|---|-----------------|

g/ Next, (again via userfaultfd or FUSE) we block one of our threads (at
line 12795) after its eBPF program has been validated by the kernel eBPF
verifier but before it is JIT-compiled by the kernel:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
12640 int bpf_check(struct bpf_prog **prog, union bpf_attr *attr,
12641               union bpf_attr __user *uattr)
12642 {
.....
12795         print_verification_stats(env);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

h/ Last, we overwrite an instruction of this eBPF program with an
out-of-bounds "//deleted" string (again via our 2GB seq_file buffer),
and therefore nullify the security checks of the kernel eBPF verifier:

        "//deleted"
             |
      4KB    v   1GB        4KB        1GB        4KB        2GB
-----|---|---+-------------|---|-----------------|---|-----------------|
 ... |XXX|  eBPF programs  |XXX| seq_file buffer |XXX| seq_file buffer |
-----|---|---+-------------|---|-----------------|---|-----------------|
         |   |                                       |
         |   \----<----<----<----<----<----<----<----/
         8182B               -2GB-10B

First, we transform this uncontrolled eBPF-program corruption into an
information disclosure. Our first, uncorrupted eBPF program is deemed
safe by the kernel eBPF verifier ("storage" and "control" are two basic
BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAYs, readable and writable from user space via
BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM and BPF_MAP_UPDATE_ELEM):

- BPF_LD_IMM64_RAW(BPF_REG_2, BPF_PSEUDO_MAP_VALUE, storage) loads the
  address of our storage map (which resides in kernel space and whose
  address is unknown to us) into the eBPF register BPF_REG_2;

- BPF_MOV64_IMM(BPF_REG_2, 0) immediately replaces the contents of
  BPF_REG_2 (the address of our storage map) with the constant value 0;

- BPF_LD_IMM64_RAW(BPF_REG_3, BPF_PSEUDO_MAP_VALUE, control) loads the
  address of our control map into BPF_REG_3;

- BPF_STX_MEM(BPF_DW, BPF_REG_3, BPF_REG_2, 0) stores the contents of
  BPF_REG_2 (the constant value 0) into our control map.

However, our eBPF-program corruption overwrites the instruction
BPF_MOV64_IMM(BPF_REG_2, 0) with the 8-byte string "deleted", which
translates into the instruction BPF_ALU32_IMM(BPF_LSH, BPF_REG_5, 0x74):
a NOP ("no operation"), because our program does not use BPF_REG_5. As a
result, we do not store the constant value 0 into our control map:
instead, we store and disclose the address of our storage map.

(This information disclosure allowed us to greatly reduce the number of
hardcoded kernel offsets in our exploit: our Ubuntu 20.04 exploit worked
out of the box on Ubuntu 20.10, Ubuntu 21.04, Debian 11, and Fedora 34.)

Second, we transform our uncontrolled eBPF-program corruption into a
limited but controlled out-of-bounds write. Our second, uncorrupted eBPF
program is also deemed safe by the kernel eBPF verifier ("corrupt" is a
3*64KB BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY):

- BPF_LD_IMM64_RAW(BPF_REG_4, BPF_PSEUDO_MAP_VALUE, corrupt) loads the
  address of our corrupt map into BPF_REG_4;

- BPF_ALU64_IMM(BPF_ADD, BPF_REG_4, 3*64KB/2) points BPF_REG_4 to the
  middle of our corrupt map;

- BPF_ALU64_IMM(BPF_SUB, BPF_REG_4, 3*64KB/4) points BPF_REG_4 to the
  first quarter of our corrupt map;

- BPF_LD_IMM64_RAW(BPF_REG_3, BPF_PSEUDO_MAP_VALUE, control) loads the
  address of our control map into BPF_REG_3;

- BPF_LDX_MEM(BPF_H, BPF_REG_7, BPF_REG_3, 0) loads a variable 16-bit
  offset from our control map into BPF_REG_7;

- BPF_ALU64_REG(BPF_ADD, BPF_REG_4, BPF_REG_7) adds BPF_REG_7 (our
  variable 16-bit offset) to BPF_REG_4, which therefore points safely
  within the bounds of our corrupt map (because BPF_REG_7 is in the
  [0,64KB] range).

However, our eBPF-program corruption overwrites the instruction
BPF_ALU64_IMM(BPF_ADD, BPF_REG_4, 3*64KB/2) with the string "deleted",
which translates into BPF_ALU32_IMM(BPF_LSH, BPF_REG_5, 0x74) (a NOP).
As a result, the following BPF_ALU64_IMM(BPF_SUB, BPF_REG_4, 3*64KB/4)
points BPF_REG_4 out of bounds and allows us to read from and write to
the struct bpf_map that precedes our corrupt map in kernel space.

Finally, we transform this limited out-of-bounds read and write into an
arbitrary read and write of kernel memory, by reusing Manfred Paul's btf
and map_push_elem techniques:

- With the arbitrary kernel read we locate the symbol "__request_module"
  and hence the function __request_module(), disassemble this function,
  and extract the address of modprobe_path[] from the instructions for
  "if (!modprobe_path[0])".

- With the arbitrary kernel write we overwrite the contents of
  modprobe_path[] ("/sbin/modprobe" by default) with a path to our own
  executable, and call request_module() (by creating a netlink socket),
  which executes modprobe_path, and hence our own executable, as root.

========================================================================
Mitigations
========================================================================

Important note: the following mitigations prevent only our specific
exploit from working (but other exploitation techniques may exist); to
completely fix this vulnerability, the kernel must be patched.

- Set /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_userns_clone to 0, to prevent an
  attacker from mounting a long directory in a user namespace. However,
  the attacker may mount a long directory via FUSE instead; we have not
  fully explored this possibility, because we accidentally stumbled upon
  CVE-2021-33910 in systemd: if an attacker FUSE-mounts a long directory
  (longer than 8MB), then systemd exhausts its stack, crashes, and
  therefore crashes the entire operating system (a kernel panic).

- Set /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled to 1, to prevent an
  attacker from loading an eBPF program into the kernel. However, the
  attacker may corrupt other vmalloc()ated objects instead (for example,
  thread stacks), but we have not investigated this possibility.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.
