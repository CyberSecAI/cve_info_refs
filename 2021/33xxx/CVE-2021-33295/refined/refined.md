Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33295:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

   - The provided content directly mentions CVE-2021-33295 in the release notes of Joplin v1.8.5, confirming its relevance:
     ```
     Security: Filter out NOSCRIPT tags that could be used to cause an XSS ([CVE-2021-33295](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-phj8-2p6x-hq5r "CVE-2021-33295"))
     ```
   - The blog post from the-it-wonders.blogspot.com explicitly states the vulnerability and its CVE ID:
     ```
     Update Sept 2022: CVE assigned CVE-2021-33295
     https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2021-33295/
     ```
   - The GitHub Advisory also confirms the CVE ID: `CVE-2021-33295`

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

   - The root cause of the vulnerability is the improper sanitization of HTML input within the Joplin desktop application, specifically regarding `NOSCRIPT` tags.
   - This lack of proper sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of an XSS vulnerability, which can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts into the application.
   - **Inadequate HTML Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided HTML input, particularly the `NOSCRIPT` tag. This tag was not included in the list of disallowed tags initially.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

   - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code by injecting malicious scripts through the XSS vulnerability. This can lead to various malicious activities including but not limited to:
     - Data theft
     - Session hijacking
     - Account takeover
     - Other actions limited by the context of the application

**5. Attack Vectors**

   - The attack vector involves inserting a crafted payload containing a `NOSCRIPT` tag with malicious code within the Joplin app's main body.
   - The payload can be activated by toggling the editor or other actions that trigger HTML rendering.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

   - The attacker requires the ability to input content into the Joplin application, meaning a user account is needed.
   - No special privileges or server access is required, an authenticated user of Joplin is sufficient to inject the payload.
   - User interaction is required to trigger the payload.

**Additional Details**

  - **Payload:** The specific payload used in the proof-of-concept (POC) was:
      ```html
      <noscript><p title="</noscript><img src=x onerror=alert('testing')>">
      ```
  - **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed by filtering out `NOSCRIPT` tags in the `htmlUtils.ts` file. The commit introducing this fix is: `9c20d5947d1fa4678a8b640792ff3d31224f0adf`
  - **CVSS:** The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS v3 score of 5.4 (Medium severity) and a CVSS v2 score of 3.5 (Low Severity) by NIST.
  - **Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered by Jubair Rehman Yousafzai.

In summary, CVE-2021-33295 is an XSS vulnerability in the Joplin desktop application caused by insufficient sanitization of `NOSCRIPT` tags, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted payloads, impacting user confidentiality and integrity. This was resolved in version 1.8.5 by filtering out `noscript` tags.
