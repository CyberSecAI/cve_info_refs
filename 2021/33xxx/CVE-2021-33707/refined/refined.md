```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the fact that the SAP Portal Webdynpro `/tc~kmc~wdui~favorites/` `FavoritesApplication` is accessible remotely without authentication as a Guest user. This allows an attacker to craft malicious `Favorite` elements which can redirect the victim to an attacker-controlled website.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Open Redirection (CWE-601)",
    "Anonymous access to a component that allows manipulation of redirection targets"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to redirect users to arbitrary websites, potentially leading to phishing attacks. This can compromise the user's confidentiality and integrity.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious `Favorite` element in the vulnerable `FavoritesApplication` that redirects users to a website under the attacker's control.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote, requires no authentication and must be able to craft a specific payload"
