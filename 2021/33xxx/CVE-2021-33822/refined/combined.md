[![Build Status](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9b6f6a6989bc196bb1c0730457ef5eccf5318f940fad3b99af8b9daf899fd802/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f7368656b79616e2f736c6f7768747470746573742e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572)](https://travis-ci.org/shekyan/slowhttptest)

SlowHTTPTest is a highly configurable tool that simulates some Application Layer Denial of Service attacks by prolonging HTTP connections in different ways.

Use it to test your web server for DoS vulnerabilites, or just to figure out how many concurrent connections it can handle.
SlowHTTPTest works on majority of Linux platforms, OS X and Cygwin - a Unix-like environment and command-line interface for Microsoft Windows, and comes with a Dockerfile to make things even easier.

Check out [Wiki](https://github.com/shekyan/slowhttptest/wiki) for installation and usage details.

Latest official image is available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/shekyan/slowhttptest):
`docker pull shekyan/slowhttptest:latest`

## [Description]

An issue was discovered on 4GEE ROUTER HH70VB Version HH70\_E1\_02.00\_22. Attackers can use slowhttptest tool to send incomplete HTTP request, which could make server keep waiting for the packet to finish the connection, until its resource exhausted. Then the web server is denial-of-service.

## [Attack Type]

Remote

## [Product]

4GEE ROUTER HH70VB

## [Version]

HH70\_E1\_02.00\_22

## 4GEE ROUTER HH70VB devices vulnerability

### Demonstration

Normally, 4GEE ROUTER HH70VB ’s web login screenshot is like this. As shown below:

[![](https://github.com/Jian-Xian/CVE-POC/raw/master/picture/CVE-2021-33822_1.png)](https://github.com/Jian-Xian/CVE-POC/blob/master/picture/CVE-2021-33822_1.png)

By using slowhttptest tool to attack to 4GEE ROUTER HH70VB ’s web server, keep it waiting for response until its resource exhausted, therefore achieves Slow HTTP DoS Attack. If attack cause web server out of service successf ully, option service available will show text NO with red color. As shown below:

It could not be accessed when attack success. As shown below:
