Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33057:

**Verification:**

The content from arxiv.org explicitly mentions the assignment of CVE-2021-33057 to a vulnerability related to mini-program permissions. The github content contains a file named "QQ applet location permission vulnerability report.pdf" which is likely related to the described issue. This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause lies in the improper permission management and encapsulation within mini-program frameworks, specifically how host apps handle and delegate permissions to their embedded mini-programs. The core issue is that mini-programs inherit permissions from their host app, and if a host app improperly manages permissions or exposes vulnerable APIs, it can lead to security breaches.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Permission Encapsulation in Leaked APIs (PEL-API):** Some APIs related to sensitive permissions lack proper permission checks. This allows mini-programs to directly access these permissions without user consent or even if the user has explicitly denied them. This includes:
        *   **Qualified Conditions Ignored:**  APIs that should require user interaction to access data are accessible without user interaction if the host app has the permission, leading to potential unauthorized access.
        *   **Forgotten APIs Under Permission Control:** Some APIs that should require permission checks do not, allowing access to sensitive data without authorization.
        *   **Parameter Settings Ignored:** API parameters can be manipulated to bypass permission requirements, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive information.
        *   **Invalid Permission Settings:** Inconsistencies between official API documentation and actual permission requirements can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Stealthily Transferring Sensitive Data:**
        *   **Vertical:** Some host apps may skip requesting permissions from users for mini-programs, and directly transmit sensitive information to the mini program.
        *   **Horizontal:** Mini-programs from the same company may share user information without user consent.
    *   **Permission Management Issues:**
        *   Permissions settings may disappear preventing user revocation.
        *   Permissions may not be deleted, allowing for continuous unauthorized data collection.
        *   The user's sensitive information may be retained even after deletion.
    *  **Webview Bypasses Permission Control:** Mini-programs can use the web-view component to load web pages, which can bypass permission controls and gain access to sensitive data.
    *  **Permission Issues in Different Environments**: Inconsistent handling of API calls across different OS versions can lead to vulnerabilities
    *   **Reuse Cache Files:** Temporary files created by mini-programs are not always deleted when the user exits the mini-program, allowing attackers to reuse cached files.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Privacy Violation:** Attackers can steal sensitive user information, such as location, contacts, clipboard data, and potentially other personal information.
    *   **Tracking & Personal Attacks:** Unauthorized access to location information can enable tracking, leading to potential harm to the user.
    *   **Fraud:** Access to contacts and other sensitive data can facilitate fraud and phishing attacks.
    *   **Abuse of personal information:** Attackers can collect personal information to push advertisements or conduct analysis of user behavior.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Mini-Programs:** Attackers can develop malicious mini-programs that exploit the vulnerabilities described.
    *   **Compromised Host Apps:** Vulnerabilities in the host app itself can also expose user data to malicious mini-programs.
    *   **Bypassing User Authorization:** Through API vulnerabilities, attackers can access sensitive data even if the user has not granted the necessary permissions.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Ability to Develop Mini-Programs:** Attackers need to be able to create and publish mini-programs on the affected platforms.
    *   **Knowledge of Vulnerable APIs:** Attackers need knowledge of the vulnerable APIs and their specific weaknesses in order to exploit them.
    *   **User Interaction (in some cases):** Some attacks may require users to click on an element or button.

**Additional Information:**
*   The research analyzed 9 popular mini-program ecosystems, revealing that most had at least one vulnerability
*   Proof-of-concept attacks, such as location information attacks, contacts attacks, and clipboard content attacks, are detailed.
*   The paper mentions a responsible disclosure process, including reporting the vulnerabilities to the Tencent Security Response Center and obtaining CVE numbers for some.
* The github content has a file called "QQ applet location permission vulnerability report.pdf" which suggests a specific instance of such vulnerability.
