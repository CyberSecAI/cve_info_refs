Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The CommScope Ruckus IoT Controller OVA contains a hardcoded password for an administrative-level web application account named 'nplus1user'. This account is undocumented and the password cannot be changed through the web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Hardcoded Password:** The 'nplus1user' account has a default, unchangeable password of 'nplus1user'.
*   **Undocumented Account:** The existence of 'nplus1user' is not documented, adding to the obscurity and potential for misuse.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can gain administrative access to the web application by using the hardcoded password of 'nplus1user' which would likely lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker with network access to the web application interface can attempt to log in with the hardcoded credentials.
*   **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the virtual appliance can extract the credentials from the filesystem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application interface to attempt login.
*  **Local Access (for credential extraction):** Alternatively, local access to the virtual appliance's file system allows an attacker to view the clear text password.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in CommScope Ruckus IoT Controller versions 1.7.1.0 and earlier.
*   The 'admin' account is also present and has a documented password that can be changed.
*   The advisory includes a proof-of-concept showing the location of the hardcoded password in the virtual appliance's file system.
*   The vendor has released version 1.8.0.0 of the firmware to remediate the vulnerability.
