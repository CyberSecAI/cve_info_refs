Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2021-33493:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The middleware component of OX App Suite uses YAML for complex configuration constructs. The YAML parser used has an insecure parsing method.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Code Injection (CWE-94)
- Insecure YAML parsing which allows injection of arbitrary YAML-formatted Java classes which would then be executed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Java code execution in the context of the middleware process.
- Malicious modification of configuration files leading to malfunction or service unavailability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious modification of configuration files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A user with high privileges or a compromised workload is required to modify configuration files.
- The attacker needs the ability to modify the YAML configuration files.
- Exploiting this vulnerability is likely to cause malfunction of the service.
