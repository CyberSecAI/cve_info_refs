Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33336:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `journal` module of Liferay Portal. Specifically, the `_com_liferay_journal_web_portlet_JournalPortlet_name` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code. This malicious code is then stored and executed when other users interact with the affected component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Web Script Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML into the Liferay Portal.
*   **Potentially Sensitive Actions:** An attacker could execute malicious scripts in the context of other users' sessions. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the portal, or the execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of other users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **_com_liferay_journal_web_portlet_JournalPortlet_name parameter:** The attacker injects malicious code into this parameter, likely when creating or editing a journal structure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the journal module in Liferay Portal and have the ability to manipulate the `_com_liferay_journal_web_portlet_JournalPortlet_name` parameter. The specific level of access or privileges required may vary based on the environment.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability affects Liferay Portal versions 7.3.0 through 7.3.3.
* A fix has been implemented in Liferay Portal version 7.3.4.
