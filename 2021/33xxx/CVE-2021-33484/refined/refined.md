{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application uses a hardcoded IV for encryption and transmits encrypted data including an encryption key to the client.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Hardcoded IV",
      "Exposure of encryption key",
      "Lack of proper input validation or sanitization",
        "Lack of authentication enforcement when adding comments"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can decrypt the encryption key, spoof users, and add/delete comments as any user by manipulating encrypted user information. It also allows for stored XSS via comment field injection.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Decompilation of the application's module installer to discover the hardcoded IV.",
      "Manipulating the 'displayname' parameter in requests to decrypt the encryption key and other values",
      "Crafting malicious requests to the 'CommentsService.ashx' endpoint to add or modify comments and to spoof users",
        "Injecting XSS payloads into the 'comment' parameter"
    ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs access to the application's installer to decompile the module, then they can send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint"
