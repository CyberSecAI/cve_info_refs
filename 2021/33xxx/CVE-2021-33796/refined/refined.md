- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A use-after-free vulnerability exists due to the incorrect assumption that the regular expression source string is always interned and thus never freed. When a regular expression object is garbage collected, its underlying source string can be freed. Subsequent access to the "source" property can lead to a use-after-free if the source string has been freed.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free. The code incorrectly uses `js_pushliteral`, which assumes that the string is interned, instead of `js_pushstring` which correctly handles non-interned strings.

- **Impact of exploitation**: The use-after-free could lead to memory corruption, which could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to trigger garbage collection of a regular expression object, then access the source property of that object after it has been collected and its source string has been freed.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to have the ability to execute Javascript code that could create regular expressions, trigger garbage collection, and access the "source" property of the freed regular expression objects.
