Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33479:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `measure_pitch()` function within the `pgm2asc.c` file of the GOCR software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is a stack-based buffer overflow. This occurs when the program writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The Gentoo Security Advisory states the worst case could lead to arbitrary code execution. This means a successful exploit could allow an attacker to run malicious code on the affected system.
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry mentions this vulnerability exists in gocr through 0.53-20200802.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted image by GOCR, which would trigger the buffer overflow in the vulnerable function. The specific details of crafting such an image is not provided.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to supply a malicious image to be processed by the vulnerable software, specifically targeting the affected `measure_pitch()` function in `pgm2asc.c`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Gentoo advisory explicitly states that GOCR is no longer supported. Users are recommended to unmerge the package.
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry indicates the vulnerability does not affect commercially supported Red Hat products.
- There are no workarounds described, and a fix requires updating/removing the vulnerable software.
- The Gentoo advisory also lists related CVEs: CVE-2021-33480 and CVE-2021-33481, but those are not analyzed here.
