Subject: [CVE-2021-43523] Incorrect handling of special characters in domain
 names in uclibc and uclibc-ng

Security Issue: Incorrect handling of special characters in domain names
in uclibc and uclibc-ng

#### Description of the vulnerability

Incorrect handling of special characters in domain names returned by
Domain Name Servers in uclibc and uclibc-ng below 1.0.39 via the
gethostbyname(), getaddrinfo(), gethostbyaddr() and getnameinfo() calls
can lead to output of wrong hostnames (leading to Domain Hijacking) and
injection vulnerabilities in applications using the library (leading to
Remote Code Execution, XSS, Applications crashes, etc.).

Examples of incorrect behavior:

     example.com\000.attacker.com is returned as example.com
     www\.example.com is returned as www.example.com
     <script>alert('xss')</script>.attacker.com is not filtered even
though this is not a valid hostname.

#### CVE ID

This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-43523.

#### Patch

This vulnerability was patched with uclibc-ng version 1.0.39:

<https://github.com/wbx-github/uclibc-ng/commit/0f822af0445e5348ce7b7bd8ce1204244f31d174>

#### Attack vector(s):

Lookup of attacker controlled domain name or other cases where an
attacker can control the DNS response returned by used DNS servers.

#### Attack type

Context-dependent

#### Impact

Impact depends on the application using the libc stub resolver. In case
a cache is implemented, misinterpretation of \000 or \. can lead to
cache poisoning. In case unfiltered input is processed, this can lead to
XSS, SQL-injection, etc. We are aware of applications which are
vulnerable due to such stub-resolver behavior, such as CVE-2021-33425.

#### Affected Components:

DNS resolver library functions `gethostbyname()`, `getaddrinfo()`,
`gethostbyaddr()` and `getnameinfo()`.

#### Additional information

The POSIX Standard for Information Technology [1] defines interfaces for
DNS lookups in systems standard C libraries. This Standard includes
functions for forward lookups (gethostbyname, getaddrinfo) as well as
backward-lookups (gethostbyaddr, getnameinfo). These functions cannot
only return IP addresses but can also contain hostnames of aliases
(CNAME) of the requested host name in case of forward-lookups, or the
primary host name of that ip address in the case of backward-lookups
(PTR). The POSIX Standard defines the data format of these host names as
a null-terminated C-String containing a "hostname" or "nodename", which
are typically expected by developers and defined by RFC952 [2] and
RFC1123 [3] to only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z,A-Z,0-9),
hyphens ("-") and periods (".") to split labels. This creates a mismatch
of allowed characters between "hostnames" and "domain names" as defined
by the DNS standard [4] which defines "domain names" as a series of
"text labels" which are textually represented by concatenating all "text
labels" and joining them together with period signs. However, "text
labels" can contain any octet value, even zero-bytes ("\x00") and period
signs (".") and recursive DNS resolvers are required by the DNS standard
to support any of these characters in DNS records, thus not implementing
any sanitiy checks on domain names.

When DNS responses are parsed by the stub DNS resolver implemented by
stub resolver library as part of the `gethostbyname()`, `getaddrinfo()`,
`gethostbyaddr()` and `getnameinfo()` functions, these functions must
therefore ensure that the returned, null-terminated C-Strings must be
valid domain names as defined by the POSIX standard, else applications
which use these values might include that information in contexts where
malicious data can included inside the domain name and used for command
injection attacks like Cross-Site-Scripting, SQL-injections, etc.
Furthermore, if domain names contain text labels with periods (`"\."`)
or zero-bytes (`"\000"`) and the stub resolver library does naively
decode these domain names into strings, attackers can create malicious
domain names which are misinterpreted by the naive decoding logic to
look like different domain names than they actually are. When these
misinterpreted domain names are than cached by applications using the
stub resolver, this allows for domain hijacking by poisoning of the
applications DNS cache which uses the vulnerable stub resolver library.

For an example on how stub resolvers should sanitize domain names
returned by those functions, we refer to the `ns_name_ntop` [5] and
`res_hnok` [6] functions in glibc.
