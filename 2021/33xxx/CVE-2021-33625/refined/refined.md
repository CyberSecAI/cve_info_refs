  "CVE-2021-33625": {
    "match": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "Software SMI services that use the Communicate() function of the EFI_SMM_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL do not check whether the address of the buffer is valid, which allows use of SMRAM, MMIO, or OS kernel addresses.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SMM memory corruption vulnerability.",
         "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could write fixed or predictable data to SMRAM. Exploiting this issue could lead to escalating privileges to SMM.  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
       "attack_vectors": [
         "Local Access"
       ],
