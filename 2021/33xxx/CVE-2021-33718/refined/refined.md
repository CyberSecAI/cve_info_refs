- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect authorization check in Mendix applications.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in the improper access control that allows bypassing write permissions to attributes of objects under specific conditions. Specifically, if a user has write permission to the first attribute of an object, they could potentially bypass write restrictions on other attributes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could bypass write permissions and modify object attributes that they are not supposed to. This could result in unauthorized data modification and potential impact on the application's intended functionality and data integrity.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access is needed. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires low privileges and network access. They need to have write permissions to the first attribute of the targeted object.
