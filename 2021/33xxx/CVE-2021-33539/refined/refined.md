- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authentication in hostname processing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass. The device incorrectly interprets remote traffic as local traffic based on a specially configured hostname.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows an attacker to bypass web authentication and potentially gain unauthorized access or control.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted authenticated SNMP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to send authenticated SNMP requests.
