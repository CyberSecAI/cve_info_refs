Based on the provided content, here's an analysis regarding CVE-2021-33634:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content includes a pull request on gitee.com for the `src-openeuler/lcr` repository with the title  "set env to avoid invoke lxc binary directly" and the description contains the tag `#I842X9:CVE-2021-33634`. This pull request is directly related to the mentioned CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is related to how the `lxc` binary is invoked. The patch aims to avoid invoking the `lxc` binary directly, suggesting that the direct invocation was the source of the security issue. The commit message "set env to avoid invoke lxc binary directly" indicates that the previous method of invoking `lxc` was insecure and potentially exploitable.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The vulnerability likely stems from a lack of proper sanitization or handling of user-provided input when interacting with the `lxc` binary, leading to command injection, or other related issues. The fix implies a vulnerability where an attacker could manipulate the environment or parameters of the `lxc` binary invocation to execute arbitrary commands or perform unauthorized actions.
* **Impact of exploitation:** The impact of the vulnerability would be the ability to run arbitrary commands, potentially compromising the container or the host. This could lead to data breaches, privilege escalation, or denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors**: The primary attack vector involves manipulating the environment or arguments used when the `lxc` binary is invoked. This likely involves injecting malicious code into the parameters used by `lxc`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: An attacker would need the capability to influence the environment or input parameters used when the `lxc` binary is invoked. Depending on how the invocation was implemented, this could involve a compromised application or container.

**3. Additional Details:**
  * The pull request aims to fix the vulnerability by setting the environment to avoid directly invoking the lxc binary. This implies that the vulnerability was present in the previous direct invocation method.
  * The patch is targeted for the `openEuler-22.03-LTS` branch.
  * The presence of reviewers like `haomintsai`, `JingWoo` and others implies a formal review process before merging.
  * The associated issue is I842X9.

**4. Additional Notes:**

*   The information is based on the pull request details, especially the commit message and the CVE tag.
*   The specific exploit details are not provided in the given text but the context clearly points to the vulnerability being related to how `lxc` is invoked and how this method is vulnerable to manipulation.

In summary, the provided content indicates a vulnerability (CVE-2021-33634) in the `src-openeuler/lcr` repository related to the direct invocation of the `lxc` binary, which has been addressed in a pull request by avoiding direct invocation, with details suggesting the potential for command injection or similar attacks by manipulating input/environment when invoking `lxc`.
