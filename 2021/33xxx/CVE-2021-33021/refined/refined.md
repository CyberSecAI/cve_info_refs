The provided content is related to CVE-2021-33021.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically cross-site scripting (XSS) in the xArrow SCADA software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the lack of proper input sanitization. This vulnerability is present in two distinct resources:
    - Parameter 'edate' of the resource xhisalarm.htm
    - Parameter 'bdate' of the resource xhisvalue.htm
- Improper Input Validation: The affected product permits unvalidated registry keys to be run with application-level privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to:
- Remote code execution.
- Execution of arbitrary code by an unauthorized attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack, exploiting the web interface of the SCADA software.
- The XSS vulnerability can be triggered via crafted URLs containing malicious scripts in the `edate` or `bdate` parameters.
- Local access, exploiting unvalidated registry keys.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker:
    - For the XSS vulnerability, the attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and induce a user to click on it. The attack has low complexity and does not require prior access.
- Local attacker:
   - For the Improper Input Validation vulnerability, the attacker needs to have local access and be able to manipulate registry keys. The attack has low complexity and requires low privileges.

**Additional details:**

- The affected product is xArrow SCADA/HMI versions 7.2 and prior.
- The advisory also mentions two other related vulnerabilities, CVE-2021-33001 and CVE-2021-33025.
- The vendor has not responded to requests to work with CISA to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
- The affected systems are deployed worldwide in Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems.
