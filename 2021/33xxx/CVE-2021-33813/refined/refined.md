  "CVE-2021-33813": {
    "Description": "The JDOM library, in versions 2.0.6 and earlier, is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection via the SAXBuilder class. The `setFeature` method, which should disable external entities, is overridden by the entity expansion settings. This can allow attackers to cause a denial of service using crafted HTTP requests, such as the billion laughs attack. The recommended workaround is to explicitly set `builder.setExpandEntities(false)`. This will prevent external entities from being expanded.",
    "Root cause": "The `setFeature` method for disabling external entities in the JDOM library's SAXBuilder class is not being prioritized over entity expansion settings. The entity expansion setting takes precedence and therefore enables external entities regardless of the feature settings.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) Injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker can craft a malicious XML payload that exploits the XXE vulnerability to consume excessive resources, potentially leading to application crashes or unavailability.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network",
       "HTTP request with a specially crafted XML payload"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request containing a malicious XML document to a vulnerable application utilizing the JDOM library"
  }
