Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-supplied input in the login functionality of the `cms-corephp` application. Specifically, the username and password fields are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly incorporates user-provided input into an SQL query without proper escaping or using parameterized queries, allowing attackers to manipulate the query's structure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the login authentication by injecting SQL code into the username or password fields. Specifically, the provided Proof of Concept (PoC) `1' or 1=1#` demonstrates that an attacker can log in without providing the correct credentials.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successfully exploiting the SQL injection allows an attacker to access the administrative interface, potentially leading to further compromise, such as data theft or modification.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Login Form:** The primary attack vector is the user login form. The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the username or password input fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs access to the application's login page to submit the malicious input.
