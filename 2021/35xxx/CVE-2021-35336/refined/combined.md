# Bug Description:

A vulnerability in the WMT Playout Server‚Äôs Web Administrative Interface on Version 20.2.8 and Below Could allow an Unauthenticated Remote User to access a sensitive part of the system with a high privileged account.

This Vulnerability is Due to the Presence of Default Account that has a default Password ‚Äúpokon‚Äù in it. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using this default account to connect to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain read and write access to system data, including the configuration of the affected devices. The attacker would gain access to a sensitive portion of the system and have full administrative rights to control the device. Leading to Increase in the Severity of the Vulnerability.

# Attack Vector:

A Malicious attacker could exploit this vulnerability by remotely Logging in to an affected system by using the Default Credentials.

# **Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Go to The Playout Server Login page

![]()

2. Leave the Username Field blank

3. Enter ‚Äúpokon‚Äù on Password Field and Click Sign in

4. Now You are Redirected to the Administrative Panel Where You can Able to Read and Control the Device and also Able to change the device‚Äôs Configuration Remotely.

Introducing the Gateway Multichannel IP Audio Codec

### Overview

#### The Most powerful DSP-based 1RU IP Codec

The Tieline Gateway introduces a new era in high-density multichannel IP codec streaming. The Gateway supports up to 16 mono channels or 8 stereo streams of bidirectional IP audio in 1RU to increase efficiency and reduce rack space requirements. It interfaces easily with legacy analog and AES/EBU digital sources, as well as newer broadcast plants with AES67, ST 2110-30, ST 2022-7, Livewire+, RAVENNA, NMOS, and Ember+. An optional WheatNet-IP card is also available.

The Gateway is perfect for large-scale audio distribution to single or multiple locations, as well as managing multiple incoming remotes at the studio using SmartStream PLUS redundant IP streaming and Fuse-IP data aggregation technologies over internet connections. It is interoperable with all Tieline IP codecs and compatible over SIP with all EBU N/ACIP Tech 3326, 3347 and 3368 compliant codecs and devices.

### Applications

Perfect for STL, SSL and audio distribution applications, with support for multicasting and multiple unicasting technologies. It is also perfect for managing multiple incoming remotes at the studio and can simultaneously connect to up to 16 hardware codecs or¬†Report-IT Enterprise smartphone app users.

* Studio-To-Transmitter Links (STL)
* Studio-To-Studio Links (SSL)
* Audio Distribution
* Managing multiple incoming remotes at the studio

### Multiple Backup Options

The Gateway has multiple levels¬†of power, audio and network redundancy. The codec features dual Gigabit Ethernet¬†ports, dual internal power supplies, automated audio silence detection¬†and IP network backup solutions to¬†ensure you‚Äôre always on the air.

Automated network failure detection provides auto switching to a backup IP connection. The codec can¬†automatically switch between 4 backup audio sources to maintain program output at transmitter sites. Options include:

* Connection audio.
* Icecast streaming client.
* Audio file backup.
* Hardware bypass of audio inputs to outputs if power fails.
