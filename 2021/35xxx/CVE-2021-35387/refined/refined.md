The provided content describes a vulnerability in the "Hospital Management System" PHP project, specifically a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization or parameterized queries in the `view-patient.php` script, allowing direct injection of SQL code via the `viewid` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, retrieve sensitive information, modify or delete data, or even gain control of the underlying system. In this case, the attacker can retrieve the current database name.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `view-patient.php` with a crafted `viewid` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated, as the vulnerability is in a publicly accessible endpoint.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability is demonstrated using a `sqlmap` command: `sqlmap.py -u <http://192.168.50.34/Hospital%20Management%20System%20Project/hospital/hms/admin/view-patient.php?viewid=1> --batch --current-db`
- This command confirms the existence of SQL injection and retrieves the current database name.
