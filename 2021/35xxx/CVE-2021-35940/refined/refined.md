  "CVE-2021-35940": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds array read in the apr_time_exp*() functions. This issue was previously fixed in APR 1.6.3 (CVE-2017-12613), but the fix was not included in the 1.7.x branch, causing a regression in version 1.7.0.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is a missing fix for an out-of-bounds array dereference that was previously addressed in version 1.6.3, but not carried over to the 1.7.x branch, specifically in the apr_time_exp*() functions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds array read."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially cause a denial-of-service or possibly lead to other undefined behavior due to the out-of-bounds read.",
        "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered via the apr_time_exp*() functions. The specific input or conditions that cause the out-of-bounds read is not explicit in the provided content.",
        "The affected functions operate on time structures and date fields. Exploitation would depend on supplying carefully crafted or invalid date/time components which leads to the out-of-bounds read."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to supply data or influence parameters that control the input values for the time structures, to trigger the out of bounds read in `apr_time_exp*()` functions. The exact capabilities and/or position are not explicit from the provided content"

    "fixed_versions": [
        "The vulnerability was fixed by restoring the fix from CVE-2017-12613 in the APR 1.7.x branch via revision 1891198."
