Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35955:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of untrusted backend users to inject malicious code into HTML attributes within the Contao backend. This occurs specifically in fields that allow HTML modification, such as those using TinyMCE.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via HTML attributes. The vulnerability allows for the injection of malicious code within HTML attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Malicious code execution. The injected code will be executed both in the backend element preview and on the website frontend, potentially leading to various malicious activities.
- Compromised user accounts or data manipulation. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized actions within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network based attack vector. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely
- Attack vector is via the backend interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an untrusted backend user with permissions to modify HTML fields (e.g., via TinyMCE).
- Low privileges are required
- User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability (i.e. accessing the malicious code).
- The attacker needs network access to the application

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered moderate severity, with a CVSS v3 score of 4.6.
- The vulnerability impacts Contao versions >=4.0.0.
- Patched versions are 4.4.56, 4.9.18, and 4.11.7.
- Workarounds include disabling HTML fields for untrusted users or disabling their login access.
- The vulnerability was reported by Mikhail Khramenkov and Moritz Vondano.
