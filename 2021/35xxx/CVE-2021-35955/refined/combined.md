# Cross site scripting via HTML attributes in the back end

Moderate

[leofeyer](/leofeyer)
published
GHSA-hr3h-x6gq-rqcp
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

composer

contao/core-bundle
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>=4.0.0

## Patched versions

4.4.56, 4.9.18, 4.11.7

## Description

### Impact

It is possible for untrusted users to inject malicious code into HTML attributes in the back end, which will be executed both in the element preview (back end) and on the website (front end).

Installations are only affected if there are untrusted back end users who have the rights to modify HTML fields (e.g. TinyMCE).

### Patches

Update to Contao 4.4.56, 4.9.18 or 4.11.7

### Workarounds

Disable all fields that allow HTML for untrusted back end users or disable the login for these users.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
