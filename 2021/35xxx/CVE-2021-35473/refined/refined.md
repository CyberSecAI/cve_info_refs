Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35473:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the OAuth2 handler in LemonLDAP::NG not verifying the validity of access tokens. Specifically, it fails to check if an access token has expired before granting access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Access Token Validation:** The OAuth2 handler does not validate the expiry of access tokens before processing requests.
*   **Reliance on OIDC Session:** The handler appears to rely on the OIDC session, but does not check if the token associated with the session is still valid.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker with an expired access token can gain unauthorized access to resources protected by the OAuth2 handler.
*   **Bypass Access Control:** The vulnerability allows bypassing the intended access control mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Expired Access Token Replay:** An attacker can use an expired access token obtained earlier to gain access.
*   **Timing Window:** The attacker would need to obtain a valid access token, allow it to expire and then use it again to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid (Initially) Access Token:** The attacker must initially have a valid access token obtained legitimately (e.g. through an OIDC client).
*  **Network Access**: Ability to send request to the LemonLDAP::NG OAuth2 handler.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability affects versions 2.0.4 to 2.0.11 of LemonLDAP::NG.
* The logs provided in the report indicate the exact point where the validation is missing.
* The issue was reported on GitLab.
