  "CVE-2021-35492": {
    "description": "A remote user, authenticated to the Wowza Streaming Engine web interface, through Virtual Host Monitoring section, could exhaust filesystem resources, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected application. This vulnerability is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by requesting random virtual host historical data and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the application to an operational state.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient management of available filesystem resources when handling requests for virtual host historical data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The attacker can cause database errors and make the device unresponsive to web-based management, requiring manual intervention to restore the application to an operational state.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered through HTTP requests to the `/enginemanager/server/vhost/historical.jsdata` endpoint by manipulating the `vhost` parameter.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated on the Wowza Streaming Engine web interface and have privileges to view Virtual Host Monitoring information."
