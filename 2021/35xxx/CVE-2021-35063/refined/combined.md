# 2.3. Understanding a Bug[¶](#understanding-a-bug "Link to this heading")

The core of Bugzilla is the screen which displays a particular
bug. Note that the labels for most fields are hyperlinks;
clicking them will take you to context-sensitive help on that
particular field. Fields marked \* may not be present on every
installation of Bugzilla.

*Summary:*

A one-sentence summary of the problem, displayed in the header next to
the bug number.

*Status (and Resolution):*

These define exactly what state the bug is in—from not even
being confirmed as a bug, through to being fixed and the fix
confirmed by Quality Assurance. The different possible values for
Status and Resolution on your installation should be documented in the
context-sensitive help for those items.

*Alias:*

A unique short text name for the bug, which can be used instead of the
bug number.

*Product and Component*:

Bugs are divided up by Product and Component, with a Product
having one or more Components in it.

*Version:*

The “Version” field usually contains the numbers or names of released
versions of the product. It is used to indicate the version(s) affected by
the bug report.

*Hardware (Platform and OS):*

These indicate the computing environment where the bug was
found.

*Importance (Priority and Severity):*

The Priority field is used to prioritize bugs, either by the assignee,
or someone else with authority to direct their time such as a project
manager. It’s a good idea not to change this on other people’s bugs. The
default values are P1 to P5.

The Severity field indicates how severe the problem is—from blocker
(“application unusable”) to trivial (“minor cosmetic issue”). You
can also use this field to indicate whether a bug is an enhancement
request.

*\*Target Milestone:*

A future version by which the bug is to
be fixed. e.g. The Bugzilla Project’s milestones for future
Bugzilla versions are 4.4, 5.0, 6.0, etc. Milestones are not
restricted to numbers, though—you can use any text strings, such
as dates.

*Assigned To:*

The person responsible for fixing the bug.

*\*QA Contact:*

The person responsible for quality assurance on this bug.

*URL:*

A URL associated with the bug, if any.

*\*Whiteboard:*

A free-form text area for adding short notes and tags to a bug.

*Keywords:*

The administrator can define keywords which you can use to tag and
categorise bugs—e.g. `crash` or `regression`.

*Personal Tags:*

Unlike Keywords which are global and visible by all users, Personal Tags
are personal and can only be viewed and edited by their author. Editing
them won’t send any notifications to other users. Use them to tag and keep
track of sets of bugs that you personally care about, using your own
classification system.

*Dependencies (Depends On and Blocks):*

If this bug cannot be fixed unless other bugs are fixed (depends
on), or this bug stops other bugs being fixed (blocks), their
numbers are recorded here.

Clicking the Dependency tree link shows
the dependency relationships of the bug as a tree structure.
You can change how much depth to show, and you can hide resolved bugs
from this page. You can also collapse/expand dependencies for
each non-terminal bug on the tree view, using the [-]/[+] buttons that
appear before the summary.

*Reported:*

The person who filed the bug, and the date and time they did it.

*Modified:*

The date and time the bug was last changed.

*CC List:*

A list of people who get mail when the bug changes, in addition to the
Reporter, Assignee and QA Contact (if enabled).

*Ignore Bug Mail:*

Set this if you want never to get bugmail from this bug again. See also
[Email Preferences](preferences.html#emailpreferences).

*\*See Also:*

Bugs, in this Bugzilla, other Bugzillas, or other bug trackers, that are
related to this one.

*Flags:*

A flag is a kind of status that can be set on bugs or attachments
to indicate that the bugs/attachments are in a certain state.
Each installation can define its own set of flags that can be set
on bugs or attachments. See [Flags](#flags).

*\*Time Tracking:*

This form can be used for time tracking.
To use this feature, you have to be a member of the group
specified by the timetrackinggroup parameter. See
[Time Tracking](editing.html#time-tracking) for more information.

Orig. Est.:

This field shows the original estimated time.

Current Est.:

This field shows the current estimated time.
This number is calculated from `Hours Worked`
and `Hours Left`.

Hours Worked:

This field shows the number of hours worked.

Hours Left:

This field shows the `Current Est.` -
`Hours Worked`.
This value + `Hours Worked` will become the
new Current Est.

%Complete:

This field shows what percentage of the task is complete.

Gain:

This field shows the number of hours that the bug is ahead of the
`Orig. Est.`.

Deadline:

This field shows the deadline for this bug.

*Attachments:*

You can attach files (e.g. test cases or patches) to bugs. If there
are any attachments, they are listed in this section. See
[Attachments](editing.html#attachments) for more information.

*Additional Comments:*

You can add your two cents to the bug discussion here, if you have
something worthwhile to say.

## 2.3.1. Flags[¶](#flags "Link to this heading")

Flags are a way to attach a specific status to a bug or attachment,
either `+` or `-`. The meaning of these symbols depends on the name of
the flag itself, but contextually they could mean pass/fail,
accept/reject, approved/denied, or even a simple yes/no. If your site
allows requestable flags, then users may set a flag to `?` as a
request to another user that they look at the bug/attachment and set
the flag to its correct status.

A set flag appears in bug reports and on “edit attachment” pages with the
abbreviated username of the user who set the flag prepended to the
flag name. For example, if Jack sets a “review” flag to `+`, it appears
as Jack: review [ + ].

A requested flag appears with the user who requested the flag prepended
to the flag name and the user who has been requested to set the flag
appended to the flag name within parentheses. For example, if Jack
asks Jill for review, it appears as Jack: review [ ? ] (Jill).

You can browse through open requests made of you and by you by selecting
My Requests from the footer. You can also look at open requests
limited by other requesters, requestees, products, components, and flag names.
Note that you can use ‘-’ for requestee to specify flags with no requestee
set.

### 2.3.1.1. A Simple Example[¶](#a-simple-example "Link to this heading")

A developer might want to ask their manager,
“Should we fix this bug before we release version 2.0?”
They might want to do this for a *lot* of bugs,
so they decide to streamline the process. So:

1. The Bugzilla administrator creates a flag type called blocking2.0 for bugs
   in your product. It shows up on the Show Bug screen as the text
   blocking2.0 with a drop-down box next to it. The drop-down box
   contains four values: an empty space, `?`, `-`, and `+`.
2. The developer sets the flag to `?`.
3. The manager sees the blocking2.0
   flag with a `?` value.
4. If the manager thinks the feature should go into the product
   before version 2.0 can be released, they set the flag to
   `+`. Otherwise, they set it to `-`.
5. Now, every Bugzilla user who looks at the bug knows whether or
   not the bug needs to be fixed before release of version 2.0.

### 2.3.1.2. About Flags[¶](#about-flags "Link to this heading")

Flags can have four values:

`?`

A user is requesting that a status be set. (Think of it as ‘A question is being asked’.)

`-`

The status has been set negatively. (The question has been answered `no`.)

`+`

The status has been set positively.
(The question has been answered `yes`.)

`_`

`unset` actually shows up as a blank space. This just means that nobody
has expressed an opinion (or asked someone else to express an opinion)
about the matter covered by this flag.

### 2.3.1.3. Flag Requests[¶](#flag-requests "Link to this heading")

If a flag has been defined as requestable, and a user has enough
privileges to request it (see below), the user can set the flag’s status to
`?`. This status indicates that someone (a.k.a. “the requester”) is asking
someone else to set the flag to either `+` or `-`.

If a flag has been defined as specifically requestable,
a text box will appear next to the flag into which the requester may
enter a Bugzilla username. That named person (a.k.a. “the requestee”)
will receive an email notifying them of the request, and pointing them
to the bug/attachment in question.

If a flag has *not* been defined as specifically requestable,
then no such text box will appear. A request to set this flag cannot be made
of any specific individual; these requests are open for anyone to answer. In
Bugzilla this is known as “asking the wind”. A requester may ask the wind on
any flag simply by leaving the text box blank.

### 2.3.1.4. Attachment Flags[¶](#attachment-flags "Link to this heading")

There are two types of flags: bug flags and attachment flags.

Attachment flags are used to ask a question about a specific
attachment on a bug.

Many Bugzilla installations use this to
request that one developer review another
developer’s code before they check it in. They attach the code to
a bug report, and then set a flag on that attachment called
review to
review? reviewer@example.com.
reviewer@example.com is then notified by email that
they have to check out that attachment and approve it or deny it.

For a Bugzilla user, attachment flags show up in three places:

1. On the list of attachments in the Show Bug
   screen, you can see the current state of any flags that
   have been set to `?`, `+`, or `-`. You can see who asked about
   the flag (the requester), and who is being asked (the
   requestee).
2. When you edit an attachment, you can
   see any settable flag, along with any flags that have
   already been set. The Edit Attachment
   screen is where you set flags to `?`, `-`, `+`, or unset them.
3. Requests are listed in the Request Queue, which
   is accessible from the My Requests link (if you are
   logged in) or Requests link (if you are logged out)
   visible on all pages.

### 2.3.1.5. Bug Flags[¶](#bug-flags "Link to this heading")

Bug flags are used to set a status on the bug itself. You can
see Bug Flags in the Show Bug and Requests
screens, as described above.

Only users with enough privileges (see below) may set flags on bugs.
This doesn’t necessarily include the assignee, reporter, or users with the
editbugs permission.

## [About queries](#about-queries)

Every GraphQL schema has a root type for both queries and mutations. The [query type](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Type-System) defines GraphQL operations that retrieve data from the server.

For more information, see [Forming calls with GraphQL](/en/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#about-queries).

Note

For GitHub App requests made with user access tokens, you should use separate queries for issues and pull requests. For example, use the `is:issue` or `is:pull-request` filters and their equivalents. Using the `search` connection to return a combination of issues and pull requests in a single query will result in an empty set of nodes.

# Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax

You can build search queries for the results you want with specialized code qualifiers, regular expressions, and boolean operations.

## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```

  GitHub Enterprise Cloud offers a multi-tenant enterprise SaaS solution on Microsoft Azure, allowing you to choose a regional cloud deployment for data residency, so your in-scope data is stored at rest in a designated location. This is available in the EU with additional regions coming soon. [Contact our sales team](/enterprise/contact/data-residency) to learn more.
* Enterprise Managed Users

  Own and control the user accounts of your enterprise members through your identity provider (IdP).
* User provisioning through SCIM

  Automatically invite members to join your organization when you grant access on your IdP. If you remove a member's access to your GitHub organization on your SAML IdP, the member will be automatically removed from the GitHub organization.
* Enterprise Account to centrally manage multiple organizations

  GitHub Enterprise Cloud includes the option to create an enterprise account, which enables collaboration between multiple organizations, gives administrators a single point of visibility and management and brings license cost savings for identical users in multiple organizations.
* Environment protection rules

  When a workflow job references an environment, the job won't start until all of the environment's protection rules pass.
* Repository rules

  Enforce branch and tag restrictions across your organization, ensuring branch and tag protection across your repositories. Evaluate rules to asses impact before enforcement.
* Audit Log API

  As a GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization administrator, you can now access log events using our GraphQL API and monitor the activity in your organization.
* SOC1, SOC2, type 2 reports annually

  GitHub offers AICPA System and Organization Controls (SOC) 1 Type 2 and SOC 2 Type 2 reports with IAASB International Standards on Assurance Engagements, ISAE 3000, and ISAE 3402.
* FedRAMP Tailored Authority to Operate (ATO)

  Government users can host projects on GitHub Enterprise Cloud with the confidence that our platform meets the low impact software-as-a-service (SaaS) baseline of security standards set by our U.S. federal government partners.
* SAML single sign-on

  Use an identity provider to manage the identities of GitHub users and applications.
* Advanced auditing

  Quickly review the actions performed by members of your organization. Keep copies of audit log data to ensure secure IP and maintain compliance for your organization.
* GitHub Connect

  Share features and workflows between your GitHub Enterprise Server instance and GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

Learn more about GitHub Advanced Security active committers [here](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud%40latest/billing/managing-billing-for-github-advanced-security/about-billing-for-github-advanced-security#about-committer-numbers-for-github-advanced-security)

### GitHub Enterprise Cloud Trial

### What's included in the trial?

You can try GitHub Enterprise for free for 30 days. If you are a new GitHub customer, your trial includes 50 seats. If you need more seats to evaluate GitHub Enterprise Cloud, contact [GitHub's Sales team](https://github.com/enterprise/contact). Learn more and [set up your trial experience](https://docs.github.com/get-started/signing-up-for-github/setting-up-a-trial-of-github-enterprise-cloud).

### Can I skip the trial and start with the paid version of GitHub Enterprise?

Yes, you can sign up directly for a paid GitHub Enterprise plan by going to the billing settings in your account. Read more about [how we bill for enterprise](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud%40latest/billing/managing-billing-for-your-github-account/about-billing-for-your-enterprise).

### How do I add members to the trial organization?

If you are a new GitHub customer, your trial includes 50 seats. If you are an existing GitHub Team customer, your trial is valid for your existing number of seats. If you need more seats to evaluate GitHub Enterprise Cloud, contact [Sales](https://github.com/enterprise/contact).

### How do I add collaborators to the repositories in the organization with the trial?

Anyone with admin access can add outside collaborators to the repository via settings. Step-by-step instructions on adding collaborators to repositories can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository#inviting-a-team-or-person).

### What happens when the trial ends?

If you are a new user your account will be downgraded to a free plan. If you use an existing organization, your plan will be downgraded to the plan you were using before the trial. To purchase GitHub Enterprise or downgrade from within your account, [follow along here](https://docs.github.com/get-started/signing-up-for-github/setting-up-a-trial-of-github-enterprise-cloud#ending-your-trial).

### How do I pay for GitHub Enterprise?

You can pay for GitHub Enterprise with a credit card, PayPal, Azure Subscription ID or request an invoice through the [GitHub Sales team](https://github.com/enterprise/contact). Learn more about [enterprise billing](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server%40latest/billing/managing-billing-for-your-github-account/about-billing-for-your-enterprise).

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

Version Effective Date: December 18, 2024

When you use GitHub, you may be given access to lots of additional products and features ("Additional Products and Features"). Because many of the Additional Products and Features offer different functionality, your Agreement with us (the "Agreement") includes the specific terms for that product or feature combined with your main agreement — the GitHub Terms of Service or GitHub Customer Agreement, or the GitHub Corporate Terms of Service or other legacy GitHub contract, or a Microsoft volume licensing agreement. Below, we've listed those products and features, along with the corresponding additional terms that apply to your use of them.

By using the Additional Products and Features, you also agree to the applicable GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features listed below. A violation of these GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features is a violation of the Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meaning given in the Agreement.

**For Enterprise users**

* **GitHub Enterprise Cloud** users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security, Advisory Database, Codespaces, Dependabot Preview, GitHub Enterprise Importer, Packages, and Pages.
* **GitHub Enterprise Server** users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security, Advisory Database, Connect, Dependabot Preview, GitHub Enterprise Importer, Packages, Pages, and SQL Server Images.

## [Actions](#actions)

GitHub Actions enables you to create custom software development lifecycle workflows directly in your GitHub repository. Actions is billed on a usage basis. The [Actions documentation](/en/actions) includes details, including compute and storage quantities (depending on your Account plan), and how to monitor your Actions minutes usage and set usage limits.

Actions and any elements of the Actions product or service may not be used in violation of the Agreement, the [GitHub Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies), or the GitHub Actions service limitations set forth in the [Actions documentation](/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration). Additionally, regardless of whether an Action is using self-hosted runners, Actions should not be used for:

* Cryptomining;
* Disrupting, gaining, or attempting to gain unauthorized access to, any service, device, data, account, or network (other than those authorized by the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com));
* The provision of a stand-alone or integrated application or service offering the Actions product or service, or any elements of the Actions product or service, for commercial purposes;
* Any activity that places a burden on our servers, where that burden is disproportionate to the benefits provided to users (for example, don't use Actions as a content delivery network or as part of a serverless application, but a low benefit Action could be ok if it’s also low burden); or
* If using GitHub-hosted runners, any other activity unrelated to the production, testing, deployment, or publication of the software project associated with the repository where GitHub Actions are used.

In order to prevent violations of these limitations and abuse of GitHub Actions, GitHub may monitor your use of GitHub Actions. Misuse of GitHub Actions may result in termination of jobs, restrictions in your ability to use GitHub Actions, disabling of repositories created to run Actions in a way that violates these Terms, or in some cases, suspension or termination of your GitHub account.

*Use for Development and Testing*

You may only access and use GitHub Actions to develop and test your application(s). Only one licensed user may access a virtual machine provided by Actions at any time.

*Authorized Developer*

You appoint GitHub as your authorized developer with respect to Apple software included in Actions. GitHub is responsible for complying with the terms for any such software included in Actions and will keep confidential any confidential information of Apple accessed as part of Actions.

*Third Party Repository Service Access*

If you grant GitHub access to your third-party repository service account(s), you authorize GitHub to scan the account(s), including the contents of your Public and Private Repositories, for purposes of providing GitHub Actions.

*Self-Hosted Runners on GitHub Actions*

If you use self-hosted runners, you have the ability to turn off automatic updates but GitHub reserves the right to override your choice for critical security updates.

## [Advanced Security](#advanced-security)

GitHub makes extra security features available to customers under an Advanced Security license. These features include code scanning, secret scanning, and dependency review. The [Advanced Security documentation](/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) provides more details.

Advanced Security is licensed on a "Unique Committer" basis. A "Unique Committer" is a licensed user of GitHub Enterprise, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, or GitHub Enterprise Server, who has made a commit in the last 90 days to any repository with any GitHub Advanced Security functionality activated. You must acquire a GitHub Advanced Security User license for each of your Unique Committers. You may only use GitHub Advanced Security on codebases that are developed by or for you. For GitHub Enterprise Cloud users, some Advanced Security features also require the use of GitHub Actions.

For secret scanning with GitHub Advanced Security, when you opt-in to automatic validity checks for partner patterns, exposed third-party tokens may be shared with the relevant partner, in order to provide you with more information about the validity of the token. Not all partners are based in the United States. The [Secret scanning patterns documentation](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/supported-secret-scanning-patterns) provides more details on which partners support the validity check.

## [Advisory Database](#advisory-database)

The GitHub Advisory Database allows you to browse or search for vulnerabilities that affect open source projects on GitHub.

*License Grant to Us*

We need the legal right to submit your contributions to the GitHub Advisory Database into public domain datasets such as the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) and to license the GitHub Advisory Database under open terms for use by security researchers, the open source community, industry, and the public. You agree to release your contributions to the GitHub Advisory Database under the [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

*License to the GitHub Advisory Database*

The GitHub Advisory Database is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The attribution term may be fulfilled by linking to the GitHub Advisory Database at <https://github.com/advisories> or to individual GitHub Advisory Database records used, prefixed by <https://github.com/advisories>.

## [Codespaces](#codespaces)

*Note: The github.dev service, available by pressing . on a repo or navigating directly to github.dev, is governed by GitHub's Beta Terms of service.*

GitHub Codespaces enables you to develop code directly from your browser using the code within your GitHub repository. Codespaces and any elements of the Codespaces service may not be used in violation of the Agreement or the Acceptable Use Policies. Additionally, Codespaces should not be used for:

* Cryptomining;
* Using our servers to disrupt, or to gain or to attempt to gain unauthorized access to any service, device, data, account or network (other than those authorized by the GitHub Bug Bounty program);
* The provision of a stand-alone or integrated application or service offering Codespaces or any elements of Codespaces for commercial purposes;
* Any activity that places a burden on our servers, where that burden is disproportionate to the benefits provided to users (for example, don't use Codespaces as a content delivery network, as part of a serverless application, or to host any kind of production-facing application); or
* Any other activity unrelated to the development or testing of the software project associated with the repository where GitHub Codespaces is initiated.

In order to prevent violations of these limitations and abuse of GitHub Codespaces, GitHub may monitor your use of GitHub Codespaces. Misuse of GitHub Codespaces may result in termination of your access to Codespaces, restrictions in your ability to use GitHub Codespaces, or the disabling of repositories created to run Codespaces in a way that violates these Terms.

Codespaces allows you to load extensions from the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace (“Marketplace Extensions”) for use in your development environment, for example, to process the programming languages that your code is written in. Marketplace Extensions are licensed under their own separate terms of use as noted in the Visual Studio Marketplace, and the terms of use located at <https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-ToU>. GitHub makes no warranties of any kind in relation to Marketplace Extensions and is not liable for actions of third-party authors of Marketplace Extensions that are granted access to Your Content. Codespaces also allows you to load software into your environment through devcontainer features. Such software is provided under the separate terms of use accompanying it. Your use of any third-party applications is at your sole risk.

The generally available version of Codespaces is not currently available for U.S. government customers. U.S. government customers may continue to use the Codespaces Beta Preview under separate terms. See [Beta Preview terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#j-beta-previews).

## [Competitive Benchmarking](#competitive-benchmarking)

If you offer a product or service competitive to any GitHub product or service, by using that GitHub product or service, you agree to and hereby waive any restrictions as to GitHub on competitive use and benchmark testing in the terms governing your competitive product or service. If you do not intend to waive such restrictions in your terms of use, you are not allowed to use that GitHub product or service.

## [Connect](#connect)

With GitHub Connect, you can share certain features and data between your GitHub Enterprise Server deployment and your GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization or enterprise account on GitHub.com. In order to enable GitHub Connect, you must have at least one (1) account on GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub.com, and one (1) licensed deployment of GitHub Enterprise Server. Your use of GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub.com through Connect is governed by the terms under which you license GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub.com. Use of Personal Data is governed by the [GitHub Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

## [GitHub Copilot](#github-copilot)

For GitHub Copilot Business and Copilot Enterprise license holders, your use of GitHub Copilot is governed by the [GitHub Copilot Product Specific Terms](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-copilot-product-specific-terms).

For other GitHub Copilot license holders, your use of GitHub Copilot is governed by the following terms:
To use GitHub Copilot in your code editor, you need to install the GitHub Copilot extension to that editor. To use GitHub Copilot in the CLI (Command Line Interface), you need to install the GitHub Copilot CLI extension. To use GitHub Copilot Chat on GitHub Mobile, you need to install the GitHub Mobile application. To use GitHub Copilot on the GitHub.com, you must access the website.

If you customize GitHub Copilot, to include using a GitHub Copilot Extension (Extension), your use may be subject to the terms of use and privacy policy applicable to the customization.

The code you write using GitHub Copilot is not “Content” under the Agreement until you upload it to GitHub.com. The code, functions, and other output returned to you by GitHub Copilot are called “**Suggestions**.” GitHub does not own Suggestions. You retain ownership of Your Code and you retain responsibility for Suggestions you include in Your Code. It is entirely your decision whether to use Suggestions generated by GitHub Copilot. If you use Suggestions, GitHub strongly recommends that you have reasonable policies and practices in place designed to prevent the use of a Suggestion in a way that may violate the rights of others.

*Acceptable Use*

Your use of GitHub Copilot is subject to the GitHub [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies). For example, you may not prompt GitHub Copilot with content that is unlawful or otherwise prohibited by the GitHub Acceptable Use Policies on GitHub.com. If you choose to "Allow" Copilot to provide [Suggestions matching public code](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/copilot/using-github-copilot/finding-public-code-that-matches-github-copilot-suggestions?tool=vscode), you must comply with cited licenses.

*Data*

GitHub Copilot (i) may collect and process data based on your settings and the specific GitHub Copilot Service you use - this may include Prompts, Suggestions, and code snippets, and (ii) will collect additional usage information through the GitHub Copilot Service you use tied to your Account - this may include Service Usage Information, Website Usage Data, and Feedback Data. Upon your instructions, we may share this data with third-party applications such as those on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) or third-party AI models of your choosing. This may include personal data, as referenced in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement). You can learn more about the collection and use of GitHub Copilot data in the [GitHub Copilot Trust Center](https://resources.github.com/copilot-trust-center/).

For GitHub Copilot Free users, the data collected by GitHub Copilot may be used for AI Model training where permitted and if you allow in your settings.

## [GitHub Enterprise Importer](#github-enterprise-importer)

Importer is a framework for exporting data from other sources to be imported to the GitHub platform. Importer is provided “AS-IS”.

## [npm](#npm)

npm is a software package hosting service that allows you to host your software packages privately or publicly and use packages as dependencies in your projects. npm is the registry of record for the JavaScript ecosystem. The npm public registry is free to use but customers are billed if they want to publish private packages or manage private packages using teams. The [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/) includes details about the limitation of account types and how to manage [private packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-private-packages) and [organizations](https://docs.npmjs.com/organizations). Acceptable use of the npm registry is outlined in the [open-source terms](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/open-source-terms). There are supplementary terms for both the npm [solo](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/solo-plan) and [org](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/orgs-plan) plans. The npm [Terms of Use](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/terms) apply to your use of npm.

## [Packages](#packages)

GitHub Packages is a software package hosting service that allows you to host your software packages privately or publicly and use packages as dependencies in your projects. GitHub Packages is billed on a usage basis. The [Packages documentation](/en/packages/learn-github-packages/introduction-to-github-packages) includes details, including bandwidth and storage quantities (depending on your Account plan), and how to monitor your Packages usage and set usage limits. Packages bandwidth usage is limited by the [GitHub Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies).

## [Pages](#pages)

Each Account comes with access to the [GitHub Pages static hosting service](/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages). GitHub Pages is intended to host static web pages, but primarily as a showcase for personal and organizational projects.

GitHub Pages is not intended for or allowed to be used as a free web hosting service to run your online business, e-commerce site, or any other website that is primarily directed at either facilitating commercial transactions or providing commercial software as a service (SaaS). Some monetization efforts are permitted on Pages, such as donation buttons and crowdfunding links.

*Bandwidth and Usage Limits*

GitHub Pages are subject to some specific bandwidth and usage limits, and may not be appropriate for some high-bandwidth uses. Please see our [GitHub Pages limits](/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) for more information.

*Prohibited Uses*

GitHub Pages may not be used in violation of the Agreement, the GitHub [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies), or the GitHub Pages service limitations set forth in the [Pages documentation](/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#guidelines-for-using-github-pages).

If you have questions about whether your use or intended use falls into these categories, please contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). GitHub reserves the right at all times to reclaim any GitHub subdomain without liability.

*Educational Exercises*

Using GitHub Pages to create a copy of an existing website as a learning exercise is not prohibited. However, you must write the code yourself, the site must not collect any user data, and you must include a prominent disclaimer on the site indicating that the project is not associated with the original and was only created for educational purposes.

## [Previews](#previews)

Previews means software, online services and additional products and features provided for preview, evaluation, demonstration or trial purposes, or pre-release versions of those, such as alpha, beta, or early access. If your Agreement does not include terms and conditions that address Previews, then the following terms apply. GitHub grants a limited right to use a non-production instance of the Preview. Previews are provided “AS-IS”, “WITH ALL FAULTS” and “AS AVAILABLE”. GitHub may change or discontinue Previews at any time without notice. Any information we give you about a private Preview will be considered GitHub’s confidential information. If you choose to provide comments or suggestions about a Preview, we may use that feedback for any purpose without obligation of any kind. GitHub’s maximum liability is limited to direct damages up to US $500. GitHub has no obligation to defend, indemnify, or hold you harmless for claims brought by third parties arising from your use of Previews.

## [Sponsors Program](#sponsors-program)

GitHub Sponsors allows the developer community to financially support the people and organizations who design, build, and maintain the open source projects they depend on, directly on GitHub. In order to become a Sponsored Developer, you must agree to the [GitHub Sponsors Program Additional Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-sponsors-additional-terms).

## [SQL Server Images](#sql-server-images)

You may download Microsoft SQL Server Standard Edition container image for Linux files ("SQL Server Images"). You must uninstall the SQL Server Images when your right to use the Software ends. Microsoft Corporation may disable SQL Server Images at any time.

## [GitHub Models](#github-models)

GitHub Models is a feature that allows you to learn, try, and test artificial intelligence models on GitHub.com. You can access GitHub Models via the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace). Learn more about GitHub Models by visiting [Prototyping with AI models](/en/github-models/prototyping-with-ai-models).

Your use of this feature is subject to the terms of the company hosting the model and the model license.
