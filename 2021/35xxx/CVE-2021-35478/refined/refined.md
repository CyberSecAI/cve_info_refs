  "CVE-2021-35478": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The provided content mentions multiple XSS vulnerabilities fixed in various Nagios products, but does not specifically indicate the root cause for each. However, it implies that these vulnerabilities stem from insufficient input sanitization and output encoding in different parts of the application.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "XSS vulnerabilities",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary script execution within the context of the victim's browser, potentially allowing for session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.",
      "Attack vectors": "Maliciously crafted input via web interface or API calls, or exploitation of vulnerable URL parameters, and stored XSS vulnerabilities via database records.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would typically need to have the ability to inject malicious code into the system, either via user input fields, by exploiting an insecure API or modifying vulnerable parameters in HTTP requests."
    },
   {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The document mentions a security issue with the `manage_services.sh` script, but does not provide details of root cause. The fix for this issue involved ensuring the usage of the `--no-pager` option when calling systemctl",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper usage of `systemctl` which may allow escaping from systemctl pager.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "Unspecified security impact due to the lack of detail for systemctl escaping.",
        "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to potentially execute arbitrary code or cause unexpected system behavior.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would require access to the system with sufficient privileges to execute the vulnerable `manage_services.sh` script."
    },
    {
     "Root cause of vulnerability":"The document mentions multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the application. However, specific root causes are not stated. It is implied that these vulnerabilities stem from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data when constructing SQL queries, especially in the `mib_name` parameter during MIB uploads, and in parameters used by the Bulk Modification Tool.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerabilities.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read or modify arbitrary data within the database, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or denial of service.",
        "Attack vectors": "Attackers inject malicious SQL code into vulnerable parameters.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attackers would need to be able to interact with the vulnerable interfaces or have access to the relevant API."
    },
   {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The document mentions a command injection vulnerability in the installation of components, wizards, and dashlets via the `cmdsubsys` component, but does not explicitly specify the root cause. It is implied that it is caused by inadequate sanitization or validation of user input when executing system commands.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
        "Attack vectors": "An attacker would need to inject malicious commands through an interface using the vulnerable `cmdsubsys` component.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to have some form of access to the system, typically an authenticated user, with sufficient permissions to trigger the vulnerable installation process."
    },
     {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The document mentions file permission vulnerability related to migration and repair scripts and also using wildcards on some backup scripts. It is implied that insecure permissions or lack of input validation on file paths or command execution allows attackers to access or modify system files or execute arbitrary commands.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure file permissions, insecure use of wildcards",
        "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary file access, deletion or modifications and may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
        "Attack vectors": "An attacker would need to exploit the vulnerable scripts by providing malicious input. For example, providing wildcards which were not intended to be passed into a command",
         "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to have access to the system with sufficient privileges to execute or modify the vulnerable backup scripts."
    },
   {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "The document mentions an SSRF vulnerability in the Scheduled Report URL functionality which is caused by improper validation of the target url for reports and scheduled emails.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Server Side Request Forgery.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to force the server to make requests to internal or external resources, potentially exposing sensitive data or performing other malicious actions.",
         "Attack vectors": "Attackers would need to inject malicious URLs that the server would then attempt to load.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would typically need to be able to modify report settings or scheduled reports, which may require authentication."
   },
    {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The document mentions privilege escalation vulnerability via nagvis.conf and via autodiscover_new.php, indicating that specific files had permissions that could be exploited by users to escalate privileges.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Privilege escalation",
        "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation would allow lower privileged users to obtain elevated access to the system.",
        "Attack vectors": "Attackers would need to exploit the vulnerable files to perform actions beyond their original permissions.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need access to the system, typically as a non-root user, with the ability to exploit the vulnerable file permissions."
    },
    {
        "Root cause of vulnerability":"The document mentions an issue with Jinja2 templates in `migrate_core.yml`. This suggests that the vulnerability stems from allowing the use of Jinja2 templates in a configuration file which is not designed to handle them. ",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Template injection vulnerability.",
        "Impact of exploitation":"Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to perform arbitrary code execution or other unintended behaviors by injecting malicious code via the templating language.",
