{
  "CVE-2021-35209": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Proxy Servlet in Zimbra forwards all HTTP request headers and parameters to URLs that match a specific pattern. It also replaces the `Host` header of the outgoing request with the value of the `X-Host` header if it is set, which can be controlled by an attacker. This allows for open redirection when a service uses the host header to create a redirect, which can then be used to perform SSRF attacks.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
       "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker could use this vulnerability to redirect requests to an arbitrary URL, including internal services. This can lead to the leakage of highly sensitive information, such as Google Cloud API tokens or AWS IAM credentials from instances within the cloud infrastructure. It also can be used to escalate the impact into Remote-Code-Execution by utilizing internal services.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted request to the proxy servlet including a malicious x-host header.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Zimbra server and exploit the proxy servlet. This can be achieved by exploiting another vulnerability such as XSS or if the attacker has valid user credentials."
