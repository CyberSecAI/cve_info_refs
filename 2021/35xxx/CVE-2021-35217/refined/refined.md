Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-35217:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of untrusted data within the `WSAsyncExecuteTasks` endpoint of SolarWinds Patch Manager. This means the application doesn't properly validate user-supplied data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious serialized data that, when deserialized, results in code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is the lack of proper input validation, leading to the deserialization of attacker-controlled data. This is a classic vulnerability that can lead to RCE.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can execute code in the context of `NETWORK SERVICE`, which can allow for further privilege escalation within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **Specific Endpoint:** The attack targets the `WSAsyncExecuteTasks` endpoint.
*   **Deserialization Attack:** The attacker sends malicious serialized data to be processed by the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the SolarWinds Patch Manager instance. The specific level of privileges is not mentioned, but it is likely that a lower privileged account would be enough.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the SolarWinds Patch Manager server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to target the `WSAsyncExecuteTasks` endpoint.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Product:** SolarWinds Patch Manager (versions 2020.2.5 and earlier)
*   **Fixed Version:**  Patch Manager 2020.2.6 HF1
*   **CVSS Score:** 8.8 (from ZDI advisory) and 8.9 (from Solarwinds advisory) both indicating a high severity. CVSS vector is  `AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` from ZDI and `CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L` from Solarwinds. The difference is mainly the Access Vector, where the ZDI reports Network (N) and Solarwinds reports Adjacent (A). The scope is also different with ZDI reporting Unchanged (U) and Solarwinds reporting Changed (C).
*   **Reporting Credit:** The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Jangggggg working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-35217 is a critical vulnerability in SolarWinds Patch Manager that allows an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code due to insecure deserialization. The attacker needs to send malicious data to the `WSAsyncExecuteTasks` endpoint.  The impact is high due to the possibility of RCE and privilege escalation.
