Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a session cache corruption issue within the LemonLDAP-NG system, specifically when the Impersonation plugin and REST Session server are enabled, and CSRF tokens are disabled. This corruption can lead to incorrect association of sessions with users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Session Cache Corruption:** The core issue is that the internal cache used for managing sessions is prone to corruption.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** This corruption can lead to situations where an authenticated user's session is overwritten with another user's information.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** Due to the corrupted session, users can gain unauthorized access as another user.
*   **User Impersonation:** Attackers can effectively impersonate other users due to the incorrect session handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to user data due to the ability to impersonate users.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can bypass authentication and gain access to resources as another user
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By impersonating users with higher privileges, an attacker could achieve a higher level of access within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through a series of HTTP POST requests that are sent to the REST Session server while impersonation plugin is enabled and CSRF tokens are disabled. The vulnerability is triggered by sending multiple POST requests to the authentication endpoint, followed by a reload and refresh of the portal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the LemonLDAP-NG server.
*   **Basic Knowledge:**  The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable configuration and the authentication endpoint of the REST Session server.
*   **Configuration Requirement:** The vulnerability can be exploited only if the Impersonation plugin and REST Session server are enabled, while CSRF tokens are disabled in the LemonLDAP-NG configuration.
