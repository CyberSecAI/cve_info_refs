Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35450:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability. This occurs because the Entando Admin Console uses the FreeMarker template engine to render web pages, and it does not properly sanitize or validate user-controlled input when generating the templates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious code into the server-side template rendering process using the FreeMarker framework. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the server.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user input that is used in template rendering, allowing the injection of malicious FreeMarker code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting the Entando Admin Console.
- **Complete System Compromise:** As demonstrated in the proof of concept, attackers can obtain a reverse shell, gaining complete control over the server.
- **Data Breach/Exfiltration:** Once the attacker has control over the server, they could potentially access sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Widget Input:** The vulnerability can be triggered by inserting malicious code within the "help\_desk" widget or other parts of the application that use user-controlled input in template rendering, specifically by injecting FreeMarker directives.
- **Web Interface:** The attack is initiated through the web interface of the Entando Admin Console.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privileges:** The attacker needs high privileges or access to an account with permissions that allow them to interact with the vulnerable components of the application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Entando Admin Console's web interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Entando Admin Console versions <= 6.3.9.
- The issue was fixed in version 6.4.1, which updated the FreeMarker library to a secure version.
- The proof of concept provided demonstrates how an attacker can execute the `uname -a` command and obtain a reverse shell by injecting FreeMarker directives into the help_desk widget, specifically by using the `freemarker.template.utility.Execute` class to execute system commands.
