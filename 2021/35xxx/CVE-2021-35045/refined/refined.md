The provided content describes a vulnerability in ICE Hrm Version 29.0.0.OS, involving a combination of session fixation and reflected cross-site scripting (XSS). This aligns with CVE-2021-35045 which is for ICE Hrm.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   **Session Fixation:** The application allows the session cookie value to be manipulated by an attacker, meaning an attacker can pre-set a session ID and force a user to use it.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS via GET requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Lack of proper session management, allowing session fixation.
*   Missing `SameSite` attribute on session cookies which could prevent external manipulation.
*   Missing `HttpOnly` flag on the session cookie, making it accessible to JavaScript.
*   Reflected XSS vulnerability in the application, exploitable through a GET request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Full account takeover. An attacker can hijack a user's session and gain complete control over the victim's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Session Fixation:** The attacker can set a specific session ID using a malicious link or by directly manipulating the cookie.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with an XSS payload that modifies the victim's session cookie, after that the attacker uses the crafted cookie to login.
*   **Chained Attack:** The attacker leverages session fixation and reflected XSS vulnerabilities together to achieve account takeover, since the XSS payload is used to set the session ID that was previously pre-set by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Ability to craft malicious URLs or web pages.
*   Ability to trick the victim into clicking a link or loading an image/mail message.
*   No privileged access to the target application is required.
