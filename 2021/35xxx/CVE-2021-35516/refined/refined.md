{
  "CVE-2021-35516": {
    "description": "When reading a specially crafted 7Z archive, Compress can be made to allocate large amounts of memory that finally leads to an out of memory error even for very small inputs. This could be used to mount a denial of service attack against services that use Compress' sevenz package.",
    "root_cause": "A specially crafted 7Z archive can cause the Apache Commons Compress library to allocate excessive memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive memory allocation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide the specially crafted 7Z archive.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability is present in Apache Commons Compress versions 1.6 to 1.20. The patch is available in version 1.21 or later. A feature in Compress 1.19 which tries to recover broken 7z archives makes it easier to exploit this vulnerability. The fix disables this recovery code by default and provides users the ability to control memory usage."
