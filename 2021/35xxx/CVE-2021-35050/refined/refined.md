The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities discovered in Fidelis Network and Deception appliances during a red team engagement. One of the vulnerabilities discussed is related to CVE-2021-35050.

**CVE-2021-35050 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insecure credential storage within the Fidelis CommandPost database.
*   **Weakness:** Usernames and passwords are concatenated and then encrypted using a reversible mechanism. The encrypted strings (referred to as UIDs) are stored in the database, which can be decrypted to recover the original credentials.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can use a SQL Injection vulnerability (CVE-2021-35048) to dump the database and then decrypt stored user credentials, gaining access to the CommandPost web application.
*   **Attack Vector:** SQL Injection (CVE-2021-35048) is used to extract the encrypted credentials.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable Fidelis CommandPost web application with SQL injection payloads. Once this is achieved, the attacker is able to gain credentials to the application.
