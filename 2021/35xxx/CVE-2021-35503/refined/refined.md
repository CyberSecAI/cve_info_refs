Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35503:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the header, which is then stored in the application's activity logs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The injected malicious code is stored in the database and executed when an administrator views or archives the activity logs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful XSS attack can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, session hijacking, and potentially lead to further attacks like remote code execution by leveraging other vulnerabilities within the application.
- The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary Javascript code in the context of the administrator's browser session which can be used to perform any actions as the admin user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is an HTTP request to the login page with a malicious `X-Forwarded-For` header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to inject the malicious header.
- The attacker needs to trick or wait for an administrator to access the activity logs, triggering the stored XSS.

**Additional details:**
- The provided exploit chain leverages CVE-2021-35503 to gain initial access and then leverages CVE-2021-35505 to achieve remote code execution.
- The vulnerability can be triggered even when providing incorrect login credentials, as long as the `X-Forwarded-For` header is present.
- The XSS can be used to steal session cookies, gain access to all files, edit files, place the application into maintenance mode or further escalate privileges
- The vulnerability has been fixed in version Filerun 2021.06.27
