Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-35506:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the HTML editor of Filerun, which allows a user to upload HTML files containing malicious JavaScript code. This code is executed when another user views or edits the file using the HTML editor.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied HTML content, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A low-privileged attacker can gain access to all files of all users.
- The attacker could edit files, put the application in maintenance mode affecting availability, or steal user sessions.
- The attacker can further escalate privileges by stealing sessions or triggering other vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-35504 or CVE-2021-35505).

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading a malicious HTML file through the HTML editor.
- Victim interaction: The vulnerability is triggered when a user views or edits the malicious HTML file via the HTML editor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Requires a low-privileged account within the Filerun application.
- The attacker needs to be able to upload files using the HTML editor.
