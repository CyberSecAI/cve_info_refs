Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-35377

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and escaping of parameters in `KHOMP_admin.php`, `vicidial-grey.php`, and `vicidial.php`. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present in the login and administration portal of the Vicidial application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows an attacker to inject JavaScript code. This code can be used to:
    - Manipulate the page content.
    - Expose cookie values.
    - Potentially carry out other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted URLs or requests that include malicious JavaScript code in the vulnerable parameters of `KHOMP_admin.php`, `vicidial-grey.php` and `vicidial.php`. When a user clicks on such a link or submits a manipulated request, the injected code is executed by the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need prior access to the system to carry out this attack.
-  An attacker needs to trick a user (e.g. an administrator) into clicking a malicious link or visiting a specially crafted website containing the malicious request.
