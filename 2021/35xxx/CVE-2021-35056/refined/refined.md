The provided content is related to CVE-2021-35056.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Unisys Stealth installation routine creates a scheduled task in the Windows Task Scheduler that contains an executable. The vulnerability arises because this setup allows for the possibility of an unintended executable being run instead of the intended Unisys Stealth executable associated with the scheduled task.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unspecified executable path leading to potential execution of a malicious executable.
- Improperly secured scheduled task configuration.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-428, which indicates an "Uncontrolled Search Path Element" issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could replace the intended executable with a malicious one.
- This malicious executable could interfere with normal endpoint operations.
- The impact is rated as MEDIUM.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the affected Windows endpoint is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs high privileges on the local machine to modify the scheduled task and replace the executable. This aligns with the CVSS vector "PR:H".
