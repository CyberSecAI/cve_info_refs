# CVE-2021-35342 - useradm incorrect access control vulnerability

We recently discovered a vulnerability in Mender Enterprise, thanks to the security researcher Mubassir Kamdar, and we have now fixed it.

When the User Administration service was configured to cache the user's JWT token verification, the token wasn't fully invalidated on log out, making it possible to issue new API calls to the backend despite being logged out. The security issue affects Mender Enterprise 2.6.0 and 2.7.0, and we fixed it in Mender Enterprise 2.6.1 and 2.7.1. Open-source versions of Mender are not affected, as they do not include the caching features.

The security of the Mender product and our users is something we take very seriously. We will continue to look for, fix and responsibly disclose serious weaknesses in our product(s).

In the official public CVE registry, the issue's ID is [CVE-2021-35342](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-35342). If you have any questions or concerns, please get in touch with the Mender support if you have a support contract or email security@northern.tech.
