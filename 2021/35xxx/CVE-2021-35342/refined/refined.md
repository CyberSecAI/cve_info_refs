Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-35342:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incomplete invalidation of JWT tokens when a user logs out from Mender Enterprise. When the User Administration service is configured to cache JWT token verifications, logging out does not fully invalidate the cached token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incomplete Session Termination:** The primary weakness is the failure to fully invalidate cached JWT tokens upon user logout. This leaves a valid token that can still be used for authentication.
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The cached token allows unauthorized access to the backend, despite the user having logged out. This bypasses the intended access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized API Access:** An attacker with a previously valid (but now logged-out) user's token can make API calls to the backend as that user. This can allow them to view, modify, or delete resources, depending on the permissions of the logged out user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the logged out user had elevated privileges, the attacker could exploit those elevated privileges.
- **Data Breach:** Depending on API access, sensitive data could be exfiltrated by an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Token Replay:** The attacker needs a valid JWT token before the user logs out. This token is then replayed after the user logs out.
- **Network Interception (Potential):** While not explicitly stated, if the attacker could intercept a token they could also replay it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Prior Access:** The attacker needs to have been logged in as a user of the Mender Enterprise system to obtain a valid JWT token.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Mender backend to replay the token and make API calls.

**Affected Versions:**
Mender Enterprise 2.6.0 and 2.7.0

**Fixed Versions:**
Mender Enterprise 2.6.1 and 2.7.1

**Additional Notes:**
- Open-source versions of Mender are not affected, as they do not include the caching feature.
- The fix fully invalidates JWT tokens on logout.
