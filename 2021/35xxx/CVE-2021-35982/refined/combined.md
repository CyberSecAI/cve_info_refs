## Your Risk Posture

## Visualized. Prioritized. Automated

# Visibility isn’t just about gathering all the data – it’s about making sense of it.

Effective vulnerability management teams require **contextual awareness** to make informed decisions. Our platform automates the next steps by analyzing realistic attack paths to
**prioritize what really matters**.

## What will you discover when DeepSurface connects the dots?

* [Blast Radius Insights](#section-iconbox-0-c33f18a)
* + No asset or user account is an island. Connect the dots between CVEs, access rights, and your most sensitive assets.
  + Thousands of assets may be affected by a CVE, but not all assets are created equal. Quickly determine the downstream impact of an exploit in a specific part of your environment.
  + Clearly demonstrate to stakeholders and system owners how their choices are presenting risk to the organization as a whole.

## Case Studies

## The DeepSurface Approach

“We all know we need to patch, but not everyone sees how it lowers risk. That's where DeepSurface shines – not just showing us the effectiveness of the program, but giving us something tangible that proves how we’re managing risk.”
Zac StreelmanCTO at REV Federal Credit Union

“While building out our vulnerability management program to future proof our processes and tools, Chris Sherman (VP, Information Security, TPRM, Data Governance) presented the solution to our team and we knew right away that DeepSurface was a game changer.”
Troy HenleySr. InfoSec Lead at Sutton Bank

“DeepSurface’s ability to cut through the data to provide real information to attack vulnerability management helped us win a major support contract and saved us 12 months by prioritizing the actual security threats.”
Craig TerrellPartner with ProStratus
