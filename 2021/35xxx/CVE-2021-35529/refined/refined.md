- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficiently Protected Credentials. The application stores database credentials in a way that is accessible to an attacker who has gained access to an authorized user's computer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Credentials for the database are not sufficiently protected.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to a user's computer can retrieve database credentials, gaining the ability to read or edit application data, and shut down the product.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs access to an authorized user's computer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have already gained access to an authorized user's computer to exploit the vulnerability. The attack vector is remote.
