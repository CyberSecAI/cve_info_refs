The provided content is related to CVE-2021-35283, as it describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `product_Admin.php` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the direct inclusion of user-supplied data within an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the `$_POST['Name']`, `$_POST['Fname']`, and `$_POST['ID']` variables are directly inserted into the `INSERT` SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious user can inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating the `Name`, `Fname`, and `ID` parameters in the POST request. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, and potentially compromise the entire database. The provided example shows how to inject a SQL function call using `Name=aa',version(),4)#` which will return the version of the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `product_Admin.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server where `product_Admin.php` is located. No special privileges are required. The attacker also needs knowledge of the application structure.
