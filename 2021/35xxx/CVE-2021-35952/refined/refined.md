{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Lack of Bluetooth LE pairing and access control.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The Fastrack Reflex 2.0 Activity Tracker does not properly implement Bluetooth LE pairing and access controls. Specifically, the characteristic at handle 0x0017, which is responsible for setting the time, date, and month, can be modified without authentication or authorization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can change the time, date, and month on the smartwatch.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through Bluetooth LE. An attacker in range can connect to the device and modify the time/date/month characteristic.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the device and have the ability to send Bluetooth LE commands."
