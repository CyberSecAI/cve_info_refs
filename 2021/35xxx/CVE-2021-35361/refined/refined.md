The provided content describes a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the dotCMS Docker image `dotcms/dotcms:21.05.1`.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the `SEARCH` parameter within the `dotAdmin/#/c/containers` and `dotAdmin/#/c/links` URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to:
    - Transmitting private data like cookies or session information to the attacker.
    - Redirecting the victim to attacker-controlled web content.
    - Performing other malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with a specially crafted `SEARCH` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to convince a logged-in admin user to click the malicious link or otherwise load the malicious URL in their browser while logged in to the dotCMS admin panel.
