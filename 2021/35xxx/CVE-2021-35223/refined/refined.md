Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-35223:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the abuse of the FTP command `SITE EXEC`. This command, intended for executing commands on the server, can be used to obfuscate malicious payloads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The `SITE EXEC` command allows for the execution of arbitrary commands on the server, when it should have more restricted usage.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability is present because there's no proper sanitization or filtering of the commands being passed to the `SITE EXEC` command, which leads to the possibility of Remote Code Execution via command injection.
- **Command Obfuscation:** The `SITE EXEC` command can be used to hide or obscure the malicious payload, making it more difficult to detect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable Serv-U server.
- **Full Compromise:** The attacker could gain complete control over the server, leading to data theft, system disruption, and further attacks on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network connection (likely FTP).
- **FTP Protocol:** The vulnerability is triggered through the FTP `SITE EXEC` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable Serv-U server.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account to log in to the FTP service.
- **FTP Client:** The attacker will require an FTP client capable of sending FTP commands, including the `SITE EXEC` command.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as High severity with a CVSS score of 8.5
- Serv-U versions 15.2.3 and earlier are affected.
- Serv-U version 15.2.4 addresses this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Exodus Intelligence.
- A workaround exists, which is provided through a link in the advisory.
