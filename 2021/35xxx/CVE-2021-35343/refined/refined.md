- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of CSRF protection in the `/op/op.Ajax.php` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can trick an authenticated user into performing actions they did not intend, such as editing document names, without the victim's knowledge. This is achieved by enticing a logged-in user to visit a malicious webpage controlled by the attacker.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is carried out through a malicious web page controlled by the attacker. The victim, while logged into SeedDMS, is tricked into visiting this page, which sends a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage and lure a SeedDMS user who is already authenticated to visit it. The attacker does not need direct access to the SeedDMS server. The user must be logged in to SeedDMS during the attack.
