- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the permission check for file drop functionality (upload-only shares). The `shareinfo` API could be used to bypass the intended permission checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper protection of alternate path (CWE-424). The `shareinfo` API did not enforce the upload-only restrictions of file drops.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could use the `shareinfo` API to view the names of files within a file drop (upload-only share), which is not the intended behavior of upload-only shares, but does not allow downloading the files.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access, specifically using the `shareinfo` API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must have a valid user account and needs to be able to access the `shareinfo` API. The attacker must have knowledge of the existence of a file drop.
