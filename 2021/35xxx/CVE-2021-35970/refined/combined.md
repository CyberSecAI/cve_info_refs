### **[okybr](/okybr)** commented [Jun 28, 2021](#issue-931320137)

| I already contacted some maintainers privately about this, but they did not respond. That's why I'm now making this public.  In Talk version 4, it is very easy to query the e-mail addresses of users without any authentication; thus, possibly revealing their true identities behind their pseudonyms.  This is possible although the documentation states:  The primary email address of the user. Only accessible to Administrators or the current user.  But in order to find out the e-mail address of a user, you can e.g. simply send a `query Q1 { user(id: "XXXX") { email }}` GraphQL-query to the GraphQL-endpoint of the talk-server ­-- without any authentication. You can also query all e-mail addresses with `query Q2 { users(query: {}) { nodes { email }}`.  I demand the maintainers ([@wyattjoh](https://github.com/wyattjoh) , [@cvle](https://github.com/cvle), [@kgardnr](https://github.com/kgardnr)) to merge [the pull-request](https://github.com/coralproject/talk/pull/3599) as soon as possible, and release version 4.13.0 in the version-4-branch. |

Talk version 4 exposes private information such as e-mail addresses to unauthenticated queries because of a simple bug. This pull-request fixes the bug and thus closes the e-mail leak.

Sorry, something went wrong.
