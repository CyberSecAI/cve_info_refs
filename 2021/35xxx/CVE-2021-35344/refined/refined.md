Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2021-35344:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `BitStreamReader::getCurVal` function, which is triggered when processing a malformed HEVC stream with a Supplemental Enhancement Information (SEI) payload where the declared `payloadSize` exceeds the actual bits remaining in the bitstream.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The vulnerability lies in reading beyond the allocated buffer in `BitStreamReader::getCurVal` when handling an SEI message. Specifically, the `payloadSize` field within the SEI message dictates how much data should be read, but this size isn't adequately checked against the remaining data in the buffer.
- **Insufficient Bounds Checking:** The code does not properly validate if the number of bits requested to be read from the bitstream is within the valid bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The primary impact of exploitation is a crash due to the heap-buffer-overflow, as evidenced by the AddressSanitizer (ASan) output.
- **Potential Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, heap-based overflows can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker can carefully craft the malformed input.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious HEVC Stream:** The attacker provides a specially crafted HEVC bitstream with a malformed SEI message, where the `payloadSize` is larger than the remaining bits available in the buffer.
- **File Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted HEVC stream file with the `tsMuxer` application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted HEVC bitstream as input to the `tsMuxer` application. This can be achieved by providing the crafted file through the command line, as shown in the provided PoC execution command: `./tsmuxer getCurVal_3`

**More Detail than CVE:**

The provided information offers significant details beyond a typical CVE description, specifically:
-   **Exact Location:**  The problematic code is located in `bitStream.h:58:61`.
-   **Call Stack:** The complete call stack leading to the vulnerability is available, pinpointing the sequence of function calls responsible.
-   **PoC:** A proof-of-concept input file (`getCurVal_3.zip`) is provided, along with instructions on how to trigger the vulnerability, which allows for verification.
-   **ASan Output:**  The AddressSanitizer output provides low-level memory access details, demonstrating the exact location of the overflow and associated memory layout.
- **Fix Details:** The commit `3a889a37b5b74a45025aca13ebda394b8f706ef3` shows how the vulnerability was addressed by adding a check to ensure `m_reader.getBitsLeft()` is greater than or equal to the calculated `payloadSize * 8`.
