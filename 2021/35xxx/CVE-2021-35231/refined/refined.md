- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unquoted service path vulnerability exists in the Kiwi Syslog Server Installation Wizard. Specifically, the path to the application executable within the service configuration was not enclosed in quotes.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unquoted service path. The `Application` path in the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\Kiwi Syslog Server\Parameters` is not enclosed in quotes.

- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker could gain escalated privileges by inserting a malicious executable into a directory within the unquoted service path. When the service starts, it may execute the attacker's malicious code instead of the intended executable.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have local access to the system to modify the directory structure and insert a malicious executable.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires local access with the ability to create directories and files, and high privileges to write to the service's registry key. They need to insert a malicious executable into a location within the unquoted path which will be executed when the service is started.
