Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to invalidate user sessions in Pingdom upon a password or email address change.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Management Flaw:** User sessions are not terminated when a user's password or email address is modified. This means that existing sessions remain active even after credentials have been changed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially maintain access to a user's account through an existing session even after the user has changed their password or email address. This could lead to unauthorized access to monitoring data or other Pingdom resources.
*   **Data Breach Risk:** If an attacker gains access they could potentially exfiltrate sensitive data or modify monitoring configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Multiple Active Sessions:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user has multiple active sessions in separate browser windows.
*   **Credential Change:** The vulnerability is exposed when a user changes their password or email address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Existing Valid Session:** The attacker must already have an active session on the Pingdom platform. This could be achieved through previous compromise of a user's account or through another vulnerability.
*   **No Specific Network Location:** The attacker could be anywhere on the internet if they have an active user session.

**Additional Notes**
* The CVSS score is 4.8/Medium with a vector string of CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N which implies Physical attack vector and a difficult attack complexity with no privileges required and user interaction required, scope changed, with high confidentiality impact and no integrity or availability impact.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Pingdom as of September 13, 2021.
*   The vulnerability was acknowledged to be found by Taseer Hussain
