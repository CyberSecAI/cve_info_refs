- **Root cause of vulnerability**: In certain circumstances, the email address of an Agent was shown to a Customer instead of the email address of the current group the Ticket is in. This occurred when communicating via different incoming and outgoing channels where each message is displayed as an article with attributes according to the channel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of email addresses associated with different communication channels. Specifically, the agent's email address was incorrectly exposed to customers when it should have displayed the group's email address.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact of this vulnerability is the disclosure of an agent's email address to a customer. This could potentially lead to privacy concerns, targeted attacks against the agent, or other forms of unauthorized contact.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered during normal communication between agents and customers within the Zammad system. It occurs when displaying article attributes of messages from different channels.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No specific attacker capabilities are needed beyond being a normal customer interacting with the system. The vulnerability is triggered by a normal interaction between a customer and an agent through the helpdesk system.
