- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `Form_Login` function in the TOTOLINK A720R router firmware contains a login bypass vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `getNthValueSafe` function loops through URL parameters. If a parameter named `authCode` is present and its value is `1`, a critical authentication check is bypassed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can bypass the login authentication and gain access to the admin page without needing the correct password.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to the `/formLoginAuth.htm` endpoint. The request must contain the `authCode=1` parameter along with a `userName` parameter (e.g., `userName=admin`)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This usually means being on the same network or having network access to the device.
