  "CVE-2021-35938": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "RPM uses path-based operations to set permissions and credentials after file installation. If an unprivileged user owns the directory where this occurs, they can replace the file with a symbolic link to a critical system file, thus escalating privileges.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition",
      "Symlink attack"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local unprivileged user can escalate privileges to root, potentially compromising data confidentiality, integrity, and system availability.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access to the system"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local unprivileged user who can manipulate files and directories in a location where RPM performs installation operations."
