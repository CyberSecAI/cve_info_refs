## New features and improvements

### TLS 1.3 support introduced

Crypto library OpenSSL has been upgraded to version 3.0.2 in Serv-U File Server 15.3.1. As part of this update, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0 and SSLv3 protocols have been deprecated and TLS 1.3 has been introduced.

### Log Zipped Download option

Serv-U File Server 15.3.1 introduces an option to log messages pertaining to zipped folder or multiple file downloads.

To enable this go to [Domain Activities Settings](../help-configure-logs.htm), User Properties - Logging or Group Properties - Logging, depending on the level at which you want apply this option, and check or uncheck the Zipped Downloads checkbox. When enabled, messages related to the download of a folder or multiple files are logged to the logfile and screen (the bottom pane of the [Serv-U Management Console](../servu-management-console.htm)).

Folders or multiple files are downloaded as ZippedDownload.zip

### Zipped Download events

The MFT version of Serv-U File Server 15.3.1 introduces two new events: Zipped File Download and Zipped File Download Failed. These can be used in same way as existing event types to trigger event actions such as email notifications, balloon tip alerts or posts to the Windows Event Log or Microsoft Message Queue (MSMQ).

For information on creating events, see [Global Properties: Events](../help-events.htm), [Domain Properties: Events](../servu-domain-details-events.htm), [Group Properties: Events](../servu-group-events.htm) or [User Properties: Events](../servu-user-events.htm).

Serv-U File Server 15.3.1 also includes the additional upgrades, fixes and improvements:

* Serv-U generates a unique default certificate during installation in the Windows Certificate store
* New Serv-U Client applies configuration from limits and settings in management console
* Custom logo option for new Serv-U client
* Improvements for login page with custom html/css
* Language selection on login page has been fixed
* Authentication fix for configuration behind load balancer
* New variable $FileShareToken introduced that can be used in download/upload events
* Removal of DSA 2048 and 4096 SSH private keys

---

## Upgrade notes

### Licensing

The Serv-U licensing framework has been updated since Serv-U 15.2.3 and a new license key now needs to be used to activate this product version.

If your Serv-U product maintenance is active, you can find your new license key generated on customer portal. Use this new license key to activate Serv-U after installation. SolarWinds strongly recommend that you upgrade to this version with the new licensing framework as older framework will not be supported in the future.

### Password security

If you are upgrading from version 15.1.7 or older, increased password security and automatically converts existing MD5 passwords using a more secure algorithm when users connect for the first time after upgrade.

If an account is not used within 90 days of the upgrade, access will be restricted and the user will not be able to log in afterward. The administrator will be required to change their password.

## SolarWinds CVEs

SolarWinds would like to thank our Security Researchers below for reporting on this issue in a responsible manner and working with our security, product, and engineering teams to fix the vulnerability.

| CVE-ID | Vulnerability Title | Description | Severity | Credit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2021-35249 | Domain Admin Broken Access Control | "This broken access control vulnerability pertains specifically to a domain admin who can access configuration & user data of other domains that they should not have access to. Please note the admin is unable to modify the data (read only operation). This UAC issue leads to a data leak to unauthorized users for a domain, with no log of them accessing the data unless they attempt to modify it. This read only activity is logged to the original domain and does not specify which domain was accessed." | Medium | N/A |

Deprecated platforms and features are still supported in the current release. However, they will be unsupported in future release. Plan on upgrading deprecated platforms, and avoid using deprecated features. Customizations applied to a deprecated feature might not be migrated if a new feature replaces the deprecated one.

See the [End of Life Policy](http://www.solarwinds.com/end-of-life-policy) for information about SolarWinds product life cycle phases. To see EoL dates for earlier Serv-U versions, see Serv-U [release history](release_history.htm).
