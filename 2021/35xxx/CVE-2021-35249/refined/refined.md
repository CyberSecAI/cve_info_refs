Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35249:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a broken access control issue within SolarWinds Serv-U. Specifically, a domain administrator has the ability to access configuration and user data belonging to other domains.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** A domain administrator role has excessive permissions that allow unauthorized access to data from other domains.
- **Data Leakage:** The vulnerability results in a data leak of configuration and user data.
- **Insufficient Logging:** Read-only access to the data is not explicitly logged, making it difficult to detect unauthorized access. The read activity is only logged to the original domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker can potentially obtain sensitive configuration and user information from other domains.
- **Data Leakage:** Sensitive information could be exposed, potentially leading to further attacks or breaches.
- **Limited Accountability:** Due to insufficient logging, it is difficult to trace unauthorized data access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Serv-U management interface using domain admin credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid domain administrator credentials for one of the domains.
- The attacker requires network access to the Serv-U server.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes the official fix version (Serv-U 15.3.1)
- The content specifies that the unauthorized access is read-only, meaning the attacker cannot modify the data.
- The issue is classified as a "Medium" severity vulnerability.
- The content also provides the CVSS v3.1 score and vector.
