Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-35216:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data at the `EditResourceControls` endpoint in SolarWinds Patch Manager. This lack of validation allows for the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The primary vulnerability is the deserialization of untrusted data. This occurs when the application takes serialized data (which could be controlled by the attacker) and converts it back into program objects without sufficient checks.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `EditResourceControls` endpoint does not properly validate user-supplied data, allowing malicious serialized data to be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The code execution occurs in the context of the `NETWORK SERVICE` account, which has elevated privileges.
*   **System Compromise:** The vulnerability can lead to complete compromise of the server hosting the affected SolarWinds Patch Manager instance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the SolarWinds Patch Manager server via HTTP.
*   **Authenticated Attack:** The attacker must be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability at the `EditResourceControls` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs valid credentials to access the SolarWinds Patch Manager instance.
*   The attacker must have network connectivity to the affected server.
*   The attacker requires knowledge of Orion Platform addresses to send the malicious link with the payload.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Jangggggg working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   SolarWinds has released a patch (Patch Manager 2020.2.6) to address this issue.
*   The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS score of 8.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) by ZDI and 8.9 (CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L) by SolarWinds.
*   The vulnerability exists in the Patch Manager Orion Platform Integration module.
