- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Buffer overflow in dbfview.exe when processing a crafted DBF file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present in Scalabium dBase Viewer version 2.6 (Build 5.751).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution. By exploiting the buffer overflow, an attacker can overwrite the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) records and redirect execution to attacker-controlled code.
- **Attack vectors**: A crafted DBF file is used as the attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious DBF file to the vulnerable application.
