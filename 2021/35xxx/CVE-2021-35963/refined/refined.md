Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-35963:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the Orca HCM digital learning platform. The platform's upload function does not properly filter file formats.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper file format validation during the upload process. This allows attackers to upload files of any type, including those with malicious script content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading files containing malicious scripts, attackers can achieve remote code execution on the hosting machine, potentially gaining complete control over the server.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the hosting machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through the platform's upload functionality.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited without needing to log in to the platform.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable platform's upload functionality through a network.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must know about the vulnerability and its location in order to exploit it.
*  **Malicious File Creation**: The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious file containing a script.
