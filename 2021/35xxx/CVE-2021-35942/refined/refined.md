{
  "CVE-2021-35942": {
    "description": "The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.",
    "root_cause": "The `wordexp` function used `atoi` instead of `strtoul` to convert a string to an integer. `atoi` does not detect overflow, which can lead to incorrect calculations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Use of `atoi` instead of `strtoul`"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (crash) or arbitrary memory read, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Calling the `wordexp` function with a crafted, untrusted string containing a very large number in the format `${number}`."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted string to the `wordexp` function.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability is in the `parse_param` function inside `posix/wordexp.c`. The fix involves using `strtoul` instead of `atoi` to handle overflows in positional parameter numbers."
