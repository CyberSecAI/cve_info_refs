        "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed in the context of other users' browsers, potentially allowing them to steal session tokens or cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect the user to malicious sites.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the login page, specifically the username input field.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to input text into the username field on the login page and have another user trigger the code through the application.",
