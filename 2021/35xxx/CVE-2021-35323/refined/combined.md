| Describe your problem I found a cross-site scripting attack on the login page <http://localhost:800/admin/login> cross-site scripting is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send malicious code(usually in javascript form) to another user Because a browser cannot know if the script should be trusted or not, it will execute the script in user context allowing the attacker to access any cookies or sessions tokens retained by the browser. Steps to reproduce the problem  1. open login page <http://localhost:800/admin/login>; 2. enter the username place `admin"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` and enter password 3. trigger the malicious javascript code  Bludit version bludit-3-13-1 PHP version PHP 7.4.15 |

| I can confirm the security problem on my install. Thanks for the heads up!  A quick and dirty fix is to add: `$username = strip_tags($_POST['username']);` to `/bl-kernel/admin/views/login.php`  and then use `$username` in place of `$_POST['username']`. |
