Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35067:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Meross Smart Wi-Fi Garage Door Opener and potentially other Meross devices, accept signed JSON payloads to trigger actions. The vulnerability stems from the lack of replay protection for these signed messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **No Replay Attack Protection:** The device does not verify if a signed message is new or if it has been previously used. The device accepts replayed messages, regardless of their timestamp, as long as the signature is valid.
2. **Incomplete Payload Signing:** Only the header of the JSON message is signed, while the payload is not. This allows an attacker to modify the payload, such as changing the "open" field to "close" or vice versa, without invalidating the signature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can:
* Capture a legitimate signed message (e.g. to close the garage door) and replay it at any time to trigger the same action (close the garage door).
* Modify a captured message (e.g. changing "close" to "open" in the payload) and replay it, causing the device to perform an unintended action.
* By capturing the messages over time, an attacker could later replay them to open garage doors.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Local Network Traffic Capture:** An attacker on the same local network as the Meross device can intercept communication between the mobile app and the device.
2. **MQTT Server (Initially):** Although later fixed, initially, an attacker could connect to the central Meross MQTT server and subscribe to other users' topics to obtain signed messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Local Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Meross device to capture HTTP traffic.
2. **(Initially) Meross Account Credentials:** In order to access the MQTT server, an attacker needs to get a Meross user ID and the associated secret key. These can be obtained by creating a Meross account and setting up a device.
3. **(Initially) Ability to Connect to MQTT Server:** The attacker needed to be able to connect to the MQTT server and subscribe to relevant topics before the MQTT server vulnerability was fixed.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was confirmed to be fixed in firmware version 3.2.3.
*   The vulnerability affects not only the garage door opener but also other Meross devices.
*   The MQTT vulnerability was fixed by Meross before the replay vulnerability.
