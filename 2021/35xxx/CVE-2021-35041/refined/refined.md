- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The node's P2P message decoding logic does not handle malformed packets correctly, leading to a recursive call of the `doRead` function and memory exhaustion. Specifically, when a packet with an invalid length is received, the `decode` function returns 0 (`PACKET_INCOMPLETE`). This causes the `doRead` function to call itself again, without releasing any resources, leading to an infinite loop and unsustainable memory consumption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of malformed P2P packets, specifically packets with an incorrect length field, leads to a denial-of-service vulnerability due to uncontrolled memory consumption and recursive function calls.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious node can send specially crafted packets to a vulnerable node, causing the target node to consume excessive memory and eventually crash. This can lead to denial of service for the target node and disrupt the network.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious peer on the P2P network sends continuously malformed packets to the target node. The malformed packet contains a large value for the message length field, while the actual packet is short.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a peer connected to the target node's P2P network, and must be able to send network packets to the target node.
