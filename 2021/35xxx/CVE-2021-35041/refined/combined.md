### **[fCorleone](/fCorleone)** commented [Jun 15, 2021](#issue-921324656)

| **Describe the bug** A malicious node can send a packet continuously. The packet is in an incorrect format and cannot be decoded by the node correctly. As a result, the node may consume the memory sustainably, as the flowing figure shows: [Figure_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22519865/122045385-3cd01300-ce10-11eb-8536-32316b9009a6.png) After 100 seconds, over 4000 MB memory has been consumed. If I continue sending the packet, the node will consume all the memory. At last it be killed by the OS.  In order to analyze the reason for this bug, I try to debug the code of the node. Here is what I found: First, I found that in the file `libp2p/P2PMessageRC2.cpp`, at line 109 in the function `decode`:  ``` ssize_t P2PMessageRC2::decode(const byte* buffer, size_t size) {     ...     m_length = ntohl(*((uint32_t*)&buffer[offset]));     if (size < m_length)    {                return dev::network::PACKET_INCOMPLETE;         }     ... } ```  the variable `size` is 72 and the variable `m_length` is a very big number under my packet. So the function will return `dev::network::PACKET_INCOMPLETE` whose value is 0. The variable which accepts the return value is `result` in `libnetwork/Session.cpp` at line 421 in the function `doRead`:  ``` ssize_t result = message->decode(s->m_data.data(), s->m_data.size()); ```  and the program will enter into a if-else cluse:  ``` if (result > 0){     ... } else if (result == 0)  {                             s->doRead();                             break;                     } else {     ... } ```  Because the value of `result` is 0, so here the program will call the function `doRead` recursively. If I delete this call, the problem will not occur anymore.  ``` else if (result == 0)  {                             // s->doRead();                             break;                     } ```  So I think the reason maybe the developers forget to release certain memory before the return statement if the packet is not decoded correctly!  **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior:   1. Construct a P2P packet which claims to have a big length (set a big value for variable `m_length`) 2. Continuously send the packet to a running node 3. The node will consume the memory continuously and crash.   **Expected behavior** By handling the abnormal packets correctly, the memory cost will not sustainably increase and the node will not crash.  **Screenshots** I have give the screenshots of the memory usage of the node in the description part.  **Environment (please complete the following information):**   * OS: Ubuntu 16.04 * FISCO BCOS Version: v2.7.2   **Additional context** None! |
