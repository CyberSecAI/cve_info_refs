- **Root cause of vulnerability:** RealPort encryption mode is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper encryption mechanisms which allows a man-in-the-middle attack to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged during a session.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful man-in-the-middle attack allows the attacker to intercept and potentially manipulate communication, leading to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker positioned in the network to intercept communications between a client and a vulnerable RealPort service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned within the network to intercept traffic between the client and the vulnerable service. The attacker also needs the capability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Additional information:** The vulnerability is partially fixed in RealPort software 4.10.490 for Windows and 1.9-41 for Linux by adding certificate pinning.
