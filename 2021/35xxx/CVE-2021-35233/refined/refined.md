Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35233:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The HTTP `TRACK` and `TRACE` methods were enabled in the affected versions of Kiwi Syslog Server. These methods are intended for diagnostic purposes only.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unnecessary HTTP Methods Enabled:** The presence of `TRACK` and `TRACE` methods which echo back the request received by the server to the client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. Specifically, internal authentication headers appended by reverse proxies may be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** An attacker can send specially crafted HTTP requests using the `TRACK` or `TRACE` methods to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Kiwi Syslog Server. This suggests network access is required, but no specific privileges or authentication is mentioned in this document. The CVSS score indicates an attack vector of "Network" (AV:N), requiring no privileges (PR:N), no user interaction (UI:N).

**Summary**
The vulnerability is due to the exposure of the HTTP TRACK and TRACE methods in Kiwi Syslog Server. These methods can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information due to the echoing back of request headers. This is a medium severity issue.
