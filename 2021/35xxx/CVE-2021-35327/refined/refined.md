- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The TOTOLINK A720R router has a vulnerability where the telnet service can be started without any prior authorization, and it uses a default username and password combination.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unsafe telnet settings: The telnet service is enabled by default.
    - Missing authorization: Telnet service can be started without authentication
    - Default credentials: The router uses a hardcoded username and password (`root:cs2012`) for telnet access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can gain shell access to the router by enabling the telnet service without authorization and then using the default credentials. This allows attackers to fully compromise the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a POST request to the router to enable the telnet service, then connecting to the telnet service with the default credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface and also have network connectivity to the router to access the telnet service. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to enable the telnet service.
