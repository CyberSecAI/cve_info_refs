Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-35525:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `fread()/fwrite()` logic in the PostSRSd subprocess could be confused by overly long input lines, causing it to hang. This occurs because Postfix sometimes sends malformed requests with multiple concatenated email addresses, which the `fgets` function in `postsrsd.c` reads up to the buffer size. This leads to an incomplete read where the buffer is filled and the rest of the input remains in the stream, leading to a hang.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary vulnerability is that an overly long input can cause the PostSRSd subprocess to hang indefinitely.
- **Improper Input Handling:** The code did not correctly handle input that was larger than the buffer, causing it to not fully process the input and enter a hung state.
- **Incorrect assumption about Postfix behavior:** It assumed that Postfix would only send valid, short email addresses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful attack results in a Denial of Service. The PostSRSd process would hang, rendering it unable to process valid requests from Postfix, disrupting email functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the communication between Postfix and the PostSRSd subprocess.
- An attacker needs to send a request to PostSRSd that contains a very long email address (or a series of concatenated email addresses) that exceeds the buffer size in the subprocess.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker does not need to be local but must be able to influence the input being sent to the PostSRSd daemon. This likely means the attacker would need to somehow inject the malicious email address into a mail flow that gets processed by the Postfix server.
- The attacker needs to be able to send an email to a Postfix server configured to use PostSRSd which causes the Postfix server to forward the crafted email address to the PostSRSd daemon.

**Additional Details (from the provided content):**
- The vulnerability is triggered when Postfix sends malformed requests containing concatenated email addresses, which is not how Postfix is supposed to behave.
- The fix implemented in commit `077be98d8c8a9847e4ae0c7dc09e7474cbe27db2` in the `postsrsd` repository addresses the issue by adding a check to see if input lines are too long and error out if they are.
- The fix involved adding a length check to `postsrsd.c` to return an error code (500 Invalid request) if the received line is greater or equal to the input buffer.
- The fix was included in version 1.11 of the software.
- The vulnerability is related to issue #37 in the project's issue tracker, where the issue was observed.
- The issue was reported by Mateusz Jo≈Ñczyk.
