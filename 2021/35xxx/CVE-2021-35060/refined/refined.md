Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the WAY4 ACS application's handling of error messages on the 3DS card enrollment page (`/way4acs/enroll`). The application returns distinct error messages depending on whether a provided payment card number (PAN) exists in the system or if it exists but is not yet ready for 3DS enrollment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The different error messages reveal information about the existence of PANs within the system. This allows an attacker to enumerate valid PANs.
*   **Lack of Consistent Error Handling:** The application's failure to provide consistent error messaging leads to an exploitable vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can enumerate valid payment card numbers (PANs). This could be a step in a larger attack, potentially leading to financial fraud if combined with other vulnerabilities or methods.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending requests to the `/way4acs/enroll` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application's `/way4acs/enroll` endpoint.
*   No specific authentication or prior knowledge of valid PANs is required; the attacker can brute force or use other techniques to identify existing PANs by observing the different error messages.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability affects WAY4 ACS versions before 1.2.278-2693.
* The vendor, OpenWay Group, has acknowledged the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Aleksey Shupletsov of Deiteriy Co. Ltd.

This detailed information is consistent with the description of CVE-2021-35060, where a PAN enumeration vulnerability is present due to inconsistent error message handling.
