Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-35234:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple exposed dangerous functions within the `SolarWinds.Orion.Core.Actions.dll` module and other classes (SendSyslog, PlaySound, TextToSpeech, Email). These functions allow for the execution of SQL queries constructed from user-supplied strings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The core weakness is the ability to inject malicious SQL queries by manipulating user-supplied input. The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the input before using it to construct SQL queries.
*   **Exposed Dangerous Functions:** The presence of these vulnerable functions, including SendSyslog, PlaySound, TextToSpeech, Email, CustomProperty, CustomStatus, SendHttpRequest, WriteToEventLog exposes the application to potential abuse.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker with low-level user privileges to escalate their privileges to the level of an application administrator.
*   **Data Theft:** The attacker can potentially steal password hashes and salt information by leveraging the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **Crafted Requests:** Attackers must craft malicious requests to trigger the execution of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Low-Privilege Access:** The attacker can be a user with low-level access.

**Affected Products:**

*   SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor
*   Orion Platform 2020.2.6 HF2 and earlier

**Patched version:**

*   Orion Platform 2020.2.6 HF3
