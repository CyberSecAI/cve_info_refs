Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35449:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper handling of DLL loading during the printer installation process within the Lexmark Universal Print Driver and other Lexmark printer drivers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource):** The driver allows a low-privileged user to load an arbitrary DLL during the "add printer" process. The user can choose the DLL which the driver will load. This is possible because the driver fails to enforce proper restrictions or validate the source or content of DLLs it loads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a low-privileged user to execute code with SYSTEM privileges. This gives the attacker complete control over the affected system. This access could be used to install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a local, low-privileged user initiating the "add printer" process. During this process the user is able to specify a malicious DLL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account with low privileges on the system where the vulnerable driver is installed. The attacker needs to be able to use the "add printer" functionality.
- The attacker must have the ability to create or place an arbitrary DLL that they intend to load, where the driver will be able to locate it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple Lexmark driver packages (Universal Print Driver, G2, G3, and G4 drivers) across different versions.
- The provided information indicates a publicly available exploit with a CVSS v3 score of 7.8, rated as HIGH severity.
- This information provides more detail than the base CVE description which only contains the placeholder.
