Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Deserialization of untrusted data in the Chart endpoint of the SolarWinds Patch Manager Web Console.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The Chart endpoint does not properly validate user-supplied data.
- This allows for the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE) on the server hosting the SolarWinds Patch Manager Web Console.
- An attacker can execute code in the context of the NETWORK SERVICE account.
- Potential compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access to the Orion Patch Manager Web Console is required.
- An attacker can send a malicious request to the vulnerable Chart endpoint.
- Although the ZDI advisory indicates that authentication is required, it also mentions that the authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The Solarwinds advisory does not mention this bypass.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the SolarWinds Patch Manager Web Console.
- Ability to craft a malicious request containing the serialized payload.
- The ZDI advisory mentions that a bypass for the authentication mechanism exists.

**Affected Products:**
- SolarWinds Patch Manager 2020.2.5 and earlier.

**Fixed Version:**
- SolarWinds Patch Manager 2020.2.6

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Jangggggg via Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- The CVSS score is 8.9 High according to Solarwinds, while ZDI reports 8.8, both indicate a critical vulnerability.
- The attack complexity is low, and no user interaction is required.
