Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The root cause is the absence of the "Secure" flag on the SSL cookie within Kiwi Syslog Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Secure Flag:** The primary weakness is that the "Secure" flag is not set on the SSL cookie. This flag is essential because it instructs the browser to only transmit the cookie over secure channels (HTTPS).
*   **Potential Clear Text Transmission:** If the application is accessible over both HTTP and HTTPS, the lack of the "Secure" flag allows the cookie to be sent via unencrypted HTTP requests, exposing it to potential eavesdropping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Cookie Exposure:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential exposure of the cookie due to transmission over insecure HTTP connections.
*   **Confidentiality Risk:** If a session cookie is intercepted, an attacker may be able to impersonate the user associated with the cookie.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker positioned on the network path between the client and the server could potentially intercept the cookie when it's sent over an unencrypted HTTP connection.
*   **Network Eavesdropping:** An attacker may passively eavesdrop on HTTP connections to capture the cookie.
*   **Downgrade Attack:** Attackers may try to force the user to connect to the server via HTTP rather than HTTPS to capture the cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** Attackers must have network access to intercept traffic between a client and the affected Kiwi Syslog Server.
*   **Eavesdropping Capability:** Attackers need the ability to monitor network traffic.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is specific to Kiwi Syslog Server 9.7.2 and prior versions.
* The issue is resolved in Kiwi Syslog Server 9.8.
* The CVSS score is 3.1 (Low), with the vector string as CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.
