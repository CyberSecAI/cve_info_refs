Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2021-35487, as well as additional vulnerability information found:

**CVE-2021-35487:**

This CVE ID is associated with the "Nokia Broadcast Message Center." The document provides the following details:

*   **Vulnerability Type:** Boolean Blind SQL Injection (CWE-89)
*   **Affected Software:** Nokia Broadcast Message Center <= 11.1.0
*  **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the extIdentifier parameter is vulnerable.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability in the application via the "ALERTS --> Manage Alerts" section, specifically in the "Basic Search" option by using the "extIdentifier" parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a remote authenticated user.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Through these queries it is possible to extrapolate arbitrary information, such as the user of the system executing the queries and the database version. Depending on the user permissions on the database, different types of queries are possible and consequently different types of information can be extracted.
