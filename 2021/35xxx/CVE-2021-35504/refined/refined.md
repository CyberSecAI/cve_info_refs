Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35504:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure implementation of the `checkFFmpeg` action within the Filerun application. It allows an attacker to control the path parameter that is passed to the ffmpeg executable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The `checkFFmpeg` action, intended to verify the FFmpeg installation, allows the injection of arbitrary commands. Specifically the path parameter is not properly sanitized allowing command injection via the pipe operator.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the web server user. This can lead to a complete compromise of the server, including data exfiltration, system manipulation, and further attacks.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with access to an administrative account can leverage this vulnerability to gain the privileges of the web server user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/` endpoint, targeting the `checkFFmpeg` action. The necessary parameters are supplied in the POST body.
- **`path` parameter:** The vulnerable `path` parameter is exploited via command injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated as an administrator user to access the vulnerable `checkFFmpeg` action.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Filerun server to send the malicious HTTP request.
