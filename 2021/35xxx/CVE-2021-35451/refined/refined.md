Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35451:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization within the Teradici PCoIP Console login error handling. Specifically, user-controlled input provided in the `flash` parameter of the URL is not properly sanitized before being reflected in the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Content/Text Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a text injection flaw. Arbitrary text can be injected into the user's browser via the `flash` parameter of the URL. This could potentially be used to craft misleading error messages or inject other content, although the specific impact seems limited based on the provided information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is described as the ability for an "unauthenticated remote user to inject arbitrary text into the user browser". It could potentially mislead the user with fabricated error messages, or potentially be used to conduct further attacks if the injection point is exploitable in a more complex manner, although this is not specified.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL. An attacker can construct a URL containing a `login_error=1&flash=<text>` parameter, where `<text>` is the arbitrary text to be injected. When a user navigates to this malicious URL, the text is reflected in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter.
- The attacker is not required to be authenticated to perform the attack. They only need the ability to get the victim to visit the crafted URL.
- The vulnerability affects the client-side, within the user's browser.
