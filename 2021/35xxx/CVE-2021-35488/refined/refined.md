Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2021-35488:

**CVE-2021-35488**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied data in the 'title' parameter, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be injected into the page.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - CWE-79
    *   Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page, which is then executed by the victim's browser.
    *   This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions if the user interacts with the injected content.

*  **Attack vectors:**
    *  A remote, unauthenticated attacker can inject the malicious code via the `title` HTTP GET parameter in the URL.
    *  The crafted URL would need to be visited by the victim to trigger the XSS.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   *  No authentication is required.
   * The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and entice a user to visit the crafted link
