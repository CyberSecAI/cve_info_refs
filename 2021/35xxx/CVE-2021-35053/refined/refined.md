Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-35053:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Directory Traversal:**  The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied paths before using them in file operations within the Kaspersky Lab Launcher. This allows an attacker to manipulate file paths.
*   **Symbolic Link Abuse:** Another report indicates the vulnerability is related to creating a symbolic link, which can then be abused by the Safe Browser to overwrite files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied paths. This allows an attacker to control the destination of file operations.
*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability involves path traversal, where an attacker can manipulate file paths to access locations outside of intended directories.
*   **File Overwrite:** The symbolic link manipulation enables arbitrary file overwriting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is the creation of a denial-of-service condition on the system. By exploiting the vulnerability, an attacker can cause the system to become unstable or unusable.
*   **File Corruption:** The vulnerability could also be used to corrupt critical system files by overwriting them.
*   **Possible System Unbootable:** One of the advisories mentions that "An attacker could change specific Firefox browser parameters file in a certain way and then reboot the system to make the system unbootable"

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability and must have low-privileged code execution capability.
*   **Maliciously Crafted File Paths:** The attacker manipulates user-supplied paths.
*  **Symbolic Link Manipulation:** The attacker creates symbolic links to manipulate file operations.
*   **Firefox parameter manipulation** The attacker must be able to change Firefox parameters file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Code Execution:** The attacker must be able to execute code with low privileges on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Abdelhamid Naceri and reported through Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   Kaspersky has released updates to address this vulnerability.
*   The ZDI advisories specify that the vulnerability exists in Kaspersky Total Security. The Kaspersky advisory states the vulnerability affects multiple products (Kaspersky Anti-Virus, Kaspersky Internet Security, Kaspersky Total Security, Kaspersky Small Office Security, Kaspersky Security Cloud, and Kaspersky Endpoint Security)
*   One of the advisories mentions that a possible system denial of service could occur by "changing Firefox browser parameters" in a certain way.
