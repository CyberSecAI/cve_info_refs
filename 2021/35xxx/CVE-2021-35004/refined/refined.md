- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow occurs due to improper handling of DNS responses. A crafted DNS message can overflow a fixed-length, stack-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A crafted DNS message sent over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device to send the crafted DNS message. Authentication is not required.
