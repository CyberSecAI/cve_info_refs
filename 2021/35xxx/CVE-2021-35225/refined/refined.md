Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-35225

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control within the NetPath feature of SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor (NPM) in Managed Service Provider (MSP) environments. Specifically, any authenticated user could view and browse NetPath Services belonging to all MSP customers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Horizontal Privilege Escalation:** An authenticated user, regardless of their assigned customer, could access information about other customers' NetPath services.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The application failed to enforce proper segregation of customer data within the NetPath feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Limited Insight into Other Customers' Infrastructure:** An attacker could potentially gain information about other customers' network infrastructure by viewing their NetPath service configurations.
- **Data Cross-Contamination:** The vulnerability could lead to the unintentional or malicious exposure of customer-specific data to unauthorized users, potentially violating data privacy.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability was accessible via the web interface of the SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needed to be a valid authenticated user within an MSP environment.
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid credentials for a SolarWinds NPM account within an MSP setup.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needed network access to the SolarWinds NPM instance.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Network Performance Monitor 2020.2.6 HF2 or later.
- Implement the workaround mentioned in the advisory, if an upgrade is not immediately possible.

**CVSS Score:**
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N (5.0 Medium)
