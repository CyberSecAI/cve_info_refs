{
  "CVE-2021-35039": {
    "Root cause": "A flaw in module signature enforcement.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "A custom kernel with IMA enabled might have allowed loading unsigned kernel modules when it should not have. This occurs when the kernel is built without CONFIG_MODULE_SIG, but the `module.sig_enforce=1` boot parameter is specified.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Loading unsigned kernel modules when it should not have been allowed.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access via init_module syscall.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local user with the ability to load kernel modules could bypass signature enforcement."
  }
