                 CVE-2021-38199 CVE-2021-38205 CVE-2021-40490

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2020-3702

    A flaw was found in the driver for Atheros IEEE 802.11n family of
    chipsets (ath9k) allowing information disclosure.

CVE-2020-16119

    Hadar Manor reported a use-after-free in the DCCP protocol
    implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker can take
    advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially
    to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-3444, CVE-2021-3600

    Two flaws were discovered in the Extended BPF (eBPF) verifier.  A
    local user could exploit these to read and write arbitrary memory
    in the kernel, which could be used for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by setting sysctl
    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by
    unprivileged users.

CVE-2021-3612

    Murray McAllister reported a flaw in the joystick input subsystem.
    A local user permitted to access a joystick device could exploit
    this to read and write out-of-bounds in the kernel, which could
    be used for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3653

   Maxim Levitsky discovered a vulnerability in the KVM hypervisor
   implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel: Missing
   validation of the `int_ctl` VMCB field could allow a malicious L1
   guest to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt
   Controller) for the L2 guest. The L2 guest can take advantage of
   this flaw to write to a limited but still relatively large subset
   of the host physical memory.

CVE-2021-3655

    Ilja Van Sprundel and Marcelo Ricardo Leitner found multiple flaws
    in the SCTP implementation, where missing validation could lead to
    an out-of-bounds read.  On a system using SCTP, a networked
    attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-3656

    Maxim Levitsky and Paolo Bonzini discovered a flaw in the KVM
    hypervisor implementation for AMD processors in the Linux
    kernel. Missing validation of the `virt_ext` VMCB field could
    allow a malicious L1 guest to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE
    intercepts and VLS (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. Under
    these circumstances, the L2 guest is able to run VMLOAD/VMSAVE
    unintercepted and thus read/write portions of the host's physical
    memory.

CVE-2021-3679

    A flaw in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality could
    allow a privileged local user (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) to
    cause a denial of service (resource starvation).

CVE-2021-3732

    Alois Wohlschlager reported a flaw in the implementation of the
    overlayfs subsystem, allowing a local attacker with privileges to
    mount a filesystem to reveal files hidden in the original mount.

CVE-2021-3743

    An out-of-bounds memory read was discovered in the Qualcomm IPC
    router protocol implementation, allowing to cause a denial of
    service or information leak.

CVE-2021-3753

    Minh Yuan reported a race condition in the vt_k_ioctl in
    drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c, which may cause an out of bounds read
    in vt.

CVE-2021-22543

    David Stevens discovered a flaw in how the KVM hypervisor maps
    host memory into a guest.  A local user permitted to access
    /dev/kvm could use this to cause certain pages to be freed when
    they should not, leading to a use-after-free.  This could be used
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-33624, CVE-2021-34556, CVE-2021-35477

    Multiple researchers discovered flaws in the Extended BPF (eBPF)
    verifier's protections against information leaks through
    speculation execution.  A local user could exploit these to read
    sensitive information.

    This can be mitigated by setting sysctl
    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by
    unprivileged users.

CVE-2021-35039

    A flaw was discovered in module signature enforcement.  A custom
    kernel with IMA enabled might have allowed loading unsigned kernel
    modules when it should not have.

CVE-2021-37159

    A flaw was discovered in the hso driver for Option mobile
    broadband modems.  An error during initialisation could lead to a
    double-free or use-after-free.  An attacker able to plug in USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-38160

    A flaw in the virtio_console was discovered allowing data
    corruption or data loss by an untrusted device.

CVE-2021-38198

    A flaw was discovered in the KVM implementation for x86
    processors, that could result in virtual memory protection within
    a guest not being applied correctly.  When shadow page tables are
    used - i.e. for nested virtualisation, or on CPUs lacking the EPT
    or NPT feature - a user of the guest OS might be able to exploit
    this for denial of service or privilege escalation within the
    guest.

CVE-2021-38199

    Michael Wakabayashi reported a flaw in the NFSv4 client
    implementation, where incorrect connection setup ordering allows
    operations of a remote NFSv4 server to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-38205

    An information leak was discovered in the xilinx_emaclite network
    driver.  On a custom kernel where this driver is enabled and used,
    this might make it easier to exploit other kernel bugs.

CVE-2021-40490

    A race condition was discovered in the ext4 subsystem when writing
    to an inline_data file while its xattrs are changing. This could
    result in denial of service.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.208-1~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.19 packages.

module: limit enabling module.sig\_enforceIrrespective as to whether CONFIG\_MODULE\_SIG is configured, specifying
"module.sig\_enforce=1" on the boot command line sets "sig\_enforce".
Only allow "sig\_enforce" to be set when CONFIG\_MODULE\_SIG is configured.
This patch makes the presence of /sys/module/module/parameters/sig\_enforce
dependent on CONFIG\_MODULE\_SIG=y.

integrity: Load mokx variables into the blacklist keyring
[ Upstream commit ebd9c2ae369a45bdd9f8615484db09be58fc242b ]
During boot the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database, dbx,
is loaded into the blacklist keyring. Systems booted with shim
have an equivalent Forbidden Signature Database called mokx.
Currently mokx is only used by shim and grub, the contents are
ignored by the kernel.
Add the ability to load mokx into the blacklist keyring during boot.

certs: Add ability to preload revocation certs
[ Upstream commit d1f044103dad70c1cec0a8f3abdf00834fec8b98 ]
Add a new Kconfig option called SYSTEM\_REVOCATION\_KEYS. If set,
this option should be the filename of a PEM-formated file containing
X.509 certificates to be included in the default blacklist keyring.
DH Changes:
- Make the new Kconfig option depend on SYSTEM\_REVOCATION\_LIST.
- Fix SYSTEM\_REVOCATION\_KEYS=n, but CONFIG\_SYSTEM\_REVOCATION\_LIST=y[1][2].
- Use CONFIG\_SYSTEM\_REVOCATION\_LIST for extract-cert[3].
- Use CONFIG\_SYSTEM\_REVOCATION\_LIST for revocation\_certificates.o[3].

certs: Add EFI\_CERT\_X509\_GUID support for dbx entries
[ Upstream commit 56c5812623f95313f6a46fbf0beee7fa17c68bbf ]
This fixes CVE-2020-26541.
The Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database, dbx, contains a list of now
revoked signatures and keys previously approved to boot with UEFI Secure
Boot enabled. The dbx is capable of containing any number of
EFI\_CERT\_X509\_SHA256\_GUID, EFI\_CERT\_SHA256\_GUID, and EFI\_CERT\_X509\_GUID
entries.
Currently when EFI\_CERT\_X509\_GUID are contained in the dbx, the entries are
skipped.
Add support for EFI\_CERT\_X509\_GUID dbx entries. When a EFI\_CERT\_X509\_GUID
is found, it is added as an asymmetrical key to the .blacklist keyring.
Anytime the .platform keyring is used, the keys in the .blacklist keyring
are referenced, if a matching key is found, the key will be rejected.
[DH: Made the following changes:
- Added to have a config option to enable the facility. This allows a
Kconfig solution to make sure that pkcs7\_validate\_trust() is
enabled.[1][2]
- Moved the functions out from the middle of the blacklist functions.
- Added kerneldoc comments.]

mm/hwpoison: do not lock page again when me\_huge\_page() successfully recovers
commit ea6d0630100b285f059d0a8d8e86f38a46407536 upstream.
Currently me\_huge\_page() temporary unlocks page to perform some actions
then locks it again later. My testcase (which calls hard-offline on
some tail page in a hugetlb, then accesses the address of the hugetlb
range) showed that page allocation code detects this page lock on buddy
page and printed out "BUG: Bad page state" message.
check\_new\_page\_bad() does not consider a page with \_\_PG\_HWPOISON as bad
page, so this flag works as kind of filter, but this filtering doesn't
work in this case because the "bad page" is not the actual hwpoisoned
page. So stop locking page again. Actions to be taken depend on the
page type of the error, so page unlocking should be done in ->action()
callbacks. So let's make it assumed and change all existing callbacks
that way.

netfs: fix test for whether we can skip read when writing beyond EOF
commit 827a746f405d25f79560c7868474aec5aee174e1 upstream.
It's not sufficient to skip reading when the pos is beyond the EOF.
There may be data at the head of the page that we need to fill in
before the write.
Add a new helper function that corrects and clarifies the logic of
when we can skip reads, and have it only zero out the part of the page
that won't have data copied in for the write.
Finally, don't set the page Uptodate after zeroing. It's not up to date
since the write data won't have been copied in yet.
[DH made the following changes:
- Prefixed the new function with "netfs\_".
- Don't call zero\_user\_segments() for a full-page write.
- Altered the beyond-last-page check to avoid a DIV instruction and got
rid of then-redundant zero-length file check.
]
[ Note: this fix is commit 827a746f405d in mainline kernels. The
original bug was in ceph, but got lifted into the fs/netfs
library for v5.13. This backport should apply to stable
kernels v5.10 though v5.12. ]

swiotlb: manipulate orig\_addr when tlb\_addr has offset
commit 5f89468e2f060031cd89fd4287298e0eaf246bf6 upstream.
in case of driver wants to sync part of ranges with offset,
swiotlb\_tbl\_sync\_single() copies from orig\_addr base to tlb\_addr with
offset and ends up with data mismatch.
It was removed from
"swiotlb: don't modify orig\_addr in swiotlb\_tbl\_sync\_single",
but said logic has to be added back in.
From Linus's email:
"That commit which the removed the offset calculation entirely, because the old
(unsigned long)tlb\_addr & (IO\_TLB\_SIZE - 1)
was wrong, but instead of removing it, I think it should have just
fixed it to be
(tlb\_addr - mem->start) & (IO\_TLB\_SIZE - 1);
instead. That way the slot offset always matches the slot index calculation."
(Unfortunatly that broke NVMe).
The use-case that drivers are hitting is as follow:
1. Get dma\_addr\_t from dma\_map\_single()
dma\_addr\_t tlb\_addr = dma\_map\_single(dev, vaddr, vsize, DMA\_TO\_DEVICE);
|<---------------vsize------------->|
+-----------------------------------+
| | original buffer
+-----------------------------------+
vaddr
swiotlb\_align\_offset
|<----->|<---------------vsize------------->|
+-------+-----------------------------------+
| | | swiotlb buffer
+-------+-----------------------------------+
tlb\_addr
2. Do something
3. Sync dma\_addr\_t through dma\_sync\_single\_for\_device(..)
dma\_sync\_single\_for\_device(dev, tlb\_addr + offset, size, DMA\_TO\_DEVICE);
Error case.
Copy data to original buffer but it is from base addr (instead of
base addr + offset) in original buffer:
swiotlb\_align\_offset
|<----->|<- offset ->|<- size ->|
+-------+-----------------------------------+
| | |##########| | swiotlb buffer
+-------+-----------------------------------+
tlb\_addr
|<- size ->|
+-----------------------------------+
|##########| | original buffer
+-----------------------------------+
vaddr
The fix is to copy the data to the original buffer and take into
account the offset, like so:
swiotlb\_align\_offset
|<----->|<- offset ->|<- size ->|
+-------+-----------------------------------+
| | |##########| | swiotlb buffer
+-------+-----------------------------------+
tlb\_addr
|<- offset ->|<- size ->|
+-----------------------------------+
| |##########| | original buffer
+-----------------------------------+
vaddr
[One fix which was Linus's that made more sense to as it created a
symmetry would break NVMe. The reason for that is the:
unsigned int offset = (tlb\_addr - mem->start) & (IO\_TLB\_SIZE - 1);
would come up with the proper offset, but it would lose the
alignment (which this patch contains).]

KVM: SVM: Call SEV Guest Decommission if ASID binding fails
commit 934002cd660b035b926438244b4294e647507e13 upstream.
Send SEV\_CMD\_DECOMMISSION command to PSP firmware if ASID binding
fails. If a failure happens after a successful LAUNCH\_START command,
a decommission command should be executed. Otherwise, guest context
will be unfreed inside the AMD SP. After the firmware will not have
memory to allocate more SEV guest context, LAUNCH\_START command will
begin to fail with SEV\_RET\_RESOURCE\_LIMIT error.
The existing code calls decommission inside sev\_unbind\_asid, but it is
not called if a failure happens before guest activation succeeds. If
sev\_bind\_asid fails, decommission is never called. PSP firmware has a
limit for the number of guests. If sev\_asid\_binding fails many times,
PSP firmware will not have resources to create another guest context.

mm, futex: fix shared futex pgoff on shmem huge page
commit fe19bd3dae3d15d2fbfdb3de8839a6ea0fe94264 upstream.
If more than one futex is placed on a shmem huge page, it can happen
that waking the second wakes the first instead, and leaves the second
waiting: the key's shared.pgoff is wrong.
When 3.11 commit 13d60f4b6ab5 ("futex: Take hugepages into account when
generating futex\_key"), the only shared huge pages came from hugetlbfs,
and the code added to deal with its exceptional page->index was put into
hugetlb source. Then that was missed when 4.8 added shmem huge pages.
page\_to\_pgoff() is what others use for this nowadays: except that, as
currently written, it gives the right answer on hugetlbfs head, but
nonsense on hugetlbfs tails. Fix that by calling hugetlbfs-specific
hugetlb\_basepage\_index() on PageHuge tails as well as on head.
Yes, it's unconventional to declare hugetlb\_basepage\_index() there in
pagemap.h, rather than in hugetlb.h; but I do not expect anything but
page\_to\_pgoff() ever to need it.

mm/thp: fix page\_vma\_mapped\_walk() if THP mapped by ptes
commit a9a7504d9beaf395481faa91e70e2fd08f7a3dde upstream.
Running certain tests with a DEBUG\_VM kernel would crash within hours,
on the total\_mapcount BUG() in split\_huge\_page\_to\_list(), while trying
to free up some memory by punching a hole in a shmem huge page: split's
try\_to\_unmap() was unable to find all the mappings of the page (which,
on a !DEBUG\_VM kernel, would then keep the huge page pinned in memory).
Crash dumps showed two tail pages of a shmem huge page remained mapped
by pte: ptes in a non-huge-aligned vma of a gVisor process, at the end
of a long unmapped range; and no page table had yet been allocated for
the head of the huge page to be mapped into.
Although designed to handle these odd misaligned huge-page-mapped-by-pte
cases, page\_vma\_mapped\_walk() falls short by returning false prematurely
when !pmd\_present or !pud\_present or !p4d\_present or !pgd\_present: there
are cases when a huge page may span the boundary, with ptes present in
the next.
Restructure page\_vma\_mapped\_walk() as a loop to continue in these cases,
while keeping its layout much as before. Add a step\_forward() helper to
advance pvmw->address across those boundaries: originally I tried to use
mm's standard p?d\_addr\_end() macros, but hit the same crash 512 times
less often: because of the way redundant levels are folded together, but
folded differently in different configurations, it was just too
difficult to use them correctly; and step\_forward() is simpler anyway.

commit 3306d3119ceacc43ea8b141a73e21fea68eec30c upstream.
page\_vma\_mapped\_walk() cleanup: re-evaluate pmde after taking lock, then
use it in subsequent tests, instead of repeatedly dereferencing pointer.

mm: page\_vma\_mapped\_walk(): use page for pvmw->page
commit f003c03bd29e6f46fef1b9a8e8d636ac732286d5 upstream.
Patch series "mm: page\_vma\_mapped\_walk() cleanup and THP fixes".
I've marked all of these for stable: many are merely cleanups, but I
think they are much better before the main fix than after.
This patch (of 11):
page\_vma\_mapped\_walk() cleanup: sometimes the local copy of pvwm->page
was used, sometimes pvmw->page itself: use the local copy "page"
throughout.

mm: thp: replace DEBUG\_VM BUG with VM\_WARN when unmap fails for split
commit 504e070dc08f757bccaed6d05c0f53ecbfac8a23 upstream.
When debugging the bug reported by Wang Yugui [1], try\_to\_unmap() may
fail, but the first VM\_BUG\_ON\_PAGE() just checks page\_mapcount() however
it may miss the failure when head page is unmapped but other subpage is
mapped. Then the second DEBUG\_VM BUG() that check total mapcount would
catch it. This may incur some confusion.
As this is not a fatal issue, so consolidate the two DEBUG\_VM checks
into one VM\_WARN\_ON\_ONCE\_PAGE().

mm/thp: unmap\_mapping\_page() to fix THP truncate\_cleanup\_page()
commit 22061a1ffabdb9c3385de159c5db7aac3a4df1cc upstream.
There is a race between THP unmapping and truncation, when truncate sees
pmd\_none() and skips the entry, after munmap's zap\_huge\_pmd() cleared
it, but before its page\_remove\_rmap() gets to decrement
compound\_mapcount: generating false "BUG: Bad page cache" reports that
the page is still mapped when deleted. This commit fixes that, but not
in the way I hoped.
The first attempt used try\_to\_unmap(page, TTU\_SYNC|TTU\_IGNORE\_MLOCK)
instead of unmap\_mapping\_range() in truncate\_cleanup\_page(): it has
often been an annoyance that we usually call unmap\_mapping\_range() with
no pages locked, but there apply it to a single locked page.
try\_to\_unmap() looks more suitable for a single locked page.
However, try\_to\_unmap\_one() contains a VM\_BUG\_ON\_PAGE(!pvmw.pte,page):
it is used to insert THP migration entries, but not used to unmap THPs.
Copy zap\_huge\_pmd() and add THP handling now? Perhaps, but their TLB
needs are different, I'm too ignorant of the DAX cases, and couldn't
decide how far to go for anon+swap. Set that aside.
The second attempt took a different tack: make no change in truncate.c,
but modify zap\_huge\_pmd() to insert an invalidated huge pmd instead of
clearing it initially, then pmd\_clear() between page\_remove\_rmap() and
unlocking at the end. Nice. But powerpc blows that approach out of the
water, with its serialize\_against\_pte\_lookup(), and interesting pgtable
usage. It would need serious help to get working on powerpc (with a
minor optimization issue on s390 too). Set that aside.
Just add an "if (page\_mapped(page)) synchronize\_rcu();" or other such
delay, after unmapping in truncate\_cleanup\_page()? Perhaps, but though
that's likely to reduce or eliminate the number of incidents, it would
give less assurance of whether we had identified the problem correctly.
This successful iteration introduces "unmap\_mapping\_page(page)" instead
of try\_to\_unmap(), and goes the usual unmap\_mapping\_range\_tree() route,
with an addition to details. Then zap\_pmd\_range() watches for this
case, and does spin\_unlock(pmd\_lock) if so - just like
page\_vma\_mapped\_walk() now does in the PVMW\_SYNC case. Not pretty, but
safe.
Note that unmap\_mapping\_page() is doing a VM\_BUG\_ON(!PageLocked) to
assert its interface; but currently that's only used to make sure that
page->mapping is stable, and zap\_pmd\_range() doesn't care if the page is
locked or not. Along these lines, in invalidate\_inode\_pages2\_range()
move the initial unmap\_mapping\_range() out from under page lock, before
then calling unmap\_mapping\_page() under page lock if still mapped.

fix a subtle trap in a general helper: best fixed in stable sooner than

mm/thp: fix vma\_address() if virtual address below file offset
commit 494334e43c16d63b878536a26505397fce6ff3a2 upstream.
Running certain tests with a DEBUG\_VM kernel would crash within hours,
on the total\_mapcount BUG() in split\_huge\_page\_to\_list(), while trying
to free up some memory by punching a hole in a shmem huge page: split's
try\_to\_unmap() was unable to find all the mappings of the page (which,
on a !DEBUG\_VM kernel, would then keep the huge page pinned in memory).
When that BUG() was changed to a WARN(), it would later crash on the
VM\_BUG\_ON\_VMA(end < vma->vm\_start || start >= vma->vm\_end, vma) in
mm/internal.h:vma\_address(), used by rmap\_walk\_file() for
try\_to\_unmap().
vma\_address() is usually correct, but there's a wraparound case when the
vm\_start address is unusually low, but vm\_pgoff not so low:
vma\_address() chooses max(start, vma->vm\_start), but that decides on the
wrong address, because start has become almost ULONG\_MAX.
Rewrite vma\_address() to be more careful about vm\_pgoff; move the
VM\_BUG\_ON\_VMA() out of it, returning -EFAULT for errors, so that it can
be safely used from page\_mapped\_in\_vma() and page\_address\_in\_vma() too.
Add vma\_address\_end() to apply similar care to end address calculation,
in page\_vma\_mapped\_walk() and page\_mkclean\_one() and try\_to\_unmap\_one();
though it raises a question of whether callers would do better to supply
pvmw->end to page\_vma\_mapped\_walk() - I chose not, for a smaller patch.
An irritation is that their apparent generality breaks down on KSM
pages, which cannot be located by the page->index that page\_to\_pgoff()
uses: as commit 4b0ece6fa016 ("mm: migrate: fix remove\_migration\_pte()
for ksm pages") once discovered. I dithered over the best thing to do
about that, and have ended up with a VM\_BUG\_ON\_PAGE(PageKsm) in both
vma\_address() and vma\_address\_end(); though the only place in danger of
using it on them was try\_to\_unmap\_one().
Sidenote: vma\_address() and vma\_address\_end() now use compound\_nr() on a
head page, instead of thp\_size(): to make the right calculation on a
hugetlbfs page, whether or not THPs are configured. try\_to\_unmap() is
used on hugetlbfs pages, but perhaps the wrong calculation never
mattered.

mm/thp: try\_to\_unmap() use TTU\_SYNC for safe splitting
commit 732ed55823fc3ad998d43b86bf771887bcc5ec67 upstream.
Stressing huge tmpfs often crashed on unmap\_page()'s VM\_BUG\_ON\_PAGE
(!unmap\_success): with dump\_page() showing mapcount:1, but then its raw
struct page output showing \_mapcount ffffffff i.e. mapcount 0.
And even if that particular VM\_BUG\_ON\_PAGE(!unmap\_success) is removed,
it is immediately followed by a VM\_BUG\_ON\_PAGE(compound\_mapcount(head)),
and further down an IS\_ENABLED(CONFIG\_DEBUG\_VM) total\_mapcount BUG():
all indicative of some mapcount difficulty in development here perhaps.
But the !CONFIG\_DEBUG\_VM path handles the failures correctly and
silently.
I believe the problem is that once a racing unmap has cleared pte or
pmd, try\_to\_unmap\_one() may skip taking the page table lock, and emerge
from try\_to\_unmap() before the racing task has reached decrementing
mapcount.
Instead of abandoning the unsafe VM\_BUG\_ON\_PAGE(), and the ones that
follow, use PVMW\_SYNC in try\_to\_unmap\_one() in this case: adding
TTU\_SYNC to the options, and passing that from unmap\_page().
When CONFIG\_DEBUG\_VM, or for non-debug too? Consensus is to do the same
for both: the slight overhead added should rarely matter, except perhaps
if splitting sparsely-populated multiply-mapped shmem. Once confident
that bugs are fixed, TTU\_SYNC here can be removed, and the race
tolerated.

mm/thp: make is\_huge\_zero\_pmd() safe and quicker
commit 3b77e8c8cde581dadab9a0f1543a347e24315f11 upstream.
Most callers of is\_huge\_zero\_pmd() supply a pmd already verified
present; but a few (notably zap\_huge\_pmd()) do not - it might be a pmd
migration entry, in which the pfn is encoded differently from a present
pmd: which might pass the is\_huge\_zero\_pmd() test (though not on x86,
since L1TF forced us to protect against that); or perhaps even crash in
pmd\_page() applied to a swap-like entry.
Make it safe by adding pmd\_present() check into is\_huge\_zero\_pmd()
itself; and make it quicker by saving huge\_zero\_pfn, so that
is\_huge\_zero\_pmd() will not need to do that pmd\_page() lookup each time.
\_\_split\_huge\_pmd\_locked() checked pmd\_trans\_huge() before: that worked,
but is unnecessary now that is\_huge\_zero\_pmd() checks present.

mm/thp: fix \_\_split\_huge\_pmd\_locked() on shmem migration entry
commit 99fa8a48203d62b3743d866fc48ef6abaee682be upstream.
Patch series "mm/thp: fix THP splitting unmap BUGs and related", v10.
Here is v2 batch of long-standing THP bug fixes that I had not got
around to sending before, but prompted now by Wang Yugui's report
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20210412180659.B9E3.409509F4@e16-tech.com/
Wang Yugui has tested a rollup of these fixes applied to 5.10.39, and
they have done no harm, but have \*not\* fixed that issue: something more
is needed and I have no idea of what.
This patch (of 7):
Stressing huge tmpfs page migration racing hole punch often crashed on
the VM\_BUG\_ON(!pmd\_present) in pmdp\_huge\_clear\_flush(), with DEBUG\_VM=y
kernel; or shortly afterwards, on a bad dereference in
\_\_split\_huge\_pmd\_locked() when DEBUG\_VM=n. They forgot to allow for pmd
migration entries in the non-anonymous case.
Full disclosure: those particular experiments were on a kernel with more
relaxed mmap\_lock and i\_mmap\_rwsem locking, and were not repeated on the
vanilla kernel: it is conceivable that stricter locking happens to avoid
those cases, or makes them less likely; but \_\_split\_huge\_pmd\_locked()
already allowed for pmd migration entries when handling anonymous THPs,
so this commit brings the shmem and file THP handling into line.
And while there: use old\_pmd rather than \_pmd, as in the following
blocks; and make it clearer to the eye that the !vma\_is\_anonymous()
block is self-contained, making an early return after accounting for
unmapping.

mm, thp: use head page in \_\_migration\_entry\_wait()
commit ffc90cbb2970ab88b66ea51dd580469eede57b67 upstream.
We notice that hung task happens in a corner but practical scenario when
CONFIG\_PREEMPT\_NONE is enabled, as follows.
Process 0 Process 1 Process 2..Inf
split\_huge\_page\_to\_list
unmap\_page
split\_huge\_pmd\_address
\_\_migration\_entry\_wait(head)
\_\_migration\_entry\_wait(tail)
remap\_page (roll back)
remove\_migration\_ptes
rmap\_walk\_anon
cond\_resched
Where \_\_migration\_entry\_wait(tail) is occurred in kernel space, e.g.,
copy\_to\_user in fstat, which will immediately fault again without
rescheduling, and thus occupy the cpu fully.
When there are too many processes performing \_\_migration\_entry\_wait on
tail page, remap\_page will never be done after cond\_resched.
This makes \_\_migration\_entry\_wait operate on the compound head page,
thus waits for remap\_page to complete, whether the THP is split
successfully or roll back.
Note that put\_and\_wait\_on\_page\_locked helps to drop the page reference
acquired with get\_page\_unless\_zero, as soon as the page is on the wait
queue, before actually waiting. So splitting the THP is only prevented
for a brief interval.

mm/memory-failure: use a mutex to avoid memory\_failure() races
commit 171936ddaf97e6f4e1264f4128bb5cf15691339c upstream.
Patch series "mm,hwpoison: fix sending SIGBUS for Action Required MCE", v5.
I wrote this patchset to materialize what I think is the current
allowable solution mentioned by the previous discussion [1]. I simply
borrowed Tony's mutex patch and Aili's return code patch, then I queued
another one to find error virtual address in the best effort manner. I
know that this is not a perfect solution, but should work for some
typical case.
[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20210331192540.2141052f@alex-virtual-machine/
This patch (of 2):
There can be races when multiple CPUs consume poison from the same page.
The first into memory\_failure() atomically sets the HWPoison page flag
and begins hunting for tasks that map this page. Eventually it
invalidates those mappings and may send a SIGBUS to the affected tasks.
But while all that work is going on, other CPUs see a "success" return
code from memory\_failure() and so they believe the error has been
handled and continue executing.
Fix by wrapping most of the internal parts of memory\_failure() in a
mutex.

x86/fpu: Make init\_fpstate correct with optimized XSAVE
commit f9dfb5e390fab2df9f7944bb91e7705aba14cd26 upstream.
The XSAVE init code initializes all enabled and supported components with
XRSTOR(S) to init state. Then it XSAVEs the state of the components back
into init\_fpstate which is used in several places to fill in the init state
of components.
This works correctly with XSAVE, but not with XSAVEOPT and XSAVES because
those use the init optimization and skip writing state of components which
are in init state. So init\_fpstate.xsave still contains all zeroes after
this operation.
There are two ways to solve that:
1) Use XSAVE unconditionally, but that requires to reshuffle the buffer when
XSAVES is enabled because XSAVES uses compacted format.
2) Save the components which are known to have a non-zero init state by other
means.
Looking deeper, #2 is the right thing to do because all components the
kernel supports have all-zeroes init state except the legacy features (FP,
SSE). Those cannot be hard coded because the states are not identical on all
CPUs, but they can be saved with FXSAVE which avoids all conditionals.
Use FXSAVE to save the legacy FP/SSE components in init\_fpstate along with
a BUILD\_BUG\_ON() which reminds developers to validate that a newly added
component has all zeroes init state. As a bonus remove the now unused
copy\_xregs\_to\_kernel\_booting() crutch.
The XSAVE and reshuffle method can still be implemented in the unlikely
case that components are added which have a non-zero init state and no
other means to save them. For now, FXSAVE is just simple and good enough.

sanitize\_restored\_user\_xstate() preserves the supervisor states only

It is caused by the following race between kthread\_mod\_delayed\_work()
and kthread\_cancel\_delayed\_work\_sync():
CPU0 CPU1
Context: Thread A Context: Thread B
kthread\_mod\_delayed\_work()
spin\_lock()
\_\_kthread\_cancel\_work()

queue\_delayed\_work()
// dwork is put into the worker->delayed\_work\_list
spin\_unlock()
kthread\_flush\_work()
// flush\_work is put at the tail of the dwork
wait\_for\_completion()
Context: IRQ
kthread\_delayed\_work\_timer\_fn()
spin\_lock()
list\_del\_init(&work->node);
spin\_unlock()
BANG: flush\_work is not longer linked and will never get proceed.
The problem is that kthread\_mod\_delayed\_work() checks work->canceling
flag before canceling the timer.
A simple solution is to (re)check work->canceling after
\_\_kthread\_cancel\_work(). But then it is not clear what should be
returned when \_\_kthread\_cancel\_work() removed the work from the queue
(list) and it can't queue it again with the new @delay.
The return value might be used for reference counting. The caller has
to know whether a new work has been queued or an existing one was
replaced.
The proper solution is that kthread\_mod\_delayed\_work() will remove the
work from the queue (list) \_only\_ when work->canceling is not set. The
flag must be checked after the timer is stopped and the remaining
operations can be done under worker->lock.
Note that kthread\_mod\_delayed\_work() could remove the timer and then
bail out. It is fine. The other canceling caller needs to cancel the
timer as well. The important thing is that the queue (list)
manipulation is done atomically under worker->lock.

KVM: do not allow mapping valid but non-reference-counted pages
commit f8be156be163a052a067306417cd0ff679068c97 upstream.
It's possible to create a region which maps valid but non-refcounted
pages (e.g., tail pages of non-compound higher order allocations). These
host pages can then be returned by gfn\_to\_page, gfn\_to\_pfn, etc., family
of APIs, which take a reference to the page, which takes it from 0 to 1.
When the reference is dropped, this will free the page incorrectly.
Fix this by only taking a reference on valid pages if it was non-zero,
which indicates it is participating in normal refcounting (and can be
released with put\_page).
This addresses CVE-2021-22543.

s390: fix system call restart with multiple signals
commit fc66127dc3396338f287c3b494dfbf102547e770 upstream.
glibc complained with "The futex facility returned an unexpected error
code.". It turned out that the futex syscall returned -ERESTARTSYS because
a signal is pending. arch\_do\_signal\_or\_restart() restored the syscall
parameters (nameley regs->gprs[2]) and set PIF\_SYSCALL\_RESTART. When
another signal is made pending later in the exit loop
arch\_do\_signal\_or\_restart() is called again. This function clears
PIF\_SYSCALL\_RESTART and checks the return code which is set in
regs->gprs[2]. However, regs->gprs[2] was restored in the previous run
and no longer contains -ERESTARTSYS, so PIF\_SYSCALL\_RESTART isn't set
again and the syscall is skipped.
Fix this by not clearing PIF\_SYSCALL\_RESTART - it is already cleared in
\_\_do\_syscall() when the syscall is restarted.

s390/stack: fix possible register corruption with stack switch helper
commit 67147e96a332b56c7206238162771d82467f86c0 upstream.
The CALL\_ON\_STACK macro is used to call a C function from inline
assembly, and therefore must consider the C ABI, which says that only
registers 6-13, and 15 are non-volatile (restored by the called
function).
The inline assembly incorrectly marks all registers used to pass
parameters to the called function as read-only input operands, instead
of operands that are read and written to. This might result in
register corruption depending on usage, compiler, and compile options.
Fix this by marking all operands used to pass parameters as read/write
operands. To keep the code simple even register 6, if used, is marked
as read-write operand.

perf/x86: Track pmu in per-CPU cpu\_hw\_events
[ Upstream commit 61e76d53c39bb768ad264d379837cfc56b9e35b4 ]
Some platforms, e.g. Alder Lake, have hybrid architecture. In the same
package, there may be more than one type of CPU. The PMU capabilities
are different among different types of CPU. Perf will register a
dedicated PMU for each type of CPU.
Add a 'pmu' variable in the struct cpu\_hw\_events to track the dedicated
PMU of the current CPU.
Current x86\_get\_pmu() use the global 'pmu', which will be broken on a
hybrid platform. Modify it to apply the 'pmu' of the specific CPU.
Initialize the per-CPU 'pmu' variable with the global 'pmu'. There is
nothing changed for the non-hybrid platforms.
The is\_x86\_event() will be updated in the later patch ("perf/x86:
Register hybrid PMUs") for hybrid platforms. For the non-hybrid
platforms, nothing is changed here.

net: ll\_temac: Add memory-barriers for TX BD access
[ Upstream commit 28d9fab458b16bcd83f9dd07ede3d585c3e1a69e ]
Add a couple of memory-barriers to ensure correct ordering of read/write
access to TX BDs.
In xmit\_done, we should ensure that reading the additional BD fields are
only done after STS\_CTRL\_APP0\_CMPLT bit is set.
When xmit\_done marks the BD as free by setting APP0=0, we need to ensure
that the other BD fields are reset first, so we avoid racing with the xmit
path, which writes to the same fields.
Finally, making sure to read APP0 of next BD after the current BD, ensures
that we see all available buffers.

PCI: Add AMD RS690 quirk to enable 64-bit DMA
[ Upstream commit cacf994a91d3a55c0c2f853d6429cd7b86113915 ]
Although the AMD RS690 chipset has 64-bit DMA support, BIOS implementations
sometimes fail to configure the memory limit registers correctly.
The Acer F690GVM mainboard uses this chipset and a Marvell 88E8056 NIC. The
sky2 driver programs the NIC to use 64-bit DMA, which will not work:
sky2 0000:02:00.0: error interrupt status=0x8
sky2 0000:02:00.0 eth0: tx timeout
sky2 0000:02:00.0 eth0: transmit ring 0 .. 22 report=0 done=0
Other drivers required by this mainboard either don't support 64-bit DMA,
or have it disabled using driver specific quirks. For example, the ahci
driver has quirks to enable or disable 64-bit DMA depending on the BIOS
version (see ahci\_sb600\_enable\_64bit() in ahci.c). This ahci quirk matches
against the SB600 SATA controller, but the real issue is almost certainly
with the RS690 PCI host that it was commonly attached to.
To avoid this issue in all drivers with 64-bit DMA support, fix the
configuration of the PCI host. If the kernel is aware of physical memory
above 4GB, but the BIOS never configured the PCI host with this
information, update the registers with our values.

net: qed: Fix memcpy() overflow of qed\_dcbx\_params()
[ Upstream commit 1c200f832e14420fa770193f9871f4ce2df00d07 ]
The source (&dcbx\_info->operational.params) and dest
(&p\_hwfn->p\_dcbx\_info->set.config.params) are both struct qed\_dcbx\_params
(560 bytes), not struct qed\_dcbx\_admin\_params (564 bytes), which is used
as the memcpy() size.
However it seems that struct qed\_dcbx\_operational\_params
(dcbx\_info->operational)'s layout matches struct qed\_dcbx\_admin\_params
(p\_hwfn->p\_dcbx\_info->set.config)'s 4 byte difference (3 padding, 1 byte
for "valid").
On the assumption that the size is wrong (rather than the source structure
type), adjust the memcpy() size argument to be 4 bytes smaller and add
a BUILD\_BUG\_ON() to validate any changes to the structure sizes.

qmi\_wwan: Do not call netif\_rx from rx\_fixup
[ Upstream commit 057d49334c02a79af81c30a8d240e641bd6f1741 ]
When the QMI\_WWAN\_FLAG\_PASS\_THROUGH is set, netif\_rx() is called from
qmi\_wwan\_rx\_fixup(). When the call to netif\_rx() is successful (which is
most of the time), usbnet\_skb\_return() is called (from rx\_process()).
usbnet\_skb\_return() will then call netif\_rx() a second time for the same
skb.
Simplify the code and avoid the redundant netif\_rx() call by changing
qmi\_wwan\_rx\_fixup() to always return 1 when QMI\_WWAN\_FLAG\_PASS\_THROUGH
is set. We then leave it up to the existing infrastructure to call
netif\_rx().

bpf, selftests: Adjust few selftest outcomes wrt unreachable code
[ Upstream commit 973377ffe8148180b2651825b92ae91988141b05 ]
In almost all cases from test\_verifier that have been changed in here, we've
had an unreachable path with a load from a register which has an invalid
address on purpose. This was basically to make sure that we never walk this
path and to have the verifier complain if it would otherwise. Change it to
match on the right error for unprivileged given we now test these paths
under speculative execution.
There's one case where we match on exact # of insns\_processed. Due to the
extra path, this will of course mismatch on unprivileged. Thus, restrict the
test->insn\_processed check to privileged-only.
In one other case, we result in a 'pointer comparison prohibited' error. This
is similarly due to verifying an 'invalid' branch where we end up with a value
pointer on one side of the comparison.

Ser pointer is netdev private\_data, so after free\_netdev()
this pointer goes away with unputted tty reference. So, fix
it by adding tty\_kref\_put() before freeing netdev.

thread to re-connect an change sk->sk\_txhash under us.
There is no serious impact, but we can use READ\_ONCE()/WRITE\_ONCE()
pair to document the race.

Both functions are known to be racy when reading inet\_num
as we do not want to grab locks for the common case the socket
has been bound already. The race is resolved in inet\_autobind()
by reading again inet\_num under the socket lock.

cfg80211: call cfg80211\_leave\_ocb when switching away from OCB
[ Upstream commit a64b6a25dd9f984ed05fade603a00e2eae787d2f ]
If the userland switches back-and-forth between NL80211\_IFTYPE\_OCB and
NL80211\_IFTYPE\_ADHOC via send\_msg(NL80211\_CMD\_SET\_INTERFACE), there is a
chance where the cleanup cfg80211\_leave\_ocb() is not called. This leads
to initialization of in-use memory (e.g. init u.ibss while in-use by
u.ocb) due to a shared struct/union within ieee80211\_sub\_if\_data:
struct ieee80211\_sub\_if\_data {
...
union {
struct ieee80211\_if\_ap ap;
struct ieee80211\_if\_vlan vlan;
struct ieee80211\_if\_managed mgd;
struct ieee80211\_if\_ibss ibss; // <- shares address
struct ieee80211\_if\_mesh mesh;
struct ieee80211\_if\_ocb ocb; // <- shares address
struct ieee80211\_if\_mntr mntr;
struct ieee80211\_if\_nan nan;
} u;
...
}
Therefore add handling of otype == NL80211\_IFTYPE\_OCB, during
cfg80211\_change\_iface() to perform cleanup when leaving OCB mode.

mac80211\_hwsim: drop pending frames on stop
[ Upstream commit bd18de517923903a177508fc8813f44e717b1c00 ]
Syzbot reports that we may be able to get into a situation where
mac80211 has pending ACK frames on shutdown with hwsim. It appears
that the reason for this is that syzbot uses the wmediumd hooks to
intercept/injection frames, and may shut down hwsim, removing the
radio(s), while frames are pending in the air simulation.
Clean out the pending queue when the interface is stopped, after
this the frames can't be reported back to mac80211 properly anyway.

mac80211: remove warning in ieee80211\_get\_sband()
[ Upstream commit 0ee4d55534f82a0624701d0bb9fc2304d4529086 ]
Syzbot reports that it's possible to hit this from userspace,
by trying to add a station before any other connection setup
has been done. Instead of trying to catch this in some other
way simply remove the warning, that will appropriately reject
the call from userspace.

While the descriptor ID is stored in a 32-bit field in the hardware

perf/x86/intel/lbr: Zero the xstate buffer on allocation
[ Upstream commit 7f049fbdd57f6ea71dc741d903c19c73b2f70950 ]
XRSTORS requires a valid xstate buffer to work correctly. XSAVES does not
guarantee to write a fully valid buffer according to the SDM:
"XSAVES does not write to any parts of the XSAVE header other than the
XSTATE\_BV and XCOMP\_BV fields."
XRSTORS triggers a #GP:
"If bytes 63:16 of the XSAVE header are not all zero."
It's dubious at best how this can work at all when the buffer is not zeroed
before use.
Allocate the buffers with \_\_GFP\_ZERO to prevent XRSTORS failure.

psi: Fix psi state corruption when schedule() races with cgroup move
commit d583d360a620e6229422b3455d0be082b8255f5e upstream.
4117cebf1a9f ("psi: Optimize task switch inside shared cgroups")
introduced a race condition that corrupts internal psi state. This
manifests as kernel warnings, sometimes followed by bogusly high IO
pressure:
psi: task underflow! cpu=1 t=2 tasks=[0 0 0 0] clear=c set=0
(schedule() decreasing RUNNING and ONCPU, both of which are 0)
psi: incosistent task state! task=2412744:systemd cpu=17 psi\_flags=e clear=3 set=0
(cgroup\_move\_task() clearing MEMSTALL and IOWAIT, but task is MEMSTALL | RUNNING | ONCPU)
What the offending commit does is batch the two psi callbacks in
schedule() to reduce the number of cgroup tree updates. When prev is
deactivated and removed from the runqueue, nothing is done in psi at
first; when the task switch completes, TSK\_RUNNING and TSK\_IOWAIT are
updated along with TSK\_ONCPU.
However, the deactivation and the task switch inside schedule() aren't
atomic: pick\_next\_task() may drop the rq lock for load balancing. When
this happens, cgroup\_move\_task() can run after the task has been
physically dequeued, but the psi updates are still pending. Since it
looks at the task's scheduler state, it doesn't move everything to the
new cgroup that the task switch that follows is about to clear from
it. cgroup\_move\_task() will leak the TSK\_RUNNING count in the old
cgroup, and psi\_sched\_switch() will underflow it in the new cgroup.
A similar thing can happen for iowait. TSK\_IOWAIT is usually set when
a p->in\_iowait task is dequeued, but again this update is deferred to
the switch. cgroup\_move\_task() can see an unqueued p->in\_iowait task
and move a non-existent TSK\_IOWAIT. This results in the inconsistent
task state warning, as well as a counter underflow that will result in
permanent IO ghost pressure being reported.
Fix this bug by making cgroup\_move\_task() use task->psi\_flags instead
of looking at the potentially mismatching scheduler state.
[ We used the scheduler state historically in order to not rely on
task->psi\_flags for anything but debugging. But that ship has sailed
anyway, and this is simpler and more robust.
We previously already batched TSK\_ONCPU clearing with the
TSK\_RUNNING update inside the deactivation call from schedule(). But
that ordering was safe and didn't result in TSK\_ONCPU corruption:
unlike most places in the scheduler, cgroup\_move\_task() only checked
task\_current() and handled TSK\_ONCPU if the task was still queued. ]

This adds a local sg\_copy\_to\_buffer which makes usage of io versions of memcpy

ARM: 9081/1: fix gcc-10 thumb2-kernel regression
commit dad7b9896a5dbac5da8275d5a6147c65c81fb5f2 upstream.
When building the kernel wtih gcc-10 or higher using the
CONFIG\_CC\_OPTIMIZE\_FOR\_PERFORMANCE=y flag, the compiler picks a slightly
different set of registers for the inline assembly in cpu\_init() that
subsequently results in a corrupt kernel stack as well as remaining in
FIQ mode. If a banked register is used for the last argument, the wrong
version of that register gets loaded into CPSR\_c. When building in Arm
mode, the arguments are passed as immediate values and the bug cannot
happen.
This got introduced when Daniel reworked the FIQ handling and was
technically always broken, but happened to work with both clang and gcc
before gcc-10 as long as they picked one of the lower registers.
This is probably an indication that still very few people build the
kernel in Thumb2 mode.
Marek pointed out the problem on IRC, Arnd narrowed it down to this
inline assembly and Russell pinpointed the exact bug.
Change the constraints to force the final mode switch to use a non-banked
register for the argument to ensure that the correct constant gets loaded.
Another alternative would be to always use registers for the constant
arguments to avoid the #ifdef that has now become more complex.

commit 1815d9c86e3090477fbde066ff314a7e9721ee0f upstream.
While checking the master status of the DRM file in
drm\_is\_current\_master(), the device's master mutex should be
held. Without the mutex, the pointer fpriv->master may be freed
concurrently by another process calling drm\_setmaster\_ioctl(). This
could lead to use-after-free errors when the pointer is subsequently
dereferenced in drm\_lease\_owner().
The callers of drm\_is\_current\_master() from drm\_auth.c hold the
device's master mutex, but external callers do not. Hence, we implement
drm\_is\_current\_master\_locked() to be used within drm\_auth.c, and
modify drm\_is\_current\_master() to grab the device's master mutex
before checking the master status.

module: limit enabling module.sig\_enforce
[ Upstream commit 0c18f29aae7ce3dadd26d8ee3505d07cc982df75 ]
Irrespective as to whether CONFIG\_MODULE\_SIG is configured, specifying
"module.sig\_enforce=1" on the boot command line sets "sig\_enforce".
Only allow "sig\_enforce" to be set when CONFIG\_MODULE\_SIG is configured.
This patch makes the presence of /sys/module/module/parameters/sig\_enforce

Subject: CVE-2021-35039: Linux kernel loading unsigned kernel modules via
 init_module syscall

Vulnerability: Linux Kernel loading unsigned kernel modules via
init_module syscall

Fixes: 7c9bc0983f89 ("ima: check signature enforcement against cmdline
param instead of CONFIG")

Commit:  0c18f29aae7c ("module: limit enabling module.sig_enforce")

CVE:  CVE-2021-35039

Details:
The IMA arch specific policy rules, when enabled on x86, arm or powerpc,
kernels with IMA_APPRAISE_REQUIRE_MODULE_SIGS configured, or systems
with custom IMA policies containing a similar module rule, require all
kernel modules to be signed. IMA, currently, only verifies kernel module
signatures loaded via finit_module and relies on CONFIG_MODULE_SIG to
verify kernel modules signatures loaded via init_module. The patch
addresses the situation where MODULE_SIG is not enabled, but
"module.sig_enforce=1" is specified on the boot command line.

Affected Kernel Versions: 4.15 through 5.12

Subject: CVE-2021-35039: Linux kernel loading unsigned kernel modules via
 init_module syscall

Vulnerability: Linux Kernel loading unsigned kernel modules via
init_module syscall

Fixes: 7c9bc0983f89 ("ima: check signature enforcement against cmdline
param instead of CONFIG")

Commit:  0c18f29aae7c ("module: limit enabling module.sig_enforce")

CVE:  CVE-2021-35039

Details:
The IMA arch specific policy rules, when enabled on x86, arm or powerpc,
kernels with IMA_APPRAISE_REQUIRE_MODULE_SIGS configured, or systems
with custom IMA policies containing a similar module rule, require all
kernel modules to be signed. IMA, currently, only verifies kernel module
signatures loaded via finit_module and relies on CONFIG_MODULE_SIG to
verify kernel modules signatures loaded via init_module. The patch
addresses the situation where MODULE_SIG is not enabled, but
"module.sig_enforce=1" is specified on the boot command line.

Affected Kernel Versions: 4.15 through 5.12
