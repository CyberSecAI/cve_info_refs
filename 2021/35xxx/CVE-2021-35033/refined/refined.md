{
  "CVE-2021-35033": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a hardcoded default password present in a configuration file within the firmware (/etc/uci_defconfig/system), used for the UART port on the PCB board.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use of hard-coded credentials",
      "Improper access control"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can gain root access to the affected device.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access by physically dismantling the device and connecting via USB-to-UART cable.",
      "Remote access if the remote assistance feature was enabled by an authenticated user."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "For physical access: ability to dismantle the device and connect a USB-to-UART cable. For remote access: an authenticated user enabling the remote assistance feature.",
    "Affected products": [
      "Zyxel NBG6818",
      "Zyxel NBG7815",
      "Zyxel WSQ20",
      "Zyxel WSQ50",
      "Zyxel WSQ60",
      "Zyxel WSR30"
    ],
     "Additional details": "The default password varies by model, and is present in the /etc/uci_defconfig/system file. For example, the NBG6818 has a password 'nbg6818@2019'."
