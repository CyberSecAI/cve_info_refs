Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35200:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization or encoding within the `FDSQueryService` of the Netscout nGeniusONE application, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores the malicious script within its database. When a user with high privileges views data associated with the injected script, the script is executed within their browser context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of a high-privilege user.
- **Account Hijacking/Data Theft:** The injected script can potentially be used to perform malicious actions such as session hijacking, account takeover, or data exfiltration, depending on the user's privileges.
- **System Compromise:** In a worst-case scenario, a compromised high-privileged user account could provide further access to the server or other connected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable `nGeniusONE` application.
- **High Privileged Account**: The attacker requires a high-privileged user account to inject the malicious script through the `FDSQueryService`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privileged Access:** To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have a high-privileged user account on the nGeniusONE system.
- **Knowledge of the FDSQueryService**: The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint or function within `FDSQueryService`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the FDSQueryService endpoint of `nGeniusONE` version 6.3.0 build 1196
- The vulnerability requires a high-privileged user to store the malicious payload in the system.
- The provided fix is patch `6.3.0 P5 B1411`.
- This analysis provides more details than the basic CVE description, outlining the specific endpoint, the required privileges, and the attack complexity.
