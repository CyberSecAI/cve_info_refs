{
  "CVE-2021-35489": {
    "status": "relevant",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `strcpy` function in `ifaces.c` does not perform bounds checking when copying data, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow",
		"Lack of bounds checking"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with root privileges by providing a malicious configuration file.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Exploiting a vulnerable configuration file processed by `iptraf-ng`"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to supply or modify a configuration file used by `iptraf-ng`, which could be achieved by either controlling the system or tricking the system user into using malicious settings.",
        "additional_info": "The provided analysis includes a step-by-step guide for reproducing the vulnerability, a crashing PoC using AFL++, and an exploit demonstration."
