- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input when storing notes to various models (Groups, Roles, etc.).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with permissions to modify the notes of a vulnerable model can inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the context of other users' sessions when they view the notes. This can lead to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with the necessary permissions to edit notes in Zammad can inject malicious JavaScript code in the notes section of models like Groups, Roles, etc.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires permissions to store/edit notes within the Zammad application (admin permissions may be required for some models).
