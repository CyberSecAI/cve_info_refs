The provided content relates to CVE-2021-35284.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection in the `get_user()` function within the `function.php` file. The function directly incorporates user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The `get_user()` function constructs the SQL query by concatenating the `$where` parameter directly, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize or validate the input received from the user before using it to construct a database query.
- **Direct Query Execution:** The code utilizes `mysql_query` to execute the constructed query directly.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands, allowing them to bypass authentication.
- Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information such as user credentials or other database records.
- Attackers can modify or delete data.
- In the provided example, the attacker uses `sleep(20)` to demonstrate a time-based SQL injection which can be used for data exfiltration or denial of service attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker manipulates the `username` and `password` parameters in the login form to inject malicious SQL code within the `where` clause of the query executed by `get_user()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the login page and modify the values of username and password fields.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
