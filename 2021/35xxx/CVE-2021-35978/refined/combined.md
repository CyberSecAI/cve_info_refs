## What Is Industrial IoT (IIoT)?

Developing and deploying a wireless application requires the right products for the right use case. Especially when it comes to the [industrial IoT](/blog/post/what-is-industrial-iot-definition-use-cases) – where devices can be subjected to temperature extremes, moisture, vibration and other environmental factors. Digi specializes in serving the demanding applications in the Industrial IoT (IIoT) market with ruggedized cellular solutions and supporting services.

[IIoT applications](/solutions/by-application) run the gamut from outdoor [digital signage](/solutions/by-application/digital-signage) to [water/wastewater management](/solutions/by-industry/smart-cities/water-wastewater), [smart city lighting](/solutions/by-industry/smart-cities/intelligent-lighting-controls), [municipal transit](/solutions/by-application/public-transit), [traffic management](/solutions/by-application/traffic-management), [precision agriculture](/solutions/by-industry/industrial/precision-agriculture), [utilities and metering](/solutions/by-industry/energy/commercial-industrial-metering), [manufacturing automation](/solutions/by-industry/industrial/manufacturing-automation) and remote industrial monitoring.

Hardened, high-performance Digi IoT solutions for the industrial space include [industrial cellular routers](/products/networking/cellular-routers/industrial), [transportation cellular routers](/products/networking/cellular-routers/transportation) as well as [wireless SOMs](/products/embedded-systems/digi-connectcore/system-on-modules), [embedded RF modules](/products/embedded-systems/digi-xbee/rf-modules) and [Digi Remote Manager](/products/iot-software-services/digi-remote-manager) - the remote device management platform to monitor and manage device networks of any size and perform out-of-band management from a desktop or mobile device.

[Download the Industrial IoT Solutions Brochure](/resources/library/solution-briefs/process-control-industry-brochure)

[Remote Device Management](/products/iot-software-services/digi-remote-manager)

For any IoT device deployment of more than a few devices, teams deploying IoT solutions need a remote management system to support configuration, monitoring, security, firmware updates, troubleshooting and out-of-band management. Digi RM is the command center for your device network, providing the tools for configuring and managing your devices.

[IoT Devices](/products)

The need for IoT products is on a growth trajectory, encompassing everything from wireless IoT solutions such as embedded system-on-modules and RF modules to cellular routers and gateways. Digi is a leading provider of IoT products and solutions supporting industries from retail and banking to medical, transportation and remote industrial applications.

[IoT Services](/products/iot-software-services)

Defining the needs for wireless IoT solutions is a complex process, as are the subsequent phases, which include prototyping, designing, certifying, configuring and deploying your IoT application. Digi provides IoT services to support the complete lifecycle of product ideation, development, and management of IoT embedded designs as well as deployment of packaged solutions.

### Solutions for Connected Enterprises

## Technology is ever changing, and Digi is on the cutting edge, delivering the solutions you need to solve problems, work smarter, connect faster and grow.

### Private LTE Based on CBRS

With coverage or capacity issues sometimes limiting the availability of public LTE or Wi-Fi
networks, organizations in the U.S. are increasingly turning to CBRS to meet their connectivity
needs.

[Digi is ready to help you deploy](/solutions/by-technology/private-lte-based-on-cbrs)

"Digi TX64 is the ideal choice for TriMet, because of its durability, performance, and customizability. We love that we can customize the router through Digi Advanced Linux and custom Python apps to integrate it easily with our CAD/AVL, and other vehicle-based systems. Digi Remote Manager was another major reason for our choice, since we can manage device configurations on across TriMet’s vehicle fleet from a single pane of glass."
