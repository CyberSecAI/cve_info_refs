**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable System Data Manager (SDM600) is installed and the ability to modify backup files.
- Low attack complexity and low privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
- The affected versions include SDM600 versions prior to 1.2 FP2 HF6 (Build Nr. 1.2.14002.257).
