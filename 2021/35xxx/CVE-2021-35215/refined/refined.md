Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-35215

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted data within the `ActionPluginBaseView` class in SolarWinds Orion Platform. The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The primary vulnerability is the insecure deserialization of untrusted data. This allows an attacker to manipulate the data stream and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate user-supplied data before deserialization, enabling the exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected server.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The code execution occurs in the context of the `NETWORK SERVICE` account, potentially leading to further privilege escalation and system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **Data Injection:** The attacker injects malicious serialized data, leveraging the insecure deserialization flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the affected SolarWinds Orion Platform instance.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects SolarWinds Orion Platform versions 2020.2.5 and earlier.
*   SolarWinds has released version 2020.2.6 to address this issue.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Jangggggg working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
