# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @AlexTugarev **[AlexTugarev](/AlexTugarev)** commented [Jan 13, 2021](#issue-784902746) • edited Loading

This PR closes an open redirect issue. AFAIK this is problem if an attacker would fake a Gitpod-like website and make people use links with redirects to it. The fake website could potentially ask user to enter sensitive information.

Allowing for Gitpod homepage URLs comes in parallel via [#2692](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/2692). ✔️

# how to test

0. log in & log out without errors.
1. should login and start a workspace: <http://at-returnto.staging.gitpod-dev.com/api/login?host=github.com&returnTo=http://at-returnto.staging.gitpod-dev.com/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/django-locallibrary-tutorial>
2. log out.
3. should open the dashboard: <http://at-returnto.staging.gitpod-dev.com/api/login?host=github.com&returnTo=https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/2879>

This PR closes an open redirect issue. AFAIK this is problem if an attacker would fake a Gitpod-like website and make people use links with redirects to it. The fake website could potentially ask user to enter sensitive information.

Allowing for Gitpod homepage URLs comes in parallel via [#2692](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/2692). ✔️

# how to test

0. log in & log out without errors.
1. should login and start a workspace: <http://at-returnto.staging.gitpod-dev.com/api/login?host=github.com&returnTo=http://at-returnto.staging.gitpod-dev.com/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/django-locallibrary-tutorial>
2. log out.
3. should open the dashboard: <http://at-returnto.staging.gitpod-dev.com/api/login?host=github.com&returnTo=https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/2879>

Gitpod Enterprise
## [Improved cost efficiency for Super Large workspace classes for Gitpod Enterprise](/changelog/super-large-workspace-class-cost-efficiency)

We’re excited to share that the **3XLarge and 4XLarge workspace classes** in Gitpod Enterprise are now significantly more cost-efficient!

**What’s new?**
Your organization can now run **three 3XLarge workspaces** on a single EC2 instance, or **one 3X Large and one 4XLarge workspace** on a single EC2 instance. This change can reduce AWS EC2 costs if your organization relies on these workspace classes. Additionally, it means less time spent waiting for workspace starts, because there will be less EC2 instance scale-ups.

**How did we achieve this?**

* Reduced vCPU for 3XLarge from **32 to 30 vCPU**.
* Reduced vCPU for 4XLarge from **64 to 60 vCPU**.

**What does this mean for your developers?**
Developers will now have slightly less vCPU for these workspace classes. They can monitor this adjustment using tools like `gp top`.

## [Configurable Concurrent Workspace Limits](/changelog/concurrent-workspace-limits)

Organization owners can now configure the maximum number of workspaces that users can run simultaneously. This setting is available in the organization’s policy settings.

**What’s included:**

* Default limits of 4 workspaces for free organizations and 16 for paid organizations (Gitpod Cloud) or 16 for all organizations (Gitpod Enterprise)
* Custom limits can be set to any non-negative integer (setting to 0 uses the default limit)
* Enterprise customers can configure limits beyond the default 16 concurrent workspaces

## [Introducing Gitpod Flex SSO](/changelog/gitpod-flex-sso)

We’re excited to announce that Gitpod Flex now supports Single Sign-On (SSO), making it easier than ever to manage access for your team. With SSO, your team can log in using their existing accounts with trusted Identity Providers like Okta, Azure AD, or Google using OpenID Connect (OIDC) integration.

This feature simplifies authentication by eliminating the need for separate credentials, enhances security by centralizing user management, and streamlines access across your organization. As an admin, you can easily set up SSO in your organization’s settings using your IdP credentials and manage access with just a few clicks.

Learn how to set up SSO in our [documentation](/docs/flex/sso).

## [Improved XLarge workspace class for Gitpod Enterprise](/changelog/xlarge-workspace-class-cost-efficiency)

We’re excited to share that the **XLarge workspace class** in Gitpod Enterprise is now significantly more cost-efficient!

**What’s new?**
Your organization can now run **two XLarge workspaces** on a single EC2 instance instead of just one. This change can greatly reduce AWS EC2 costs if you rely on XLarge workspaces. Additionally, it means less time spent waiting for workspace starts, because there will be less EC2 instance scale-ups.

**How did we achieve this?**

* Reduced memory allocation for internal services.
* Reduced XLarge workspace memory from **30Gi to 27Gi**.

**What does this mean for your developers?**
Developers using the XLarge workspace class will now have **27Gi of memory**, down from 30Gi. They can monitor this adjustment using tools like `gp top`.

Gitpod Flex now supports secrets and environment variables. Securely store and inject sensitive data such as API keys and access credentials into your development environment. Secrets are encrypted using AES256-GCM and stored securely. Only environments launched from an associated project can access it’s secrets.

Highlights:

* **Environment Variables**: Inject secrets as environment variables.
* **Files**: Secrets can be mounted as files for complex structures e.g. JSON.

**What’s the benefit of files?** Files offer better security by avoiding issues like process visibility, crash logging leaks, and unintentional inheritance by child processes.

Gitpod ClassicGitpod Enterprise
## [Activity based prebuilds](/changelog/activity-based-prebuilds)

Triggers for prebuilds are changing from external webhook events to internal workspace creation events emitted within Gitpod. This change reduces the cost of prebuilds by eliminating redundant prebuilds for repositories that have been set up with prebuilds but where workspaces are not being actively created. This removes the requirement for webhook installation, making enabling prebuilds easier and faster, whilst also reducing architectural and network complexity for Gitpod Enterprise customers with privately networked installations. Existing prebuild settings such as the commit interval, branch filter and branch name pattern will still take effect.

Existing prebuilds will continue to use webhook triggering, so no action is required. However, new repository prebuilds settings will use this new behavior by default.

To convert any existing repository prebuild settings to remove webhook triggering and use activity-based prebuilds:

1. Disable prebuilds for each repository setting
2. Delete any repository webhook connections to Gitpod
3. Enable prebuilds for each repository setting

For more details, refer to the [documentation on prebuilds](/docs/configure/repositories/prebuilds).

## [Audit logs for Gitpod Enterprise](/changelog/enterprise-audit-logs)

Gitpod Enterprise customers now have access to audit logs to improve proactive monitoring of development environments for unexpected behaviors or for post-incident forensics or analysis.

* Audit logs are stored in a data store within the Gitpod instance for 90 days and can be retrieved via API by users with the “owner” role.
* Audit events are also forwarded to application logs. Gitpod Enterprise customers can access application logs directly from CloudWatch.

Gitpod logs audit events for every internal API call which including the following examples:

1. Workspace start, stop, delete
2. Update to members of organizations
3. Changes to organization policy settings

Each audit event includes a unique instance id, timestamp, the API action performed, the actor who performed the action and any arguments. An example:

### Frequently asked questions

**Are audit logs available in the dashboard?**

Audit logs are only available programmatically either through the API or directly from logs.

**Can the audit log retention be configured?**

Audit logs are retained within Gitpod for 90 days now. Currently, this value cannot be configured yet!

**Are events tracked within the development environment itself?**

Gitpod audit logs only apply to the Gitpod platform which includes orchestration and administration of workspaces, but does not extend to actions taken within workspaces.

**Do audit logs track changes to environment configurations?**

Changes to any organization settings or policies are shown in logs. Changes to the `.gitpod.yml` definitions are kept in source control history in your SCM.

## [Limit available workspace classes and editors](/changelog/limit-available-workspace-classes-and-editors)

We’ve expanded organization policies to offer more control over available workspace classes and editors.

**Repository workspace class policy**: Besides restricting workspace classes for your organization, you can now limit available classes or set a default class for each repository. This can prevent unexpected costs from accidental overuse, but also set a default workspace class for repositories that need a larger class to run better.

**Organization and repository editor policy**: Organization owners can now limit the available editors to all organization members, and then select which editors are available for each repository within your organization. This can offer consistent editor options, as well as prevent use of unsupported editors for your projects.

## [Simplified repository management](/changelog/simplified-repository-management)

We’ve simplified how you configure repositories in Gitpod by replacing projects with repository settings, and introduced a new prebuilds activity page that aggregates all prebuilds across all repositories in your organization in a single view.

The new [repositories](https://gitpod.io/repositories) page is using a compact list for all the repositories you’ve added to your organization, and you can now glance over the list and quickly filter for repositories that have prebuilds enabled. Repository settings also come with an intuitive settings layout, following the layout of other settings in Gitpod.

The organization-wide [prebuilds](https://gitpod.io/prebuilds) page now lists all prebuilds that are happening in your organization and lets you filter prebuilds for a specific repository, as well as filter by status.

Both pages are accessible to all organization members, except the ones with [collaborator](/changelog/collaborator-role-for-restricted-access-to-gitpod) access. Learn more in our [documentation](/docs/configure/repositories).

## [Take Gitpod to your local command line](/changelog/gitpod-cli)

Workspaces that include all the tools developers need to start work and become [ready-to-code](https://www.gitpod.io/ready-to-code) are even more accessible and flexible, with the new Gitpod CLI for personal workspace management.

For **developers** you can now start and manage workspaces directly from your terminal, composing with your other favorite command-line utilities, and writing custom scripts.

For **platform engineers** you can now incorporate the CLI into your own internal developer platform to bring ready-to-code workspaces to your developers through deeper integrations.

> **Please note:** The Gitpod CLI is an additional CLI to the [existing CLI](/docs/configure/workspaces/gitpod-cli) (`gp`) that is available in all Gitpod workspaces. In future these two experiences will be aligned.

## Getting Started

To get started, install the CLI with the following command:

![language icon](/svg/docs/language.svg)
![language icon](/svg/docs/language-dark.svg)
bash

Copy code
Copy copied
```
brew install gitpod-io/tap/gitpod
```

Everything installed? Let’s login and start using the CLI to create and manage workspaces.

### Login to your Gitpod host

Using browser-based or token-based authentication:

1. `gitpod login` to login to Gitpod.
2. `gitpod login --host="yourcompany.gitpod.cloud"` for [Gitpod Enterprise](/contact/enterprise-self-serve).
3. `gitpod login --token <access-token>` to authenticate with an [Access Token](/docs/configure/user-settings/access-tokens).

> **Note:** Access tokens are generated from your User Settings in the Gitpod dashboard.

> **Tip:** Use `gitpod whoami` to see your authenticated organization, host, etc.

### Create and open a workspace in your editor

> **Tip:** Use `--editor` to override your default editor selection. Use `gitpod workspace list-editors` to see a list of possible editor options.

### Managing workspaces

There’s a lot more you can do with the Gitpod CLI including listing and deleting workspaces. We suggest you explore the CLI using the help pages. Start by typing `gitpod` to start exploring.

See [Gitpod CLI](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) for more.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Can the CLI be used in automation?** Yes. You can install and use the Gitpod CLI in CI pipelines, bash scripts or other automation by logging in via access token based authentication.

**Does this mean Gitpod now has two CLIs?** Gitpod will continue to support the `gp` CLI within Gitpod workspaces alongside this new Gitpod CLI. The `gp` CLI will now be referred to as the “workspace CLI”. We intend to merge these two CLIs in future, but not today.

**How does this new Gitpod CLI relate to the existing ‘Local Companion’?** The Local Companion tool will now no longer be supported by Gitpod. Since we originally announced the Local Companion, we have since introduced other features which allow you to achieve similar behaviors previously offered by the Local Companion. See the [Local Companion documentation](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/local-companion) for more.

**Is the CLI compatible with all Gitpod IDEs and editors?** Yes. The CLI allows you to open workspaces directly through SSH, the [Browser Terminal](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/browser-terminal), VS Code Desktop and Browser, or with any of the JetBrains IDEs.

## [You can now specify the exact SCM hosts in your Gitpod browser extension settings](/changelog/browser-extension-host-update)

We recently updated the browser extension to [allow self-hosted](/changelog/browser-extension-v2) source control management (SCM) like Bitbucket and GitLab. We implemented this change by updating the browser extension to run on all hosts, which caused concern for some of our users. We heard your feedback, and have now updated the extension so that you can customize the hosts where the Gitpod browser extension should run. The latest browser extension version enables (by default) the following hosts: `github.com`, `gitlab.com` and `bitbucket.org`. You can now also to opt-in to enable additional hosts, such as a self-hosted SCM. Here’s what you need to know:

1. **Users who already have the extension installed** - Any previously allowed hosts will persist, including those who allowed all websites. You can now update the opt-in hosts in your browser extension settings.
2. **Users who do not have the extension installed** - Install the extension as normal, and opt-in to enable any relevant SCM hosts, if self-hosted support is required.

## [Blazing fast workspace starts are now easier than ever, with simplified default settings for prebuilds](/changelog/simplified-prebuilds-defaults)

Enabling prebuilds to increase the performance of workspace starts should be simple. With prebuilds enabled you unlock more of the developer velocity potential of Cloud Development Environments for your organization.

To make prebuilds simpler and easier to use, we’ve drastically simplified the default prebuild settings. We’ve removed the previous settings for “incremental prebuilds”, “use last successful prebuild” and “cancel prebuild on outdated commits” and instead created a set of simpler and more intuitive defaults that just work™.

If you do need more advanced fine-tuning of your prebuild settings, you can also now filter when your prebuilds are triggered across all of your git providers (GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket) through project settings.

### Simplified default prebuild settings

The previous prebuild settings for “incremental prebuilds”, “use last successful prebuild” and “cancel prebuild on outdated commits” have now been removed and simplified. By default, all prebuilds:

1. Skip `20` commits by default (if no previous setting was applied)
2. Search the past 100 commits for a successful prebuild to base a workspace on
3. No longer prevent users from accessing workspaces if a prebuild is executing

These settings should work well for most projects out-of-the-box, without the need to apply additional filters. By increasing the [Commit Interval](/docs/configure/repositories/prebuilds#commit-interval) you can balance freshness of prebuilds against the frequency of their execution.

**Note:** These setting defaults apply to all new and existing projects automatically.

### Branch filters for prebuilds on project settings

The improved prebuild defaults should work well for most projects. However, if your project requires more fine-tuning of when prebuilds are triggered, the following prebuild settings are now available for all git integrations:

1. All branches (the default setting)
2. Default branch only (e.g. main)
3. Only the branches specified (via glob pattern)

Previously only the [GitHub integration](/docs/integrations/github) could filter prebuilds—configured through the `.gitpod.yml`. All other providers, e.g. ([GitLab](/docs/integrations/gitlab) and [Bitbucket](/docs/integrations/bitbucket)) ran prebuilds on every commit push, with limited control.

> Prebuild settings in the `.gitpod.yml` are deprecated. All existing `.gitpod.yml` settings will apply until prebuilds are manually enabled in project settings.
>
>  See [configuring Prebuilds via .gitpod.yml](/docs/integrations/github-gitpod-yaml) for archived documentation.

### The way `init` tasks work is changing, here’s what you need to know:

When you open a workspace and Gitpod finds an existing prebuild for an older commit, Gitpod will start the workspace and then run the `init` steps from the `.gitpod.yml` again on top of the existing prebuild. Gitpod will only use prebuilds that have an identical `.gitpod.yml` as your current commit. This new behavior works best for you when your `init` steps:

1. Can be executed repeatedly, while always producing the same end-state in the file system for a given repository state.
2. Execute quickly when executed the second time (e.g. process changes incrementally).

## [Start workspaces faster with the Gitpod Browser Extension v2](/changelog/browser-extension-v2)

The Gitpod browser extension has now been updated with the following changes:

1. **Start new workspaces faster** - To save time, the default browser extension action will open your workspaces using either your preferences for the repository, or your user settings. To override this behavior and choose your settings manually, you can use the *“Open with options…”* secondary option on the Gitpod button.
2. **Support for Self-Hosted Bitbucket and GitLab** - The browser extension is now compatible with both Bitbucket Datacenter and GitLab Self-hosted installations. No special steps are required: with the extension installed navigate to your Bitbucket or GitLab instance to see the Gitpod button appear within the interface.

**Getting Started**:

1. **Update or install the extension** - If you do not have the extension already installed, you can download it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-always-ready-to-co/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) or the [Firefox Add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gitpod/). If you have already had the extension installed your browser will automatically update it.
2. **Update the host setting (optional)** - For Gitpod Dedicated customers you can update your extension host setting by clicking the Gitpod icon in your browser bar and adding your Dedicated installation URL e.g. `your-company.gitpod.cloud`.

> **Important:** If you already had the browser extension installed, you may have to **re-enable the extension and accept new permissions**. Why? We removed host name restrictions to allow for self-hosted SCM support.

Gitpod ClassicGitpod Enterprise
## [Set a default Workspace Image for your Gitpod Organization](/changelog/organization-workspace-image-default)

With Gitpod you can now set a workspace image across your Organization. Previously, Gitpod would use the default `workspace-full` image when starting new workspace where there was no `image` setting added in the `.gitpod.yml`. Setting the default image is useful when you want to create a default workspace experience out-of-the-box for users in your Gitpod Organization without needing to create a `.gitpod.yml` in every repository.

**Please note:**

* The Organization workspace image setting is only a default and the workspace image can still be overwritten at the repository level by adding a workspace image reference into the repositories `.gitpod.yml` file.
* Authentication for the images is based on what the Gitpod installation can access. For Gitpod Cloud users, only public images are currently supported. For Gitpod Dedicated, the authentication is inherited from the installation. For instance, if you are using [ECR private registry](/docs/gitpod-dedicated/guides/use-private-ecr-repos-for-workspace-images#using-private-ecr-repositories-for-workspace-images) support that will work with the Organization setting.
* Only Organization owners can update the setting. All Organization members can view the setting.

**Getting started**

1. Ensure you are the Owner of the relevant Gitpod Organization (see [Members](https://gitpod.io/members)).
2. Navigate to the [Organization settings](https://gitpod.io/settings) page.
3. Navigate to the “Workspace Image” section to update the workspace image reference.
4. To test, start a new workspace based on a repository without a workspace image.

See [Workspace Image](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#workspace-image) for more.

With Gitpod you now have a new editor option for your workspaces: a terminal in the browser.

The terminal in the browser is good for full-time coding with Vim or Emacs, or simply making quick edits. A minimalistic, flexible experience to enhance your productivity using the tools that work best for you.

Customise the browser terminal with your own [dotfiles](/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles) or [connect via SSH](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/command-line) for added flexibility.

**Getting started**

* Select the terminal as the editor when you [start a workspace](https://gitpod.io/new) (try [gitpod.new](https://gitpod.new/) for a blank workspace)
* You can also Set the browser terminal as your default editor in your [user preferences](https://gitpod.io/user/account).

See [Browser Terminal](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/browser-terminal) for more.

## [Secretless Authorization (Using OIDC)](/changelog/secretless-authorization-%28using-oidc%29)

With Gitpod you can use OIDC to connect Gitpod workspaces to cloud providers or third parties such as AWS, Azure, GCP, or secret management services like Vault. Using OIDC integration eliminates the need to manually distribute access credentials, secrets, and other key material via other methods such as environment variables.
 Use `gp idp token` in any workspace (works in `.gitpod.yml` and with [prebuilds](/docs/configure/repositories/prebuilds)) to retrieve the workspace JWT token for exchange with the OIDC supporting 3rd party.

### Getting started

> The following shows how you can connect AWS to a Gitpod Cloud workspace. Steps can vary based on the 3rd party you are integrating and the domain of your Gitpod installation, see the documentation below for details.

1. Setup Gitpod as an AWS [Identity Provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create.html) (Using `https://api.gitpod.io/idp` as the Audience).
2. Create an AWS role with permissions to perform `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`.
3. Update your `.gitpod.yml` to exchange your workspace JWT token for an access token.

Gitpod ClassicGitpod Enterprise
## [Workspaces forward ports using the HTTPS protocol](/changelog/https-workspace-ports)

In Gitpod, you can now expose ports from your workspace running with HTTPS.

Previously, HTTPS ports exposed in a workspace would show a “port not found” page when accessed. You can configure the port protocol either in your [gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) or via the [Gitpod CLI](/docs/references/gitpod-cli).

## Configuring a port protocol in `.gitpod.yml`

To ensure a port is always configured with a specific protocol you can update the `ports` definition block in `.gitpod.yml` as below. Updating your `.gitpod.yml` is the preferred approach to using the `gp` CLI (see below), as the `.gitpod.yml` is declarative and ensures workspaces are created repeatably.

```
ports:
    - name: Frontend Application
      port: 3000
      protocol: https
```
## Dynamically updating port protocols with `gp`

You can dynamically change the protocol of a port using the `gp ports protocol` command.

For example, `gp ports protocol 3000:https` will change port `3000` to use `https`.

Or, `gp ports protocol 3000:http` will change port `3000` to use `http`. By default, ports are set as HTTP.

See [configuring ports](/docs/configure/workspaces/ports), [Gitpod CLI](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) [gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) for more.

![gitpod validate image banner](/images/changelog/gp-validate.webp)
Gitpod ClassicGitpod Enterprise
## [Validate your .gitpod.yml without committing ! 🤘](/changelog/validate-gitpod-yaml-without-commit)

**TL;DR;** - You can now validate a Gitpod configuration—both the `.gitpod.yml` and the workspace image—by running `gp validate` without needing to restart, leave your workspace, or commit your configuration.

* With `gp validate` can now validate a configuration within the workspace without committing. This works in a very similar way to a regular Gitpod workspace start, allowing you to catch configuration mistakes earlier.
* Using `gp validate --prebuild` you can create run a workspace just as a Prebuild would, which makes it easier to debug a Prebuild configuration by re-creating the exact state inside a running workspace.

The power of a [CDE](https://www.gitpod.io/cde) comes with a well-defined configuration. Because, when your workspace is configured, you can make use of ephemeral workspaces, multi-track development and other benefits of developing in the cloud.

To update a configuration, you would commit your `.gitpod.yml` and start a new workspace. This process would delay the time to finding out a configuration was incorrect, and in the mean time pollute your source control with commits like: ”*updates*”, ”*next*”, ”*please work!*”, ”*please work this time*” — yeah, we know how it feels!

Which is why we are “shifting left” and bringing errors, validation and suggestions closer to when you are actually developing on and iterating on your configuration. The new Gitpod command `gp validate` allows you to do exactly this: validate your configuration changes without committing, or leaving your workspace!

`gp validate` is included in every workspace. It works by creating a “workspace within your workspace” using Docker. The command mounts your `/workspace` directory, and pulls through all necessary information such as environment variables. By building a workspace within your existing workspace, we can heavily cache changes as Docker layers, making the update cycle to your configuration ⚡️ super, super fast ⚡️.

For more, see [configuring workspaces](/docs/configure/workspaces).

## FAQs

**Does `gp validate` apply it’s changes to the currently opened workspace?**

The `gp validate` command creates a workspace within your current workspace so you can quickly try our your configuration changes without committing or needing to do a full workspace restart. You do still need to commit and start a new workspace to apply the changes to your current (and future) workspaces. However, committing your configuration should now be more of a formality, as your configuration now be validated.

**Does `gp validate` apply to all files and configurations in the workspace?**

The `gp validate` command is compatible with `.gitpod.yml` and your workspace base image, whether a Dockerfile in the current workspace, or referencing an image hosted elsewhere. The workspace that `gp validate` creates shares the file system with the parent workspace, meaning all files and folders are copied into that workspace. This is especially useful when you install a tool, and want to execute or experiment with that tool immediately.

![Gitpod workspaces are being updated to use Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish).](/images/changelog/jammy.webp)
Gitpod Classic
## [Workspace Images OS Update and Breaking Changes](/changelog/workpace-images-os-update-and-breaking-changes)

On **April 3rd**, Gitpod will upgrade their workspace images to utilize the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of Ubuntu, which is `Ubuntu 22.04.2` (codenamed “Jammy Jellyfish”). As this is a significant release, there are some breaking changes that you should take into account. In case you encounter any problems with your workspaces as a result of this update, kindly submit an issue in the [workspace-images](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images) repository.

## What should you do

Consider [which docker image tag](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#docker-image-tags) is right for your team and repo(s).

Options to consider:

1. Continue using the `latest` tag. New workspace starts after the release will use Jammy.
2. Test Jammy before it is released using tag `2023-03-24-02-48-18`.
3. Continue using Focal even after the release using tag `2023-01-16-03-31-28`. Switch to Jammy at your leisure, after you’ve had more time to do testing.
4. Use a [custom base image](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#custom-base-image), and continue using Focal for a longer period of time.

## Breaking changes

1. All maintained images have been updated from Focal to Jammy [[1](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/#-images-well-maintain)][[2](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/#-specific-images)] at [hub.docker.com/u/gitpod](https://hub.docker.com/u/gitpod).
2. [`gitpod/workspace-ruby-2` is deprecated and will not be updated; Ruby 2.7 is EOL March 31, 2023](https://endoflife.date/ruby).
3. Upgraded `gitpod/workspace-mongodb` to mongo v6. v5 doesn’t support OpenSSL 3, [OpenSSL 3 comes out of the box with Jammy](https://packages.ubuntu.com/source/jammy/openssl).
4. Updated `gitpod/workspace-node-lts` from Node 16 to Node 18, and also in `gitpod/workspace-full`.
5. Updated `gitpod/workspace-node` from Node 18 to Node 19.
6. Installed Python 3.9 in `gitpod/workspace-yugabytedb*`, changing its `base` ref from `full`. Refer to its [dockerfile](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/blob/kylos101/jam/chunks/tool-yugabytedb/Dockerfile#L27) for background

## Fixes

1. Bumped Rust to 1.67.1
2. Bumped Ruby patch versions for 3.0, 3.1, 3.2
3. Overrode OpenSSL for Ruby 3.0 to support Jammy
4. Bump Ruby in `gitpod/workspace-full` from 3.1 to 3.2
5. Bump Python in `gitpod/workspace-full` from Python 3.8 to 3.11
6. Bump `nvm` version from 0.39.0 to 0.39.3

## New features

1. Use asdf version manager in `gitpod/workspace-elixir` to more easily manage erlang and elixir versions

## FAQs

**Is Gitpod still maintaining support for Focal in its images?**

No. Please consider the [above options](#what-should-you-do) to handle the update.

**What else should I consider as part of the upgrade?**

The GNU C Library (glibc) varies between [Focal](https://packages.ubuntu.com/source/focal/glibc) and [Jammy](https://packages.ubuntu.com/source/jammy/glibc).

OpenSSL varies between [Focal](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/focal/%2Bsource/openssl) and [Jammy](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/jammy/%2Bsource/openssl).

Both led to some of the breaking changes (above). Therefore, this may impact you and your team, depending on your related workloads.

[March 28, 2023](/changelog/organizational-policy-workspace-sharing)
![Setting for enabling or disabling workspace sharing for an Organization.](/images/changelog/organizational-policy-workspace-sharing.jpg)
Gitpod ClassicGitpod Enterprise
## [Organizational Policy For Workspace Sharing 🔒](/changelog/organizational-policy-workspace-sharing)

To give you more control over who has access to your development environments with Gitpod, Organization Owners can now [restrict workspace sharing](/docs/configure/orgs/policies#workspace-sharing) for workspaces created within their Organization using an [Organizational Policy](/docs/configure/orgs/policies). Disabling workspace sharing prevents any user running a workspace in that organization from sharing their workspace with others.

To disable workspace sharing in your organization, go to [settings](https://gitpod.io/settings/policy).

For more information see:

* [Organizational Policies](/docs/configure/orgs/policies)
* [Workspace Sharing Policy](/docs/configure/orgs/policies#workspace-sharing)
* [Workspace Collaboration](/docs/configure/workspaces/collaboration)

## FAQs

**What happens to previously shared workspaces?**

Workspaces can stop sharing at any time, regardless of policy set. Access for workspaces shared before the policy is set will remain until workspace sharing is stopped for that specific workspace.

**Does this always prevent the repository from being shared in a workspace?**

Restricting workspace sharing only applies to workspaces that belong to the Organization that has the policy applied. Workspaces created in other organizations inherit policies related to that Organization.

Gitpod ClassicGitpod Enterprise
## [Introducing Flexible Timeouts 🥳 !](/changelog/flexible-workspace-timeouts)

You can now set your workspace timeout up to 24 hours using the command line, direct in your favorite editor or IDE or configure a global default! Setting a configurable timeout is useful if you’re working on a long running task, need to leave your workspace open for a while and then revisit it, or whilst collaborating or sharing previews with others.

To try out this feature, type: `gp timeout set 1h` to set the timeout for the currently running workspace to 1 hour. Or, go to your [user preferences](https://gitpod.io/user/preferences) to set the default value for all future timeouts.

## FAQs

**Does this work for free users?**

Only users on paid plan can set custom timeouts.

**Can timeout defaults be restricted by an organisation owner or administrator?**

Not currently.

Prebuild Workspace Class • [Learn More](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-classes)

Prebuilds do a lot of work downloading dependencies, building projects, and getting everything ready so you are *Always ready to code*. Prebuilds often need more resources and power than the average workspace. Now you can configure different workspace classes for your project prebuilds. Check out your project settings for more details.

## Workspace Images OS and Node versions update

~~On February 28th,~~ Gitpod workspace images will be upgraded to use Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish). Additionally, `gitpod/workspace-node` and `gitpod/workspace-node-lts` workspace images will be upgraded to use Node 19.0.0 and Node 18.13.0, respectively.

If you’d like to continue using the current OS and Node versions, you may pin the workspace image version by changing the tag from `latest` to `2023-01-16-03-31-28` (e.g. `gitpod/workspace-node-lts:2023-01-16-03-31-28`) in your `.gitpod.yml` or `Dockerfile`.

## Start new workspace with more options

Now you can start a new workspace with more options. You can choose the IDE, the workspace class, and any [context url](/docs/introduction/gitpod-tutorial/1-start-your-workspace#open-your-repository). 🎉

Gitpod Classic
## [November Gitpod Release 2022](/changelog/november-gitpod-release-2022)

Welcome to the November 2022 edition of the Gitpod Changelog!

**Key highlights**

* [Prebuilds require a project](#prebuilds-require-a-project)
* [CLion and Rider are now out in beta! 🎉](#clion-and-rider-are-now-out-in-beta)
* [Configure JetBrains IDE Settings across workspaces](#configure-jetbrains-ide-settings-across-workspaces)

* [Reduced IDE startup time & Custom Shells [Breaking Change]](#reduced-ide-startup-time--custom-shells-breaking-change)

## Prebuilds require a project

In the past, it was possible to trigger [prebuilds](/docs/configure/repositories/prebuilds) by prefixing the repository URL with `gitpod.io/#prebuild/`. This mechanism has been turned off, because projects provide much better visibility into your prebuilds.

Use the following steps to enable prebuilds on your repository:

1. [Create a repository](/docs/configure/repositories#adding-a-repository) for the repository.
2. Define the prebuild steps in an `init` [task](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks) in your [gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml).

Since prebuilds are included in all our metered [pay-as-you-go](/docs/configure/billing) plans, configuring prebuild settings in your project should help with managing prebuild usage.

## CLion and Rider are now out in beta! 🎉

1. First we announced [IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, GoLand, and PhpStorm](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpod-jetbrains)
2. Then it was the turn of [RubyMine and WebStorm](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/webstorm-rubymine-now-in-beta)

Today—as part of our [official partnership with JetBrains](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpod-jetbrains)—we “complete the set” of JetBrains IDEs that integrate with Gitpod via [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway). Gitpod now has first-class IDE integration support for both Rider and CLion! 🤘

**Getting started with CLion or Rider:**

1. **Install [JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/remote-development-a.html#gateway)** - With the [JetBrains Gateway and Gitpod](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway) plugin you can create and manage your latest 20 Gitpod workspaces.
2. **Install the Gitpod plugin** - Open JetBrains Gateway and you’ll see the Gitpod logo on the main page. Click “install” to install the [Gitpod plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway) for JetBrains Gateway.
3. **Update your Gitpod preferences** - Select CLion or Rider on the [Gitpod preferences page](https://gitpod.io/preferences) which will set the IDE as your default for future workspace starts.
4. **Start (or restart) your workspace** - Either start a workspace directly from within [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway) via the Gitpod plugin **OR** open a new workspace directly in Gitpod where on workspace start you will be prompted to open CLion or Rider for that workspace.

## Configure JetBrains IDE Settings across workspaces

You can now configure your IDE settings at the project and user level. At the [Project](/docs/configure/repositories) level, you can use your [Workspace Image](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image) or commit settings to Git. At the user level, you can now configure settings by leveraging [Dotfiles](/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles).

A common question we get from Gitpod users is ”*how can I configure JetBrains IDE settings so that they’re saved across workspaces*”. Without some way to sync IDE settings, you are missing out on fully embracing the power of Gitpod, ephemeral workspaces and [cloud development environments](https://www.gitpod.io/cde).

For an example, see [IntelliJ IDEA](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/intellij) for how to configure IDE settings.

See your favorite JetBrains [IDE page](/docs/references/ides-and-editors) for more.

## Reliable VS Code extensions: Gitpod now hosting an Open VSX Mirror!

Gitpod [uses the Open VSX registry](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode-extensions#why-do-we-need-open-vsx) both for VS Code Extensions when using the [VS Code in the browser](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode-browser) integration, and when combined with Gitpod [VS Code Settings Sync](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/settings-sync). In the unfortunate case that the main Open VSX registry was unavailable or unresponsive, regrettably Gitpod users could be exposed to downtime and see extensions failing to load in Gitpod workspaces. Whilst Gitpod has caching in place for Open VSX extensions, some extensions could still fail to fetch, causing disruption. To mitigate the issue, Gitpod is now running a full mirror of Open VSX, fully operated by Gitpod, allowing us to drastically improve the availability of Open VSX delivered extensions. 🎉

Nothing should prevent you from being “Ready To Code” with Gitpod.

## Manage workspace ports without needing to leave your JetBrains UI

You can now view ports both in your JetBrains terminal, and in the JetBrains backend control center.

1. **From the backend control center** - In addition to [performing many Gitpod actions from the JetBrains backend performance center](https://gitpod.io/changelog/september-gitpod-release-2022#jetbrains-backend-control-center---gitpod-workspace-actions) you can now also view and manage your ports. See which ports are being forwarded or exposed. You can also add, remove and open URLs for your workspace ports without leaving the JetBrains UI.

![JetBrains Ports view in Gitpod workspace](/images/jetbrains-gateway/jetbrains-ports-view.png)

1. **From within the terminals view** - You can now also see, and manage your ports from the terminal view direct in the JetBrains IDE, allowing you to manage any ports related to the current running terminal process all without leaving the terminal window in your IDE.

![JetBrains Ports view in Terminal in Gitpod workspace](/images/jetbrains-gateway/port-actions-jetbrains-terminal.png)

Running your IDE on your desktop means that all your ports are automatically forwarded, so you can use your `localhost` URL as usual. You can also manage ports from any IDE or Gitpod interface using the [Gitpod CLI](/docs/references/gitpod-cli). For example, try running `gp ports list` in any workspace to see a list of your workspaces running ports.

## Reduced IDE startup time & Custom Shells [Breaking Change]

If you don’t use custom shells such as `zsh` or `fish`, you just need to know that we made some changes to speed up the IDE startup time! 🎉

If you use a custom shell, and you rely on bash profile to configure your workspace, continue reading..

In an effort to speed-up the IDE startup time, we made some changes to how we launch IDEs inside workspaces. Previously, we would automatically source interactive login bash shell’s profile, but it was a side-effect of our method of launching the IDE. We now changed this behaviur and Gitpod uses the shell configured by the user via the `SHELL` env var. If you use a custom shell but you’re relying on configurations specified in bash profile, you might need to update your configuration, check out [Configure a custom shell](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#configure-a-custom-shell) for examples.

If you have feedback about using custom shells within Gitpod, we’d love t hear it, leave your thoughts in [#10105](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/10105).

## Even more power! ⚡ Try large workspaces with pay-as-you-go 🎉

> **Important:** Prices and terms are subject to change.

With [pay-as-you-go](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/billing/pay-as-you-go) you get early access to [workspace classes](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-classes), allowing you to customize your workspace resources. To get access to [pay-as-you-go](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/billing/pay-as-you-go) either for teams or individual users, please [contact us](https://www.gitpod.io/contact/support).

**How does pay-as-you-go work?**

* Gitpod usage is measured in credits, based on how long your workspaces run, and the resources consumed by different workspace classes. Metered usage also includes [prebuilds](/docs/configure/repositories/prebuilds).
* [Individual users](/docs/configure/billing/pay-as-you-go#configure-personal-billing) receive 500 free credits per month on the free plan, these credits are equivalent to 50 Standard workspace hours or 25 Large workspace hours.
* For users who upgrade to the personal paid plan at €/$ 9.00 per month, workspace usage allowance increases to 1000 credits.
* The standard pay-as-you-go rate for paid users, and [for teams](/docs/configure/billing/pay-as-you-go#configure-team-billing), is €/$ 0.036 per credit.
* Existing paid plans need to be cancelled for pay-as-you-go billing to work.

[I want early access!](/contact/support)
## Start workspaces based on existing prebuilds ⚡️

![Prebuild Detail page - Start new (workspace with this prebuild) button](/images/changelog/2022-10-31/start-new-workspace-with-this-prebuild.jpg)
*Start a new workspace based on an existing prebuild*

You can now start workspaces using existing prebuilds. This helps when you have a repo with many commits, so you’re not left waiting for the latest prebuild to finish. To get started, select a prebuild from your project prebuild list, and click ”**New Workspace (with this prebuild)**”

## JetBrains RubyMine and WebStorm IDEs now in beta 🚀

![JetBrains RubyMine and WebStorm logos connected to a Gitpod logo](/images/blog/webstorm-rubymine-now-in-beta/webstorm-rubymine-announcement-gitpod.webp)

We are continuing to expand support for JetBrains IDEs as part of our [official partnership](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpod-jetbrains) with [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/).

See the [RubyMine & WebStorm announcement](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/webstorm-rubymine-now-in-beta) for more.

## New “exposed ports” view in VS Code Desktop 🔌

![A panel in VS Code Desktop listing open ports in the workspace](/images/editors/vscode-exposed-ports.png)

To give you all the power of Gitpod, we’ve added a new tab, `EXPOSED PORTS`, which gives you additional functionality in addition to the regular ports view of *Remote - SSH*, like port visibility (public/private).

> Due to constraints with [Remote - SSH extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh), we cannot extend the default VS Code ports view.

## Ports sorting now based on your gitpod.yml definition ⏬

Ports shown in all Gitpod clients are now ordered based on:

1. The order of the ports definition in the `.gitpod.yml`
2. All other ports are numerically sorted in ascending order.

This change applies to all of VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, SSH and the Gitpod CLI.

Example output of `gp ports list`:

![language icon](/svg/docs/language.svg)
![language icon](/svg/docs/language-dark.svg)
bash

```
| PORT  | STATUS         | URL                            | NAME & DESCRIPTION |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| 3000  | open (public)  | https://3000-repo...gitpod.io  | Web Server Preview |
| 5900  | open (private) | https://5900-repo...gitpod.io  | Postgres Database  |
| 5555  | open (private) | https://5555-repo...gitpod.io  |                    |
| 36341 | open (private) | https://36341-repo...gitpod.io |                    |
```

See [ports](/docs/configure/workspaces/ports) documentation for more.

## Easily find information about your workspace with `gp info` ℹ️

You can now display information about the current [workspace](/docs/configure/workspaces) (such as the workspace ID and URL) and also the [workspace class](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-classes), using the new command from [Gitpod CLI](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) called `gp info`.

**Example output:**

![language icon](/svg/docs/language.svg)
![language icon](/svg/docs/language-dark.svg)
bash

Copy code
Copy copied
```
  Workspace ID    : gitpodio-gitpod-4q1200dvfcf
  Instance ID     : 8a6188a3-4c7f-49fe-aa4d-db968c11e183
  Workspace class : Large: Up to 8 vCPU, 16GB memory, 50GB disk
  Workspace URL   : https://gitpodio-gitpod-4q1200dvfcf.ws-eu67.gitpod.io
  Cluster host    : ws-eu67.gitpod.io
```

See the [Gitpod CLI](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#info) reference page for more.

> [Default environment variables](/docs/configure/workspaces/environment-variables#default-environment-variables) will soon be deprecated, please update all scripts to use `gp info --json`.

## VS Code ports view is now responsive ⏩

*New ports view on left navigation, with responsive design*

The ports view in VS Code is now responsive depending on the ports view width. The view defaults to the bottom VS Code navigation bar, however, the ports view can be drag-and-dropped to the sidebar if you prefer. You can access all port actions as normal on all views. In larger views, more information about your ports is shown.

For feedback let us know on the [ports experience GitHub issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/9262).

## Projects now only created under teams, not personal accounts ⚠️

* You can no longer create Gitpod Projects under personal accounts.
* All projects must now be created as part of a team.
* Existing personal projects will continue to work.

## Using private workspace images is now in alpha

Did you know that you can [use a private Docker image](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#use-a-private-docker-image) with Gitpod? Private Docker image support for workspace images has been possible for some time, however it was an undocumented feature. We’ve now updated our documentation so that you can more easily give try out the feature. As the feature is currently alpha, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/new/choose) for any feedback.

### Security

This release includes security fixes addressing information leakage in logs; see the [security announcement log](https://www.gitpod.io/security/log) for more information.

### 2022.09.2 hotfix (published on 21.7.2022)

This hotfix includes:

* [#13934](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/13934) Fix for an issue where secrets could end up in logs because the installer was logging the env var object. For more information, see the [security announcement log](../security/log#update-21102022)
* [#13959](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/13959) This fix adds a checkbox to enable the HTTP proxy settings. Proxy settings were sometimes being incorrectly applied before this. Now, the values are still taken from the KOTS CLI input variables, but will not be applied until the option is configured in the UI.

### 2022.09.1 hotfix (published on 14.7.2022)

[#13821](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/13821) This hotfix includes a change to fix the regression caused by `protected_secrets` (see [security announcement log](../security/log) for more information) when working with self-signed certs.

### Highlights

#### Preflight checks on the Gitpod configuration

[#12015](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/12015) We know that some of you are using config patches to configure additional aspects of Gitpod, such as the resources that workspaces use. Up until now, there was no validation on these patches and thus it was difficult to debug if there was an issue with them. This has changed now - there is a preflight check that validates these (and the Gitpod configuration as a whole), and then informs you where to look to find any errors.

#### Additional safeguards during updates

[#13215](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/13215) During updates, we recommend that you do not have any workspaces running to prevent data loss (see update guide). There is now a preflight check that checks for running workspaces before you deploy and fails if it finds any running ones. If an update is deployed anyways, running workspaces will be stopped for you. Note that users will see their workspaces stopped arbitrarily.

### Breaking changes

* Single Cluster Reference Architecture changes:
  + Regular workspaces and headless workspaces are isolated to separate node pools to help avoid noisy neighbor issues between the two and guarantee maximum performance for workspaces
  + Workspace Services (such as `ws-manager`) are deployed to the services nodepool to prevent potential service degradation from high `ws-daemon` memory use.
  + We’ve increased the default node size to 16 core / 64 GB nodes. This is to allow for more workspaces per node, and avoid the scenario where there is just one workspace per node. We’ve also added documentation to detail our recommendations around workspace resources.

### Fixes and improvements

[#12196](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/12196) The KOTS installer script is used to generate a config file out of the values inserted into the KOTS UI. We’ve refactored large parts of it to turn it from a bash script into a part of the installer image. This improves reliability and predictability for you and maintainability for us. It also allows us to call this during preflight checks, enabling us to provide the preflight checks for config patches mentioned above.

### JetBrains Backend Control Center - Gitpod workspace actions

![The Backend Control Center in JetBrains showing various Gitpod workspace actions](/images/jetbrains-gateway/workspace-actions.png)
*Caption: The Backend Control Center in JetBrains showing various Gitpod workspace actions*

If you’re a Gitpod VS Code user, you know that in the command palette you can do things like:

1. Stop your workspace
2. Open the Gitpod dashboard
3. Open in VS Code Desktop

…and much more.

However, for JetBrains users, there was no way to access these common Gitpod commands without leaving the workspace. Or worse, opening your workspace using VS Code, rather than your preferred JetBrains IDE. It’s important that all the Gitpod editors and IDEs have a first-class experience for our users, no matter their preference, and our Jetbrains IDEs are no exception.

But now, we’ve added all of the Gitpod workspace actions you could do in VS Code into JetBrains.

You can now access these commands through:

* The Backend Control Center in JetBrains
* Or via the JetBrains IDE search menu

That means from within a JetBrains IDE you can directly:

1. [Open the Gitpod Dashboard](https://gitpod.io/)
2. [Open your workspace context](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/introduction/gitpod-tutorial/1-start-your-workspace#open-your-repository)
3. [Open your user settings](https://gitpod.io/user/account)
4. [Manage workspace access control](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/integrations)
5. [Go to the Gitpod documentation](https://gitpod.io/docs)
6. [Report an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/new/choose)
7. [Follow Gitpod on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gitpod)
8. [Access our community server on Discord](https://www.gitpod.io/chat)
9. [Upgrade your Gitpod subscription](https://www.gitpod.io/pricing)
10. [Stop your workspace](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-lifecycle#timeouts)
11. [Extend your workspace timeout](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-lifecycle#timeouts)
12. [Share your a snapshot of your workspace](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/collaboration#sharing-snapshots)

All from the comfort of your IDE.

### JetBrains Backend Control Center - Workspace Classes

![The Backend Control Center in JetBrains showing workspace class information (e.g. 6 vCPU, 12GB memory)](/images/jetbrains-gateway/jetbrains-backend-control-center.png)
*Caption: The Backend Control Center in JetBrains showing workspace class information (e.g. 6 vCPU, 12GB memory)*

Did you know that when you’re working with JetBrains IDEs in Gitpod you can [monitor the performance of your workspace in real-time](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/intellij#workspace-performance) via the JetBrains Backend Control Center? This feature is useful when your workspace isn’t performing as you’d expect and you want to gather more information. In addition to our recent additions of `Workspace CPU` and `Workspace Memory` we’ve now added the actual workspace class to the information shown in the control center.

… but why? When you work in a cloud developer environment, you should have the flexibility to choose the right performance profile for your project. Recently we’ve been working to bring to Gitpod a feature we call “Workspaces Classes” [#8261](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/8261). With Workspaces Classes you’ll be able to select workspace specifications that better match your use case. For example, you will be able to get more powerful workspaces to run larger Java projects and IntelliJ.

So since we needed somewhere to show you this Workspace Class information, you can now find it in the JetBrains performance center.

> **Tip:** You can run [`gp top`](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/command-line-interface#top) to see performance info no matter the IDE or editor you’re using.

### JetBrains Reconnect With Open Windows

![JetBrains Reconnect](/images/jetbrains-gateway/intellij-workspace-already-open.png)

Previously, with JetBrains if you tried to open your workspace twice, the Gitpod JetBrains Gateway plugin would allow you, sometimes leading to odd behaviors or bugs, since JetBrains Gateway is designed to only allow one window to open. Now, when you try to open an already opened window with JetBrains Gateway, you’ll get a prompt to remind you that the workspace is already opened.

### New Ports View in VS Code

![The new VS Code Browser ports view, shown at the bottom of VS Code alongside the terminals and output tabs](/images/changelog/2022-08-01/ports.png)
*Caption: The new VS Code Browser ports view, shown at the bottom of VS Code alongside the terminals and output tabs*

You might have seen in our last changelog that [we mentioned a new ports view](https://www.gitpod.io/changelog/new-ports-explorer-changelog-view-and-connection-improvements-for-vs-code#new-ports-explorer-in-vs-code-browser) being added to VS Code (in the browser). At that time we were rolling out the feature to only subsets of our Gitpod users to see how users responded. However, after some good feedback from you (our users) we have pushed the feature out to all users! 🥳

We introduced the new ports view as we wanted to align our experiences on VS Code Desktop with VS Code Browser. We know lots of users like to use Gitpod in the browser sometimes for “smaller changes” like reviewing pull requests. But for more “deep work” many users opt for VS Code Desktop. However and wherever you choose to code, Gitpod will make that as much a comfortable and familiar experience as you’re used to.

### SSH Gateway default for Self-Hosted VS Code Desktop Users

We have previously shared about how we [updated the underlying connection method of VS Code Desktop](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/vscode-desktop-ssh-updates) to Gitpod for our [new SSH Gateway approach](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode#connecting-to-vs-code-desktop-ssh). The feature was first released defaulted off for all users. We have since enabled this SSH access method for all users of [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io/), and now we’ve enabled the approach for all VS Code Desktop users of Gitpod everywhere, no matter which installation they’re using.

### Configurable core dump behavior

Debugging applications in Gitpod that are written with C++, Rust, or Python just got easier.

We’ve added a new `coreDump` configuration property to the `.gitpod.yml` file, allowing you to configure your workspace core dump behavior. You can enable/disable core dumps, or set soft and hard limits for them. For information on how to configure this property, check out the [core dump property](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/gitpod-yml#coredump) of the `.gitpod.yml`

### Faster startup times for large repositories

Are you working with a large git repository? You want to hear about this.

We have changed how files are fetched from git into Gitpod on workspace start, to make your experience faster. In our testing of the changes, we observed differences from around 2m30s down to 40s. If you’re using large repositories with Gitpod, give it a try and [let us know](https://gitpod.io/support) about your experience 🚀

## Improvements for JetBrains IDEs

We are continuing to make progress with the JetBrains and Gitpod integration #[7956](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/7956) as part of our ongoing [partnership with JetBrains](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpod-jetbrains). Whilst most of our efforts are mostly towards IntelliJ IDEA, a lot of the improvements we are making will still apply to our other [supported JetBrains IDEs](/docs/references/ides-and-editors).

### JetBrains now supports multiple task Terminals

A key part of “Gitpodifying” a project is adding any necessary tasks, such as starting servers or database to your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml). One advantage of declaring these processes in your `.gitpod.yml` configuration is that your commands are picked up by the IDE or editor and show on workspace start.

Previously, JetBrains with Gitpod only showed a single terminal, meaning that users needed to use `gp tasks` to interact with running terminals. Due to some improvements for JetBrains Remote Development that we are able to leverage, you can now see all of your terminals inside the IDE as you also can with VS Code.

### JetBrains now respects configured Java SDK (JDK) versions

Previously, when opening a Java Workspace with JetBrains, the Gitpod IDE would select the latest Java SDK (JDK) version as the default.

This was problematic when we recently updated the Gitpod `workspace-full` image, to include both Java 11 and 17, which many users rely upon. When having multiple JDK versions, JetBrains would default to using the latest JDK version, which in the case of the `workspace-full` image was 17, and not 11, causing a minor regression. Now, Gitpod respects configured JDK versions in locations such as the `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME`.

![jetbrains gateway java sdk](/images/jetbrains-gateway/java-sdk-configuration.png)
*JetBrains IDEs now picking up the correct SDK version by default*

### View Resource Consumption in JetBrains Backend Control Center

When using a Gitpod workspace you might experience performance issues caused by an application using more resources than expected, or due to resource consumption in adjacent containers on the node. Whatever the reason, you may want to investigate what’s going on within your workspace.

We’ve now extended the JetBrains [Backend Control Center](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-inside-remote-project.html#control_center) with two additional bits of information about your workspace: `Workspace CPU` and `Workspace Memory`. The additional performance information shown in the control center is for the node that your workspace is running on, and not the workspace itself. This information is also the same that can be found from running the command `gp top` in your workspace.

![jetbrains gateway performance center](/images/jetbrains-gateway/jetbrains-performance-center.png)

## Improvements for VS Code Desktop

We have been continuing to invest in our desktop editor experiences, including VS Code #[7184](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/7184), with an emphasis on removing any barriers or friction in getting the VS Code editor open with a Gitpod workspace, establishing a stable connection via SSH, and improving the experience of restarting a timed out workspace.

### Sync Local VS Code extensions

The underlying Microsoft [VS Code - Remote SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) extension that powers the Gitpod [VS Code Desktop integration](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode) does not automatically install local user extensions on remote machines, such as a Gitpod workspace. For users, because VS Code - Remote SSH does not automatically install local extensions, that means you’ll have to manually click “install” for each local extensions on every Gitpod workspace start. Installing extensions manually is cumbersome, especially when you have many extensions to install and is a barrier to utilising Gitpod ephemeral workspaces.

In an upcoming release, Gitpod will prompt you to enable [VS Code Setting Sync](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/settings-sync#enabling-settings-sync-in-vs-code-desktop) with Gitpod, which will allow Gitpod to retrieve local extensions and automatically install them in your workspace. If for any reason you want to disable syncing of local extensions, you can do so via the `gitpod.remote.syncExtension` VS Code settings. If you have any feedback or thoughts, please add it to the GitHub issue: [#7906](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/7906).

![Install local VS Code extensions notification](/images/changelog/2022-08-31/local-extensions.png)
*Prompt to enable Setting Sync with Gitpod to sync local VS Code extensions*

### VS Code Desktop reduced popups when opening

Many users love Gitpod for how simple it can make working with your projects. However, for VS Code Desktop there were some cases where you needed to respond to specific popups when opening your workspace, for instance accepting the SSH fingerprint of the workspace, or accepting the browser redirect when opening a workspace.

The number of prompts you are now shown when opening VS Code Desktop is reduced.

You should see one browser redirect prompt (one for [VS Code Desktop](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode) and one for [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway)), marking “always allow” will suppress all future prompts. SSH fingerprints are also now automatically added to your `known_hosts` if you’re using [SSH Gateway approach to opening VS Code Desktop](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode#connecting-to-vs-code-desktop-ssh).

![Accepting the SSH fingerprint in VS Code](/images/editors/vscode-ssh-fingerprint-light-theme.png)
![Accepting the SSH fingerprint in VS Code](/images/editors/vscode-ssh-fingerprint-dark-theme.png)
*Using the SSH Gateway approach for VS Code Desktop means no more SSH fingerprint prompts*

For more information, check out our dedicated documentation for [optimising VS Code Desktop](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode#optimizing-vs-code-desktop).

### All VS Code Desktop users on SaaS are now using SSH Gateway! 🎉

We have now completed a migration of all VS Code Desktop users on SaaS to our new SSH Gateway approach. This change brings improved stability, smoother restarting of workspaces, and more.

To get setup, we recommend you [upload an SSH key to Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/ssh#upload-an-ssh-key-to-gitpod). For full details on why we made this change to our SSH approach for VS Code Desktop, please check out our blog post [VS Code Desktop and SSH explained](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/vscode-desktop-ssh-updates).

If you cannot use the new approach for any reason, please reach out via the GitHub issue #[7452](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/7452).

![new ssh key](/images/docs/new-ssh-key-light-theme.png)

## Improvements for the Gitpod CLI (`gp`)

Over the last few months we’ve been making lots of updates to the [Gitpod CLI](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) (`gp`). Because the `gp` command-line-interface is bundled inside of all Gitpod workspaces, `gp` acts as a common way to run workspace actions regardless of what editor or IDE you’re using Gitpod with, whether that’s JetBrains, VS Code or directly via SSH.

Let’s say that you’re documenting your Gitpod setup, rather than detailing actions directly how to take some action in each of the [Gitpod supported IDEs & editors](/docs/references/ides-and-editors), you can share `gp` commands knowing that the experience will be consistent across all workspace editing experiences.

### `gp tasks list` shows your current tasks (as defined in the .gitpod.yml)

The `gp tasks list` command allows you to list any running commands that are defined in your `.gitpod.yml`. If you want, you can even attach to a given task using `gp tasks attach` which brings that current task into the foreground of your terminal. However, since there are situations where it might not be as easy to figure out which terminal you’re currently viewing, that’s why we now highlight your current task to make life a little easier for you

![gp task list](/images/editors/gp-task-list-highlight.png)

### `gp tasks stop` stops running tasks that (as defined in the .gitpod.yml)

You can now run `gp tasks stop` to stop running tasks that have been defined in your `.gitpod.yml`. You can either stop a single task with `gp tasks stop <id>`, or terminate all tasks by running `gp tasks stop --all`.

See the `gp` [Command Line Interface](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#stop-1) documentation for more.

## Improvements for SSH connections to Gitpod

The SSH protocol is the primary method of connection to Gitpod workspaces for JetBrains IDEs, VS Code Desktop and users who directly SSH into Gitpod for editing, or working with their code. We’ve been working to ensure that Gitpod has a wide range of support for different SSH clients and SSH key versions.

### Improved OpenSSH compatibility and support for sha256/sha512

Previously, Gitpod did not support OpenSSH clients >v8.8, nor did Gitpod support RSA sha256/sha512. For users using VS Code Desktop with the SSH Gateway approach, this could mean that in some cases users could not leverage SSH access to Gitpod due to incompatible keys or OpenSSH client’s, however this issue should now be resolved.

### Feature highlights

#### Automatic backups

We’ve added the ability to back up your Gitpod application config (no workspace or database data is backed up!) via the KOTS Installation UI under the “snapshots” tab. You can even configure automatically scheduled backups. You can learn more in our backup and restore guide.

#### Configure additional registry credentials to use (base) workspace images from private registries

You can now use workspace images that are stored in private registries different from the main registry configured for Gitpod in your gitpod.yml and as an installation-wide default. This is useful when, for example, you want to pull private base images from one registry and then store the built images in another. For more information visit the relevant guide.

### Breaking changes

* [11954](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/11954): remove custom labels from the pod selector labels. This removes this limitation so this is a long-term improvement. The impact of this should be handled transparently for you by the KOTS installer.
* [12336](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/12336): Removal of PodSecurityPolicies. These were deprecated from Kubernetes 1.21 and removed from 1.25. This allows Gitpod to run on Kubernetes 1.25+, which is scheduled for imminent release. If you have PodSecurityPolicies enabled in your cluster, we suggest you disable them as soon as possible.

Please refer to the 2022.08 upgrade guide in the documentation for details.

## [New ports explorer, changelog view, and connection improvements for VS Code](/changelog/new-ports-explorer-changelog-view-and-connection-improvements-for-vs-code)

Users of the latest release could notice that we were working on improvements to VS Code Browser and Desktop.
Now they are available in stable release as well via VS Code settings. Key highlights are:

* **[Connection improvements for VS Code Desktop](#connection-improvements-for-vs-code-desktop)** to bring stability and performance.
* **[New ports explorer in VS Code Browser](#new-ports-explorer-in-vs-code-browser)** to align interface with VS Code Desktop.
* **[Latest changelog view in VS Code](#latest-changelog-view-in-vs-code)** to access the latest changelog directly from VS Code Browser or Desktop.

> You can enable `Latest Release` in [your preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences) and try the latest updates as soon as they are available.

### Connection improvements for VS Code Desktop

We developed a new SSH connection mode for VS Code Desktop which brings stability and performance improvements.
This mode can be enabled by setting `gitpod.remote.useLocalApp` to `false` in VS Code settings and will be enabled by default in future releases.

You can learn more about new the approach in its announcement [blog post](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/vscode-desktop-ssh-updates). If you’re short of time:

1. Connection has improved stability, with fewer disconnections
2. Approach doesn’t overwrite the [`remote.SSH.configFile`](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/10/03/remote-ssh-tips-and-tricks#_ssh-configuration-file)
3. No additional binary downloads required or background processes
4. Fewer requests from VS Code to accept the SSH fingerprint
5. Improved operating system support via OpenSSH

### New ports explorer in VS Code Browser

We developed a new ports explorer in VS Code Browser to align the interface with VS Code Desktop.
You can enable, or disable it via the `gitpod.experimental.portsView.enabled` in VS Code settings.
Give the feature a try and we’d love to hear [your feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/7408).

### Latest changelog view in VS Code

The new VS Code command `Gitpod: Show Release Notes` let you access latest changelog directly from VS Code Browser or Desktop.

### Feature highlights

Here are the highlights of what is included in this new version of Gitpod Self-Hosted:

* [Auto-cancel pending or running prebuilds on the same branch when new commits are pushed](../changelog/bring-your-own-workspace-ssh-keys)
* [Upload your public SSH keys to access your workspace](../changelog/auto-cancel-prebuilds-on-outdated-commits)

Further, a lot has been improved on the documentation side of Gitpod Self-Hosted, specifically around operating Gitpod:

* How to backup and restore Gitpod
* Business continuity and disaster recovery considerations with Gitpod
* We’ve also restructured the Self-Hosted section in our documentation to have a clearer separation of concerns around the intent of the documentation.

### Breaking changes

There are minor breaking changes regarding how you configure workspace resource limits and workspace image defaults. Please refer to the 2022.07 upgrade guide in the documentation for details.

### Fixes and improvements

* You can now configure the service type of the proxy service in the installation UI - you do not need to upload a `.yaml` file as a config patch anymore to configure this. However, having it in the config patch will still work until December.
* We’ve improved the time to deploy an update by removing the need to restart the message queue every time we deploy. This has the side benefit of reducing the risk of running workspaces misbehaving during an update. For more information, see the related [issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/11096).

## [Bring your own workspace SSH keys](/changelog/bring-your-own-workspace-ssh-keys)

SSH (secure shell) is a critical protocol for remote development.
Both [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/remote-development-a.html) IDEs and the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) editor use SSH as their remote development foundation. So, a big focus at Gitpod has been on improving performance and usability for connecting using SSH.

Which is why today **we’re excited to announce that in Gitpod you can now upload your own public keys to access your workspace.** In addition, we’ve also removed the requirement for a mandatory public key to be available when access Gitpod using SSH with an Access Token.
With SSH public key upload you can now:

1. Re-connect to workspaces without needing to go back to the Gitpod dashboard.
2. Benefit from improved security when accessing your workspace with a private key.

See [the announcement post](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/ssh-key-upload) for details on the use-cases, benefits and how to get started using your own key pair with Gitpod today.

Gitpod Classic
## [Auto-cancel prebuilds on outdated commits](/changelog/auto-cancel-prebuilds-on-outdated-commits)

During development, sometimes a number of commits occur within a short period of time, which can trigger and queue multiple [prebuilds](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/repositories/prebuilds) for the same branch.

Gitpod will now auto-cancel pending or running prebuilds on the same branch when new commits are pushed, efficiently processing the queue and making sure workspaces always use prebuilds with the latest commits.

Auto-cancellation has been enabled by default for all [projects](https://www.gitpod.io/changelog/introducing-teams-and-projects), but you can disable this behavior in project settings.

## [June Self-Hosted Release](/changelog/june-self-hosted-release)

We’ve released a new version of Self-Hosted Gitpod. Update instructions can be found in our update guide. You can read more about how to install it from scratch in our documentation. More details on this release can be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/releases).

> If you are on a paid Self-Hosted plan, this release will be promoted to your release channel in one week.

For feedback, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.yml) or [chat with us](https://www.gitpod.io/chat).

### New way to try out Gitpod: Local Preview (alpha)

You can now try out Gitpod Self-Hosted without having to spin up a Kubernetes cluster - via a simple `docker run` command. This will spin up Gitpod locally on your machine and enable you to experience what developing on Gitpod is like. Note that currently, only Linux-based systems are supported (Windows and Mac(Intel) are being worked on) and that unfortunately prebuilds will not work. You can read up on how to get going in the Local Preview Guide. Local preview is still in [alpha](../docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle), so we would appreciate any feedback you may have!

### More flexibility regarding registries for airgapped environments

If you are using Gitpod in an airgapped environment you can now specify the container registry you want to use to store workspace images that Gitpod builds for you. By default, it will use an in-cluster registry. Previously, it would always use the same registry that is used during installation to download the images related to Gitpod.

### Fixes and improvements

* We have added a `customer_id` field to the telemetry that is sent from a self-hosted instance. This helps us map an installation to a customer for support purposes. Note that this field is *not* being populated for users using the community plan and is *only* relevant to those on a professional plan.

A full list of changes can be found in [the release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/releases).

## [Grouping of inactive workspaces](/changelog/grouping-of-inactive-workspaces)

Did you notice any changes in your workspaces list? Inactive workspaces are now grouped below the active workspaces and also allow users to clean up (mass delete) all inactive workspaces, [see relevant pull request](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/10450)

Feedback is welcome, feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.yml) or [chat with us](https://www.gitpod.io/chat).

## [Gitpod dashboard improvements](/changelog/gitpod-dashboard-improvements)

We have made some design changes to the navbar at the top of the [Gitpod dashboard](https://gitpod.io/workspaces). It now includes an always-visible link to your workspaces on the right, and offers better color accessibility.

The team/personal selector at the top left takes you directly to your own projects, or to the projects for the selected team. If you would prefer the team/personal selection to be preserved when you visit the workspaces list, please upvote Gitpod [issue #10496](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/10496).

Always ready to code 🚀

Users are more likely to provide feedback, the easier we make it for them.

Inspired by the feedback form for Gitpod [docs pages](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure), we’ve added a similar Feedback feature in the Gitpod dashboard.

One click is enough to tell us how you feel, or write a quick note, all without leaving the page.

Gitpod Classic
## [VS Code Desktop Settings Sync](/changelog/vs-code-desktop-settings-sync)

Gitpod is built to be flexible. It’s important that our users can develop with the tools that make sense for their current task and use the tools they are most comfortable with. We “integrate, don’t dictate”. This design principle extends also to our [IDE and editor integrations](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/ides-and-editors) where we have multiple options in the browser and on desktop both VS Code and JetBrains (also see: [our partnership with JetBrains](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpod-jetbrains)).

We encourage Gitpod users to use [one workspace per task](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/introduction/learn-gitpod/one-workspace-per-task#ephemeral-vs-long-lived), move their development configurations to code, and embrace ephemerality to really get the most out of Gitpod. However, those users who choose to swap between VS Code Desktop and VS Code in the browser for editing code will have noticed that their VS Code settings (themes, plugins, and fonts, etc) weren’t kept in sync.

But since we know just how important it is for our users to have their setups and configurations just as they like them, we’re excited to let you know that **[VS Code settings sync](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/ides-and-editors/settings-sync) now works between VS Code Desktop and the browser in Gitpod**

**Note:** VS Code browser settings are already synced by default.

To enable VS Code settings sync on your desktop:

1. Open your Gitpod workspace in VS Code Desktop
2. Use the command palette to select “Settings Sync: Enable signing in with Gitpod”
3. Restart your VS Code Desktop
4. Resolve any settings conflicts between your browser and desktop

And you’re set! All your theme, plugins, and other settings will be synced in real-time and be reflected also when you’re working in VS Code in the browser.

Check out the [VS Code settings sync documentation](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/ides-and-editors/settings-sync) for more details.

Gitpod Classic
## [April Self-Hosted Release](/changelog/april-self-hosted-release)

We’ve released a new version of Self-Hosted Gitpod. You can read more on how to install it in our documentation. More details on this release can be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/releases).

For feedback, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.yml) or [chat with us](https://www.gitpod.io/chat).

### Fixes and improvements

**Self-signed certificates (beta)**

You can now use self-signed certificates (certificates that are not signed by a known public certificate authority) for your self-hosted Gitpod installation. This is especially useful if you want to run Gitpod in a corporate environment that uses a corporate certificate authority. You can find out more about self-signed certs in our TLS configuration guide.

Note: Self-signed certs are currently not supported on Google Cloud Platform (GKE) because you cannot get containerd to trust other certificates without being restarted.

**Support for installing Gitpod in air gapped Environments**

We’ve made it easier to install Gitpod in air gapped environments (an environment that is isolated to and from the internet). You can now get everything that you need to install Gitpod in a single bundle that you can then install into your air-gapped environment. You can learn more about installing in air gapped environments in our documentation.

**Improved Documentation**

We’ve been working on our documentation which now includes a revamped installation guide and a more detailed explanation of requirements Gitpod has on the cluster it runs on, as well as which components are needed to support it.

A full list of changes can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/releases).

Gitpod Classic
## [SSH directly into workspaces](/changelog/ssh-directly-into-workspaces)

As of today, in Gitpod you can now get access to a Gitpod workspace directly via SSH with a one-liner copy/paste from the Gitpod dashboard. All you have to do is visit the Gitpod dashboard, click the more actions menu at the right-hand side of your workspace list, copy/paste the SSH command into a terminal, and voila!

Choice and flexibility for developers to choose the right tool for the job is essential. Currently, for editing your code with Gitpod, you can use VS Code in the browser, VS Code on desktop, and using JetBrains IDE’s via JetBrains Gateway. Adding copy/paste SSH support makes it easier to work directly in your terminal, or for those times you need to hop into a Gitpod workspace. To use this feature, please follow our guide [our documentation](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/command-line)

Gitpod Classic
## [docker run --privileged](/changelog/docker-run---privileged)

You can now run privileged containers in Gitpod!

![language icon](/svg/docs/language.svg)
![language icon](/svg/docs/language-dark.svg)
bash

Copy code
Copy copied
```
# example
docker run --privileged -it busybox sh
```

Prior to [the fix](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/8827), users were getting [an error](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/2459), and it prevented them from running privileged workloads.

The host file system, in this case, is your Gitpod workspace. Don’t worry, it’s ephemeral!

## [Making snapshots safer for sharing](/changelog/making-snapshots-safer-for-sharing)

Gitpod now restricts access to workspaces opened with [snapshot URLs](/docs/configure/workspaces/collaboration#sharing-snapshots).

> Users must have access to the git repository in the snapshot, in order to open it.

If a snapshot URL user does not have read access to the repo, Gitpod will now show an error message.
Previously, any logged-in Gitpod user could open snapshot URLs for any workspace.

This change matches what happens when users open a new workspace on a private repository, using a prefixed context url. The change also helps to prevent leakage of sensitive or proprietary files via snapshots.
To learn more about collaboration and sharing, please have a look at [our documentation](/docs/configure/workspaces/collaboration)

**Breaking change**

This change may impact you if you are intentionally sharing a private repository using a snapshot, say for an interview.

**Workarounds**

* Use a public repository instead of a private one.
* Invite users to the private repository (or to the team on the org) as collaborators.
* Share a [running workspace](/docs/configure/workspaces/collaboration#sharing-running-workspaces) instead of a snapshot URL.

**Feedback**

As always, please [contact Gitpod](/contact/support) if you have any feedback to share with us.

## [Open in Gitpod](/changelog/open-in-gitpod)

It’s even easier now to open a repository in a new Gitpod workspace.

Type cmd+O (ctrl-O on Windows) while on any page in the dashboard at gitpod.io.

This will pop up an input where you can paste a [context URL](/docs/introduction/gitpod-tutorial/1-start-your-workspace#open-your-repository) for a git repository, and immediately open a workspace, just like you are used to with the `gitpod.io/#` prefix.

Instead of pasting a URL, you can start typing the name of a repository, and Gitpod will suggest repositories from recent workspaces, as well as from your connected git provider. Even our popular example [template repositories](/docs/introduction/getting-started#popular-templates) can be opened this way.

Always ready to code 🚀

Gitpod Classic
## [New workspace images built with Dazzle v2](/changelog/new-workspace-images-built-with-dazzle-v2)

By default, your Gitpod workspaces are based on a Docker image called `gitpod/workspace-full`. It contains all sorts of tools, SDKs and languages you may need — so you are ready-to-code with no friction.

What if you were only interested in Rust though, or Node.js LTS? You could create a custom Dockerfile, tell Gitpod about it and all would be fine. It would even be pretty simple to do.

At Gitpod, we are all about removing friction and frequently ask ourselves, “How can we improve?“. So we came up with an even easier solution. We are now in a position to create much more fine-grained workspace images!

To start this next era, we recently built a whole bunch of new images with [Dazzle v2](https://github.com/gitpod-io/dazzle). Dazzle is a Docker/OCI image builder and its goal is to build independent layers where a change to one layer does *not* invalidate the ones sitting “above” it.

Compared to the previous version of Dazzle, the new v2 is about 5x faster, more reliable and less hacky 🔨.

Here is a list of what you can use today:

* `gitpod/workspace-c`
* `gitpod/workspace-clojure`
* `gitpod/workspace-go`
* `gitpod/workspace-node`
* `gitpod/workspace-node-lts`
* `gitpod/workspace-python`
* `gitpod/workspace-ruby-2`
* `gitpod/workspace-ruby-3`
* `gitpod/workspace-rust`

For an up-to-date list of available images, please [refer to this list](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/blob/master/dazzle.yaml).

In your `.gitpod.yml`, all you need to do is add the following line:

![language icon](/svg/docs/language.svg)
![language icon](/svg/docs/language-dark.svg)
yml

Copy code
Copy copied
```
image: gitpod/workspace-xyz
```

As if this wasn’t exciting enough, this new solution lays the foundation for some very cool features you will be able to leverage directly to create custom images for your workspaces.

To tease this a bit more, imagine a future where you can pick & choose which tools you’d like to install in your workspace and Gitpod will automagically provide them to you at lightspeed, or thereabouts.

We are interested in your feedback and suggestions, please let us know in our dedicated [feedback issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/8207) or [chat with us](https://www.gitpod.io/chat).

Gitpod Classic
## [Project-level environment variables](/changelog/project-level-environment-variables)

It’s time to bring environment variables to Projects, and with that to Prebuilds as well!

Environment variables can now be set for individual Projects, which automatically makes them available when Gitpod runs a Prebuild for your project.

By default, these environment variables are **not accessible in workspaces**. You can, if you desire so, make them available in workspaces too. However, keep in mind that if you do so, anyone who starts a Gitpod workspace for your project will see the value of these environment variables.

To get started, make sure you have created a project at [gitpod.io/new](https://gitpod.io/new). You will then be able to visit its *Settings* page, where you find a new *Variables* section.

We are interested in your feedback and suggestions, please let us know in our dedicated [feedback issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/7860) or [chat with us](https://www.gitpod.io/chat).

## [Dotfiles support in Beta](/changelog/dotfiles-support-in-beta)

Happy new year from us at Gitpod 🥂!

We kick off 2022 with the availability of dotfiles support for anyone - currently in Beta.

If you are already familiar with dotfiles, [configure it in your Gitpod preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences). All we need is a URL to your dotfiles repository. We will do the rest whenever you start a new Gitpod workspace. Enjoy 😊.

**What are dotfiles, anyway?**

You may have seen a `.bashrc` file or similar in a Unix environment. Basically, a place for you to configure and customize your shell. The operating system runs commands in these dotfiles automatically. This ensures your environment always has your customizations applied when you start your computer.

Dotfiles allow you to really customize your workflow and hence can increae your productivity significantly. It’s well worth looking into.

With today’s announcement, you can now leverage these exact same files in all your Gitpod workspaces! This removes one more friction for anyone who’s been on the fence as to whether or not cloud-based developer environments are worth exploring. Invest an hour today, you may like what you find. Start at [gitpod.io/preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences).

Please try it out and share your experience with us and the Gitpod community. You can [learn more about Dotfiles](/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles) in the documentation.

We are interested in your feedback and suggestions, please let us know in our dedicated [feedback issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/7603) or [chat with us](https://www.gitpod.io/chat).

Gitpod Classic
## [Self-managed k3s on GCP](/changelog/self-managed-k3s-on-gcp)

Gitpod’s services run on Kubernetes and are what you would consider a “classic cloud-native application”. When you start a workspace for your project, we also run that on Kubernetes, but the requirements are very different from what Gitpod services need.

To run your workspaces, we deeply integrate with the Kernel, the container runtime and the Kubernetes control plane.

Up until recently, everything above ran on Google Cloud’s Kubernetes Engine (GKE). This continues to be the case for Gitpod’s services, but we moved user workspaces to self-managed k3s on GCP.

In short, this move brings better performance that will benefit your daily work, but also gets us closer to upstream and provides us with more flexibility. It is a foundation we put in place to build upon in the weeks and months to come!

Before you decide to follow our lead though, please see our CTO Chris’ [in-depth explanation](https://twitter.com/csweichel/status/1468239388115099669) of benefits, gotchas and overall details of this migration.

Gitpod Classic
## [JetBrains desktop available in beta](/changelog/jetbrains-desktop-available-in-beta)

Gitpod currently has **IntelliJ**, **GoLand**, **PhpStorm** and **PyCharm** released in beta. The rest of the JetBrains IDE’s are all coming to Gitpod very soon, watch this space!

Previously, when you loaded a new Gitpod workspace, you would find yourself in a VS Code Browser experience. Using a browser editor like VS Code Browser is the main way Gitpod can get you “ready to code” instantly.

However, whilst we know that VS Code is the [most widely adopted editor on the market](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-popular-technologies-integrated-development-environment) (which is why we started with VS Code), Gitpod is not only built for VS Code users!

Gitpod is for teams, and companies of all shapes and sizes. We’re here to support, and integrate with as many of the different developer workflows used in modern software development. After all, it’s your dev environment, so you should be able to set it up your way.

**And that’s why today, we’re happy to share that JetBrains desktop is now in beta!**

You can get started using the JetBrains IDE’s today by: heading over to your [Gitpod preferences page](https://gitpod.io/preferences), enabling your favourite JetBrains desktop IDE’s, and restarting any running workspaces. The next time you start a workspace, you’ll be prompted about which editor to use: VS Code Browser, VS Code Desktop, or your preferred JetBrains IDE. However, even when you open a Gitpod workspace with a desktop editor, you still get the ease and developer experience of using VS Code Browser to edit and work on the same workspace and code at the same time, they’re entirely synced.

Work on your desktop if you like, share your workspace if you like, the choice is yours! To keep an eye on which editors we support at any given time, check the [editors docs](/docs/references/ides-and-editors).

We are interested in your feedback and suggestions, please let us know in our dedicated [feedback issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576) or [chat with us](https://www.gitpod.io/chat).

## [Improved workspace startup times](/changelog/improved-workspace-startup-times)

Speeeed 🚀! When you start a new workspace, we changed how we clone your repository. Going forward, we have a two step approach:

1. Clone the most recent commit only (with the `depth=1` git flag)
2. About ten seconds later, we start to fetch 20 additional commits

Thanks to this, we let you start your work sooner while we fetch a few more commits. You can find the details of this change in the [#6464](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/6464) pull request.

## [Tailscale on Gitpod](/changelog/tailscale-on-gitpod)

With the availability of Tailscale support, you can connect Gitpod workspaces to other resources & services needed. Think of a database hosted behind a corporate firewall or in your on-prem data center.

Equally exciting is the possibility to connect multiple Gitpod workspaces with each other. Imagine a project with microservices which all have their own git repository. Configure Tailscale in each repository and once you start workspaces, the individual services will be able to communicate with each other.

You can learn more about this topic in our [Network Bridging](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/integrations/tailscale) documentation. Alternatively, we have a [template repository](https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-tailscale-with-gitpod) with the required configuration you can apply to your own projects.

Please let us know what you think via Twitter [@gitpod](https://twitter.com/gitpod) or chat with us at <https://www.gitpod.io/chat>.

Gitpod Classic
## [Introducing Teams and Projects](/changelog/introducing-teams-and-projects)

Up until today, you must have felt at times that your Gitpod dashboard is a pretty empty place 😔. All you had, besides settings and stuff, was a list of your active workspaces (not even old ones without changing the filter - yep yep, we fixed that too 😉).

> We are so stoked to announce **Teams & Projects (& Prebuilds)** available in beta 🎉

To get started right away, [gitpod.io/new](https://gitpod.io/new).

**Teams**

You can now create teams (as many as you want) and invite your co-workers, friends & family to collaborate on your projects.

**Projects**

Remember `.gitpod.yml`, checked in to your project’s root directory? It’s still the first place we look for Gitpod configuration, but when you create a project in the Gitpod dashboard, we now do our best to be smart and suggest a sensible default configuration for your project (insert something something machine learning - jk, there’s no magic).

**Bonus - Prebuilds 🤩**

Nobody asked me, but if they had I would have said the announcement should have been Teams, Projects & Prebuilds 😅. How come?

For the first time ever, we now show you each and every prebuild we run for your project! Check the status, view the logs or trigger new prebuilds from within the dashboard.

When you use the new onboarding workflow at [gitpod.io/new](https://gitpod.io/new), we help you kick off your first prebuild. With prebuilds, Gitpod builds your dev environment for each change you push to your repository. This means, when you’re ready to open a new workspace, it’ll already have all init start tasks executed.

You can learn more [in the docs](/docs/configure).

Expect more updates to all this over time. For now we’d love to hear about your experience. Please let us know in the [feedback issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/5095), contact us via Twitter [@gitpod](https://twitter.com/gitpod) or chat with us at <https://www.gitpod.io/chat>.

## [Automatic preview page reloads](/changelog/automatic-preview-page-reloads)

A small, but mighty improvement to your web application preview. No more manual page refresh when you open the preview before the application’s port is ready.

Gitpod now reloads the page every five seconds, automatically. Once your application listens on a port, the preview will reload and you’re ready to code.

Please let us know what you think via Twitter [@gitpod](https://twitter.com/gitpod) or chat with us at <https://www.gitpod.io/chat>.

![VS Code open in a Gitpod workspace with the option to open in local VS Code displayed](/images/changelog/2021-09-15.jpg)
Gitpod Classic
## [VS Code Desktop support](/changelog/vs-code-desktop-support)

It’s here 🎉! Starting today, you can access Gitpod workspaces right from your locally installed VS Code - we call it “VS Code Desktop Support”. Yep, that’s right - keep your local settings1 **and** benefit from Gitpod’s high-spec servers & automated prebuilds. As you would expect, your code continues to stay in an ephemeral Gitpod workspace which keeps each of your projects nicely isolated from one another.

To get started, all it takes is two steps:

1. Start a new Gitpod workspace ([learn how](/docs/introduction/getting-started) in the docs).
2. Open the command palette (
   CtrlCmd + Shift + P
   ), type “Open in VS Code” and hit
   Enter
   .

This opens your local VS Code, connects to the Gitpod workspace and let’s you develop, test & debug your application as if it was running locally.

We continue to enhance this feature, but for now we’d love to hear about your experience. Please let us know in the [feedback issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/5712), contact us via Twitter [@gitpod](https://twitter.com/gitpod) or chat with us at <https://www.gitpod.io/chat>.

If you are already familiar with the Local Companion app we announced in June, note that VS Code Desktop Support is built on top of it and you can continue to use the Local Companion app independently of VS Code.

1 may I add, yes this also means you get to keep your keyboard shortcuts just the way you prefer them. You know, Ctrl/Cmd + W to close an editor tab 😉.

![Faster workspace startup times](/images/changelog/2021-07-31.jpg)
Gitpod Classic
## [Faster workspace startup times](/changelog/faster-workspace-startup-times)

A key metric we deeply care about at Gitpod (and I’m sure you do, too) is workspace startup time. In a world where you create and dispose of workspaces many times per day, the last thing you want is waiting for a workspace to start 🐌.

In this release, we made significant progress in lowering startup times 🏎. What initially may sound like complex changes turned out to be a `+4 -4` pull request ([#4847](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/4847)). Yay simplicity!

To give you an idea of the magnitute of improvement we’re talking about, here’s a before / after comparison with 30 workspaces started twice:

| Before | Now |
| --- | --- |
| Plotted graph of workspace startup times ranging between 20s and 60s | Plotted graph of workspace startup times ranging between 5s and 20s |

Did you pay close attention to the y-axis? From between 20 to 60 seconds down to 5 to 20 seconds!

~~Great work team, let’s shift our focus to other features.~~ These improvements are certainly worth celebrating 🎂, but we’re hungry to drop these times by at least the same magnitude once or twice more! Team, finish your cake and get back to work 😉.

Please do let us know if you notice any differences with your project startup times. You can find us at [www.gitpod.io/chat](https://www.gitpod.io/chat).

## [Introducing the Gitpod Local Companion app](/changelog/introducing-the-gitpod-local-companion-app)

As of today, you can access your Gitpod workspace from your local environment 🎉!

**Why does this matter?**
Imagine you start a development server for your web application in Gitpod. You can preview that online at a <https://nnnn-x.y.gitpod.io> URL, where “nnnn” is the port your dev server listens on. Sometimes though, development features such as live reloading may not be compatible with that URL format and rather require something like http://localhost:10000 to communicate with the dev server.

With the Gitpod Local Companion app, localhost URLs can now access your dev server running in a Gitpod workspace. The best part of that: It works with any TCP port. You could run a MySQL database in your Gitpod workspace and access the database with your favourite GUI through localhost:3306.

To learn more and get started today, please see [our introduction blog post](/blog/local-app).

## [Faster, incremental prebuilds](/changelog/faster-incremental-prebuilds)

With [prebuilds](/docs/configure/repositories/prebuilds), Gitpod continuously builds your developer environment so that it is ready-to-code by the time you start a new workspace.

So far, Gitpod started each prebuild from a clean slate. With this latest release, Gitpod now supports incremental prebuilds, which means Gitpod will try to re-use a prebuild from an earlier commit in order to create new prebuilds faster. In short, it now takes less time for your prebuild to be ready after a new commit is pushed to your Git provider.

**Note**: This is a controlled feature release so that we can measure the performance impact on projects. There is nothing you need to do other than wait and at some point experience quicker prebuild times 🚀.

## [Synchronize Theia user settings with VS Code](/changelog/synchronize-theia-user-settings-with-vs-code)

We recently launched [support for VS Code](/blog/root-docker-and-vscode#vs-code).

If you switch your editor to VS Code, your user settings and extensions configured in Theia will be synchronized with VS Code automatically when you start a new workspace (unless you manually uploaded an extension).

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.
