## New features and improvements in Orion Platform

[Return to top](#top)

Orion Platform 2020.2.6 offers new features and improvements compared to previous releases of Orion Platform.

### Orion Account Improvements

* Improved password policy

  Starting with Orion Platform 2020.2.6, passwords for Orion individual accounts must use at least eight characters, combine lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters. SolarWinds recommends that you don't use dictionary words and don't substitute numbers for letter.

  Orion Platform 2020.2.6 includes updated password policies that impact individual Orion accounts. After you upgrade to 2020.2.6, all passwords for individual Orion accounts will expire in 30 days.
* Guest account was removed. For details on changes in service accounts, see [Manage Orion Service Accounts](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Manage-Orion-Service-Accounts?language=en_US).
* Lock out users for repeated failed login attempts

  If a user attempts to log in to the Orion Web Console and fails repeatedly, the account is locked out for 15 minutes (default). See [Unlock user accounts](../core-unlock-user-accounts.htm) for more details.

### Other updates

* New options for Syslog forwarding: you can use Syslog hostname field and original address field to forward messages to a different computer.
* The trap forwarding action was redesigned, using the Trap OID address to modify the incoming trap message and add the OID of the original sender address to trap varbindings.
* You can now export and import custom rules in the Log Viewer.
* If you are using the legacy Syslog and Traps function, note that it will be removed and replaced by Orion Log Viewer in a future release likely to occur in 2022.
* Collector and JobEngine are now using SQLite instead of MS SQL CE for internal cache (SDF files).
* New user interface for custom properties management.
* The web-based Account Limitation Builder application replaced the stand-alone application.

See [Orion Platform 2020.2.6 Administrator Guide](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/archive/pdf/orionplatform/Orion_Platform_2020-2-6_Administrator_Guide.pdf) for details.

### New security improvements in Orion Platform

Orion Platform 2020.2.6 offers new security improvements compared to previous releases of Orion Platform.

## New customer installation

[Return to top](#top)

For information about installing Orion Platform, see the [SolarWinds Orion Installer](https://www.solarwinds.com/documentation/kbloader.aspx?kb=MT88165).

## How to upgrade

If you are upgrading from **Orion Platform 2015.1.3 or later**, use the [SolarWinds Orion Installer](https://www.solarwinds.com/documentation/kbloader.aspx?kb=MT88165) to simultaneously upgrade your entire Orion deployment (all Orion Platform products and any scalability engines) to the current versions.

If you are upgrading from Orion Platform 2019.2, you can upgrade your entire Orion deployment from the My Orion Deployment page. Click Settings > My Orion Deployment > Updates & Evaluations. Downloading the Orion Installer is no longer necessary.

If you are upgrading from **an earlier Orion Platform version**, use [this topic](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/OrionPlatform/Content/Install-LegacyInstWalkThrough.htm) to plan and implement an upgrade to the current version of Orion Platform.
