Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-35220:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- EmailWebPage Command Injection. The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in how the SolarWinds Orion Platform handles email web page commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The system fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input when generating email web page commands. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands.
- Insecure Deserialization (Implied): While not explicitly stated, command injection vulnerabilities often involve insecure deserialization when handling data, which is likely the case here.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected server. This can lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, likely through network requests to the web interface.
- Web interface: The vulnerable functionality is accessible through the web interface of the Orion Platform.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Orion Platform.
- "Alerting Mgmt" permission:  The attacker must have "Alerting Mgmt" permission to access the vulnerable functionality.
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable system.
- Knowledge of the specific vulnerable endpoints or features
