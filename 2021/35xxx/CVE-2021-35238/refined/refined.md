Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35238:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "CreateExternalWebsite" functionality. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the application handles a URL POST parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored in the application's database. These scripts are executed when a user accesses the affected functionality, making it a stored or persistent XSS.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the URL POST parameter before storing it, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session, potentially allowing the attacker to:
  - Steal session cookies.
  - Impersonate users.
  - Redirect users to malicious websites.
  - Perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL POST Parameter:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload within the URL POST parameter targeting the "CreateExternalWebsite" function.
- **Admin Privileges:** To inject the XSS payload, the attacker needs to have Orion admin rights.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User with Admin Privileges:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Orion Platform with administrative rights to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know which URL POST parameter is vulnerable to XSS in the `CreateExternalWebsite` functionality.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in Orion Platform 2020.2.6 HF1.
- The CVSS score is 7.1 High.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Kajetan Rostojek.
- The vulnerability is categorized as a Stored XSS vulnerability
