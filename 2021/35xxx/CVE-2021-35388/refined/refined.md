Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-35388 (Although this is a placeholder, the content clearly describes a vulnerability)

**Vulnerability Description:** The provided content describes a reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a Hospital Management System (HMS) project, specifically version 4.0, which can be downloaded from the provided URL.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `patient-search.php` page.
- Specifically, when a user enters a malicious payload into the search field, this input is reflected back in the page's output without proper encoding/escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflective XSS:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization or output encoding, leading to a reflective XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page viewed by the victim (an admin user in this case).
- This allows the attacker to potentially:
  - Steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information.
  - Redirect users to malicious sites.
  - Deface the web page.
  - Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted search query in the `/Hospital%20Management%20System%20Project/hospital/hms/admin/patient-search.php` page's search field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious search query.
- The attacker does not need to have prior access to the system, other than the ability to access the vulnerable web page.
- The victim must be an authenticated admin user who accesses the crafted link (or search).
- The attacker can achieve this by:
  - Sending a crafted link to the admin, which includes the malicious query
  - Directly inputting the crafted payload into the search field if they have admin access.

**Technical Details**
- The provided exploit uses the following payload: `">[![](/BigTiger2020/Hospital-Management-System/raw/main/1)](/BigTiger2020/Hospital-Management-System/blob/main/1)` which results in a pop-up alert. This payload demonstrates how a malicious script tag can be injected into the page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content explicitly names the affected page `patient-search.php`.
- The github content provides images to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is specific to version 4.0 of the Hospital Management System and indicates the location to download the vulnerable software.
