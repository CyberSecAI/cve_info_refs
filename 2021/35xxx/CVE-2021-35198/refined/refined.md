The provided content includes information about CVE-2021-35198.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability within the nGeniusONE product. Specifically, the vulnerability resides in the packet module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, which are then stored and executed when other users access the affected functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various impacts, such as:
   - Session hijacking
   - Defacement of the application
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites
   - Stealing sensitive data
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability through the upload functionality of the packet analysis module.
- A normal user can trigger the stored XSS by visiting a specific part of the packet module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a normal user of the nGeniusONE application.
- The attacker does not need high privileges to inject the malicious script.
- The attacker needs some knowledge of crypto to exploit the upload functionality where the vulnerability exists.
