  "cveId": "CVE-2021-35331",
  "description": "** DISPUTED ** In Tcl 8.6.11, a format string vulnerability in nmakehlp.c might allow code execution via a crated file. NOTE: multiple third parties dispute the significance of this finding.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The `printf` function in `SubstituteFile` uses a format string that originates from user-controlled input (`argv[3]`).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Format string vulnerability (CWE-134)"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution could be possible if a malicious format string is provided as input.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Local file manipulation/crafted input file"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to control the content of the file that is processed by the vulnerable `nmakehlp.exe` utility via the command line argument argv[3]. This could be achieved by having write access to the file system on the machine where nmakehlp.exe is run."
  },
    "additionalDetails": {
      "dispute": "Multiple third parties dispute the significance of this finding, stating the program is not part of the main project and is only used during build process, it doesn't represent a security risk for the end-user.",
          "remediation": "The vulnerable `printf` was replaced with `printf(\"%s\", szBuffer)` in commit [28ef6c0c74](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tcl/info/28ef6c0c741408a2)."
