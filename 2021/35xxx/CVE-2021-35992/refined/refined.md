The provided content is related to CVE-2021-35992.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, meaning the software attempts to read data from a memory location outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to perform an arbitrary file system read. This means an attacker could potentially read sensitive files from the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker must have local access to the system.
- The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), meaning the user must perform some action for the exploit to be successful, such as opening a malicious file or document.
- No privileges are required (PR:N) for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable system.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to interact with the exploit to trigger the vulnerability.
