- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Session cookies were not reset after authentication for public links.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Session Fixation (CWE-384)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially hijack a user's session by exploiting the predictable session cookie. This could allow them to impersonate the user and potentially gain access to their files or other resources. The impact is rated as low with a CVSS base score of 3.9
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user authenticates via a public link without a session reset.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to intercept or predict the session cookie of the user and then be able to trick them into using the session. The attacker needs to be in a position to observe the session ID before the user authenticates with the public link. The user interaction is required to complete the attack, which is reflected in the "UI:R" vector in the CVSS score.
