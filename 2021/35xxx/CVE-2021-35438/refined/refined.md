Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application's IP calculator was vulnerable to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. The input provided to the IP calculator was not properly sanitized or encoded before being displayed back to the user.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected XSS. The application echoes user-supplied input without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the IP calculator input field, which, when rendered by the application, would execute in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    *   Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Displaying misleading content.
*  **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the IP calculator input field, where the attacker injects the malicious script.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to submit input to the IP calculator through the application's user interface. No special privileges or access is needed other than the ability to use the IP calculator feature.

**Additional details**:
*   The specific payload used to trigger the XSS was `127.0.0.1/24/**/<script>alert(/xss/)</script>`.
*   The vulnerability was present in version 1.4.3.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in commit `beb97bf18f911ada045262bfc61dfe2aaffb4bdb`
