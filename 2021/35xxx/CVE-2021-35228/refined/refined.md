Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-35228:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to missing input sanitization of an output field that is extracted from HTTP headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled data from HTTP headers before including it in the output of the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a user's browser by manipulating HTTP headers. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, information theft, or defacement of the web page, all within the context of the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is required.
- The attacker needs to intercept and modify the HTTP headers between the victim and the SolarWinds DPA server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned in a network where they can intercept and modify HTTP traffic between the victim and the vulnerable SolarWinds DPA server.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the HTTP headers to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- The attack requires user interaction, since the injected script is executed when the user requests the manipulated page.

**Affected Product:**
- SolarWinds DPA v2021.3.7388

**Fixed Version**
- SolarWinds DPA v2021.3.7438

**CVSS Score**
