Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-35042:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input being passed to the `QuerySet.order_by()` function in Django.
- A regression introduced in Django 3.1 as a side effect of fixing another issue (#31426) caused the column reference validation in `QuerySet.order_by()` to be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** By bypassing the column reference validation, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the `ORDER BY` clause of a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a potential SQL injection, allowing an attacker to:
   - Disclose sensitive information stored in the database.
   - Add or modify data within the database.
   - Cause Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by executing resource-intensive or malformed queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through user input that is passed to the `QuerySet.order_by()` function. 
- This input is not properly sanitized or validated against a list of acceptable column names.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input that is used in `QuerySet.order_by()` function
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Django versions 3.1.x prior to 3.1.13 and 3.2.x prior to 3.2.5.
- The vulnerability is rated as "high" severity by the Django team.
- The issue is not present in the main branch of Django as the vulnerable, deprecated path has been removed.
- The fix involves restoring the strict column reference validation that was unintentionally removed.
