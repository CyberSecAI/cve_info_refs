## New customer installation

[Return to top](#Top)

For information about installing Web Help Desk, see the [Web Help Desk Installation and Upgrade Guide](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/whd/content/whd_installation_guide.htm).

After you complete the installation, see the [Web Help Desk Getting Started Guide](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/whd/content/whd_getting_started_guide.htm). This guide picks up right after the installation process and walks you through the initial steps you need to start using the application.

Web Help Desk no longer includes the additional configuration files required to enable Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) mode in the application. To install Web Help Desk and enable FIPS, see [Enable FIPS in a new deployment](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/whd/content/helpdeskenablingfipsnewdeployment.htm) located in the Web Help Desk Administrator Guide.

To install Web Help Desk 12.7.8 with FIPS mode disabled, install version 12.7.8 on the host server. When the installation is completed, enable FIPS mode.

### SQL Server database collation requirements

If you plan to use a Microsoft SQL Server database for your deployment, verify that the server collation in your database is set to case insensitive before you run the installer. If it is set to case sensitive, create a new case insensitive database using SQL Server Management Studio.

See [Prepare your Web Help Desk database](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/WHD/Content/HelpDeskPrepareWHDDatabase.htm) in the Web Help Desk Administrator Guide for details.

## How to upgrade

[Return to top](#Top)

If you are upgrading from a previous version, see the [Web Help Desk Installation and Upgrade Guide](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/whd/content/whd_installation_guide.htm). This guide provides steps and procedures for installing and upgrading Web Help Desk in an evaluation, stand-alone, or integrated Orion deployment.

### Upgrade your embedded PostgreSQL database

If you are running version 12.7.7 with the embedded PostgreSQL 13.3 database, follow the instructions in the Web Help Desk Installation and Upgrade Guide to upgrade your deployment to version 12.7.8.

If you are located outside the continental United States, [contact Technical Support](https://www.solarwinds.com/company/contact-us) for assistance with upgrading to Web Help Desk 12.7.7 with the embedded PostgreSQL 13.3 database.

If you are running version 12.7.6 or earlier with the embedded PostgreSQL 9.x.x database, upgrade to 12.7.7 with PostgreSQL 13.3 first. See [How to upgrade Web Help Desk to version 12.7.7 using PostgreSQL as the database](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/How-to-upgrade-Web-Help-Desk-to-version-12-7-7-using-PostgreSQL-as-the-Database) for details. When you are finished, follow the instructions in the Web Help Desk Installation and Upgrade Guide to upgrade your deployment to version 12.7.8.

### Upgrade your FIPS deployment

If FIPS is enabled in your Web Help Desk 12.7.2 through 12.7.4 deployment, copy the following files to another location before you upgrade:

* `<WebHelpDesk>\bin\nss-x64`
* `<WebHelpDesk>\conf\additional\fips-140-2`

After you copy the files, upgrade to 12.7.5. When you are finished, upgrade to 12.7.8. See the Web Help Desk Installation and Upgrade Guide for details.

### Install the MySQL JDBC driver

Beginning with Web Help Desk 12.7.1, Oracle Java is replaced with the Open Java Development Kit (OpenJDK). This update modifies the directory structure where the MySQL Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver is installed. To prevent errors after the upgrade, install the driver on your host server in the new location to prevent errors in the application after the upgrade.

See [Install the MySQL JDBC Driver](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/WHD/Content/HelpDeskInstallMySQLJDBCDriver.htm) in the Web Help Desk Administrator Guide for installation instructions.

### Upgrade your Apache Tomcat software

The software installer includes Apache Tomcat 9.0.56, which provides enhanced security and is required for this release.

When you upgrade your Web Help Desk software, the upgrade procedure replaces the `<WebHelpDesk>\conf\tomcat_web_template.xml` file with an updated file that includes the Tomcat 9.0.56 settings.

Before you upgrade, back up your current `tomcat_web_template.xml` file to an external directory. When the upgrade is completed, add your personal settings to the updated file from your backup file.
