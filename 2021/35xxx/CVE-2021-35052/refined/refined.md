Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-35052

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists within the Kaspersky Password Manager Service due to execution with unnecessary privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Privilege Management.
- Unnecessary privileges assigned to the Kaspersky Password Manager Service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can escalate privileges from medium integrity to high integrity, executing code in the context of the current user with elevated privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attack: An attacker must already have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system with low privileges.
- Local access to the system.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability arises because the Kaspersky Password Manager Service runs with excessive privileges, enabling a local attacker with low-level access to escalate privileges and execute code at a higher level.
