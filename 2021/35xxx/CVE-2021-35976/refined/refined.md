Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-35976:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw in the website preview feature of Plesk Obsidian on Linux. This occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `/plesk-site-preview/` path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Reflected XSS:  The application echoes unvalidated user input back in the response, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the origin used for the website preview. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking: An attacker could steal session cookies and impersonate the victim.
    - Phishing: An attacker could redirect the user to a malicious website or display a fake login form to steal credentials.
    - Website Defacement:  The attacker could potentially modify the content of the previewed website.
    - Other malicious actions within the scope of the preview domain.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in the path normally used to specify the domain to preview.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker only needs to craft a malicious URL and get a victim to visit that link via the `/plesk-site-preview/` path.
- No prior authentication is required for successful exploitation of the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network.

**Affected Versions**

- Plesk Obsidian 18.0.0 through 18.0.32 on Linux are vulnerable.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability is specific to the website preview feature and does not affect the rest of the Plesk panel.

- The provided content includes a demonstration payload:  `"><svg/onload=alert()>`.
