```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'SEARCH' parameter within the 'dotAdmin/#/c/containers' and 'dotAdmin/#/c/links' URLs.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as transmitting private data (cookies, session information), redirecting to malicious content, or performing actions on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the payload embedded in the 'SEARCH' parameter. When the victim accesses this URL through a web browser, the script executes.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to craft and deliver the malicious URL to a victim who is logged into the dotCMS admin panel. The attacker does not need prior access to the system beyond this."
