Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-35061:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization of user-supplied data in the DRK Odenwaldkreis Testerfassung web portal. Specifically, data from HTML form fields was not being filtered, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple XSS vulnerabilities were found in the web application's forms. This allowed attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML.
- **Lack of Input Filtering:** The application failed to filter user input from `$_POST` and `$_GET` variables, leading to the vulnerability.
- **Missing Sanitization:** The application does not use appropriate sanitization techniques such as `strip_tags()` or input validation to remove or neutralize potentially malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code within the context of the vulnerable web application.
- This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing user cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacement of the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious code via HTML form fields in the web application.
- Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating parameters in the URL using `$_GET` requests (as shown in the example: `result.php?TOKEN=">1234567890&ID=[NUMBER]`).
- It can also be triggered through `$_POST` requests by injecting malicious code into form fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- They can exploit the vulnerability using the web browser or other tools to send malicious parameters.
-  A valid test token is required for the Shell Metacharacter Injection vulnerability, which is related to CVE-2021-35062

**Mitigation:**
- The primary mitigation is to implement proper input sanitization.
- The content suggests using the PHP function `strip_tags()` to remove HTML and JavaScript tags from user input.
- It also recommends using an allow list of allowed characters.
- The application should also cast the type of variables to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected input.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was reported to the developers and fixed in later releases.
- The disclosure timeline followed a responsible disclosure process with a 90-day delay before public disclosure.
- The content mentions a related Shell Metacharacter Injection vulnerability (CVE-2021-35062), but the primary focus here is on XSS (CVE-2021-35061).
