    - Defacement of the user interface
    - Unauthorized actions within the application

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves uploading a specially crafted file via the Packet Analysis module's upload functionality. This file contains the malicious XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account with the ability to upload files to the Packet Analysis module.
- Some crypto knowledge may be required to craft the malicious file to bypass any client-side validation.
- No high privileges are required; a normal user account can exploit this vulnerability.
