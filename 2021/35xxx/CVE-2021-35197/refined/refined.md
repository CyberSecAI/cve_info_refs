Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-35197:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in MediaWiki's API and purge functionality. Specifically, blocked users were not prevented from issuing purge requests through the API or `index.php`, which was not the intended behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The core weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks for blocked users attempting to perform purge actions. The code did not explicitly prevent blocked users from triggering purges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The ability for blocked users to issue purges could lead to a denial-of-service condition. This is because purges can trigger resource-intensive operations, and malicious blocked users could exploit this by repeatedly purging pages, overwhelming the server.
- **Integrity issues:** Allowing blocked users to purge pages means they can bypass the intended effect of the block which is to stop them making modifications and impacting the wiki.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **API access:** An attacker could use the MediaWiki API to send purge requests, bypassing the intended restrictions.
- **`index.php` access:** Attackers could also potentially send purge requests through the `index.php` interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Blocked User Account:** The attacker needs a user account that has been blocked on the MediaWiki instance.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the MediaWiki instance, either directly or through the API.

**Additional Details from Content:**

- **Patches:** The fix involved removing the `requiresUnblock` override in `PurgeAction` and adding a check in the API to verify if the user is blocked before allowing purge requests. This check reuses the code from `ApiTag`:
```
		// Fail early if the user is sitewide blocked.
		$block = $user->getBlock();
		if ( $block && $block->isSitewide() ) {
			$this->dieBlocked( $block );
		}
```
- **Versions Affected:**  MediaWiki versions prior to 1.36.1, 1.35.3, 1.31.15 and 1.27.7 are vulnerable.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was resolved by applying the patches described above which were implemented in MediaWiki versions 1.31.15, 1.35.3, 1.36.1, and later.
- **Severity:**  The issue was classified as having a low severity.
- **Fedora and Debian:** Both Fedora and Debian released updates to address this vulnerability.
