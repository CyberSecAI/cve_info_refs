Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-35505:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `checkImageMagick` action within the Filerun application's image preview settings. This action allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands by manipulating the `path` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Command Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input passed to the `path` parameter of the `checkImageMagick` action. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed by the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the web server user. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to the `/` endpoint with specific parameters. The request must include the vulnerable `module=cpanel&section=settings&page=image_preview&action=checkImageMagick` parameters.
- **`mode` and `path` Parameters:** The `mode` parameter must be set to `exec` and the `path` parameter is used to inject the malicious command.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the Filerun admin panel to exploit this vulnerability. This can be achieved by first exploiting CVE-2021-35503 for example which is an unauthenticated Stored XSS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs a valid session cookie. This can be acquired by exploiting the XSS vulnerability (CVE-2021-35503) or by obtaining credentials.
- Access to the Filerun admin panel is required to access and exploit the `checkImageMagick` action.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint, typically via a web browser or command-line tools.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- **Exploit Chain:** The content highlights that CVE-2021-35505 can be chained with CVE-2021-35503, which is a stored XSS vulnerability. The XSS can be used to inject Javascript into the Activity Log Feed, which will then trigger the RCE upon the administrator visiting the page, by using the vulnerable `checkImageMagick` endpoint.
- **Proof of Concept:** A proof-of-concept exploit is available on Exploit-DB (EDB-ID: 50313), which utilizes this chain.
- **Vendor Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in Filerun version 2021.06.27.
- **Payload Example:** The provided exploit demonstrates how to create a `shell.php` file via command injection and then use it to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
