- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unquoted service path vulnerability in the Kiwi CatTools Installation Wizard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The service path was not enclosed in quotes, allowing the execution of arbitrary code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker could gain escalated privileges by inserting an executable into the path of the affected service or uninstall entry. This could lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have access to the system where Kiwi CatTools is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires local access and the ability to insert a malicious executable into a directory within the unquoted service path. The attacker also needs high privileges to install the malicious service.
