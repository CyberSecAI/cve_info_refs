      "root_cause": "The fix for CVE-2017-7500 and CVE-2017-7501 was incomplete, only checking the parent directory for unsafe symlinks instead of all ancestor directories.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "CWE-59"
      ],
      "impact": "A local unprivileged user who owns an ancestor directory can exploit this flaw to gain root privileges, leading to compromise of data confidentiality and integrity, and system availability.",
       "attack_vectors": [
          "Local"
        ],
      "required_capabilities": "A local unprivileged user must own an ancestor directory within the system.",
        "more_information":"The attack requires a directory structure to exist at both where rpm operates and the files the attacker wants to control. For example, a compromised 'matomo' user could create a symlink /srv/www/matomo/core/Tracker/Db -> /usr/share/icingaweb2/library/vendor/Zend/Db/Adapter/ and on the next update of matomo, RPM would replace the 'Pdo/Mysql.php' of icinga2 and give ownership of it to the 'matomo' user."
