Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a combination of multiple vulnerabilities in the NETGEAR WAC104 access point's firmware. The vulnerabilities, when chained together, allow an attacker to gain a root shell on the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **HTTP Authentication Bypass (mini\_httpd):**
    *   The device uses a flag to skip authentication checks based on certain conditions in the HTTP request.
    *   The flag is set when specific substrings ("setupwizard.cgi", "currentsetting.htm") or a specific SOAPAction header are found in the request URI or headers.
    *   The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication by inserting a null byte (`%00`) before "currentsetting.htm" in the URI or by adding `currentsetting.htm` as a query parameter.
    *   This bypass grants access to any CGI script through a GET request.

2.  **.bss section Buffer Overflow in HTTP header processing (mini\_httpd):**
    *   A buffer overflow exists in the processing of the "SOAPAction:" HTTP header.
    *   The code copies data from the header into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking.
    *   This vulnerability is considered less exploitable because it causes the server to exit early. However, it may be possible to exploit it to obtain read/write capabilities.

3.  **Unverified Password Change (setup.cgi):**
    *   The `setup.cgi` script has an action (`con_save_passwd`) that allows changing the admin password in NVRAM without requiring the old password.
    *   This action is accessible via GET requests, and does not have CSRF protection.
    *   The password change needs a reboot to propagate to /etc/passwd and /etc/htpasswd files.

4.  **Session ID Verification Bypass (setup.cgi):**
    *   `setup.cgi` checks if a session ID in a POST request matches the ID stored in a session file.
    *   The file name is derived from the `sp` parameter in the request, and can be manipulated.
    *   If the session file does not exist the function returns 0. This allows an attacker to send `id=0&sp=ABC` and bypass the session check.
    *   The session ID is 32 bits, which is easily brute-forcible.

5.  **/tmp/etc Directory Permission Issue:**
    *   The `/tmp/etc` directory has permissions set to 777.
    *   Although `admin` user cannot modify `/etc/passwd` directly, they can rename it due to the directory permissions. This allows them to add a new user with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can gain a root shell on the device.
*   The device can be completely taken over.
*   Allows for full control over the device and network.
*   Can be used for further attacks or lateral movement inside the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **LAN-based attack:** An attacker within the same local network can exploit the vulnerabilities directly via HTTP.
*   **Internet-based reflected attack:** An attacker can trick a user on the LAN to visit a malicious website. This website can then send HTTP requests to the router to exploit the auth bypass.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **LAN-based attacker:** Must be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.
*   **Internet-based reflected attack:** Needs to lure a user on the LAN to visit a malicious website or cause them to open a malicious link.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is a missed variant of a previously known vulnerability in other NETGEAR devices.
*   The exploit chain involves multiple steps, such as bypassing authentication, changing the password, and exploiting the directory permission issue to gain root privileges.
*   The report also includes a proof-of-concept exploit in Python.
*   The device firmware code quality was deemed poor.
*   The advisory also mentions the WNDR3700v5 model might be vulnerable, but no fix is coming.
