- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper error handling when processing public share links with specific query parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Generation of an error message containing sensitive information (CWE-209) such as the internal path and username of the share owner.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Disclosure of sensitive information like internal file paths and usernames.
- **Attack vectors**: By appending certain characters to the query parameters of a public share link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have access to a public share link and be able to modify its query parameters.
