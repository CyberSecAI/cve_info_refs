- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application allows the user to select a custom directory for image transfers. When the "Change..." button is clicked, a "Save As" prompt appears, which allows the user to navigate the file system. By entering `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` into the address bar of this prompt, the user can execute a command prompt with administrative privileges. This indicates that the "Save As" dialog is not properly restricted and executes the provided path as a program.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of file paths in the "Save As" dialog, leading to command execution. The application does not validate the selected path or sanitize the input, allowing an arbitrary program to be launched with elevated privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local Privilege Escalation, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with Administrator privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the vulnerable application's user interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to interact with the Remote Mouse GUI application on a local Windows system where the application is installed.
