Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The SES Evolution agent process `EsScriptHost` loads Visual C++ Runtime (VCRuntime) DLLs from the Windows directory instead of the agent's installation folder.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **DLL Hijacking:** The vulnerability is a DLL hijacking issue, where a legitimate process loads DLLs from an insecure location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Malicious Code Injection:** An attacker can replace legitimate VCRuntime DLLs in the Windows directory with malicious versions. This allows the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code within the context of the `EsScriptHost` process.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The exploit can lead to high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attacker must be present on the local machine.
- **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker requires administrative privileges to replace DLLs in the Windows directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have administrative access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
- The attacker needs to be able to write files to the Windows directory.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Product:** Stormshield Endpoint Security (SES) Evolution
- **Affected Versions:** SES Evolution versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.2
- **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in SES Evolution version 2.1.0
