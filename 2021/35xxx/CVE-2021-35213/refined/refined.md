Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-35213:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **Improper Access Control** issue within the `SaveUserSetting` endpoint of the SolarWinds Orion Platform. This endpoint is responsible for handling user settings, but lacks proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An authenticated user with low privileges (specifically a guest user) can exploit the vulnerability to elevate their privileges to that of an Administrator.
*   **Improper Access Control:** The `SaveUserSetting` endpoint does not properly restrict access, allowing unauthorized users to modify settings they shouldn't be able to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** By gaining administrator-level access, an attacker could potentially perform a wide range of malicious activities, such as:
    *   Gaining complete control over the SolarWinds Orion Platform instance
    *   Accessing and modifying sensitive data
    *   Disrupting normal operations
    *   Deploying further attacks within the environment

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the network.
*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker must have valid credentials to log in to the Orion Platform, even with guest level permissions.
*   **Specific Endpoint:** The attack targets the `/SaveUserSetting` endpoint within the Orion Platform.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user on the SolarWinds Orion Platform with minimal privileges.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the Orion Platform instance.
