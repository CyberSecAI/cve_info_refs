The provided content relates to CVE-2021-35265.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue due to insufficient sanitization of the `REQUEST_URI` server variable when building URLs, specifically within the MaxSite CMS. The CMS does not properly sanitize user input in the URL, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `REQUEST_URI` variable, specifically when generating URLs within the CMS.
- Lack of adequate protection against XSS attacks.
- The CMS's existing protection mechanisms were not comprehensive enough to prevent the exploitation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web pages.
- This can lead to various malicious activities including, but not limited to:
  - Stealing user session cookies.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing websites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the `REQUEST_URI`, which can be manipulated by an attacker to include malicious code.
- The vulnerability was triggered by crafting a URL with an XSS payload (e.g., `http://localhost/maxsite/page/hello/1%22%3E%3Csvg/onload=alert(1)%3E`) which was not properly sanitized by the CMS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with malicious JavaScript code.
- The attacker has to induce a user to visit the crafted URL.
- No special access or authentication is required, making this vulnerability easily exploitable.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a GitHub issue (#414) that reports the vulnerability, and a commit that addresses it.
- The commit (6b0ab1d) modifies several files (`format.php`, `url.php`, `global_cache/index.php`, and `sape/index.php`) to sanitize the `REQUEST_URI` using the `mso_clean_str()` function, mitigating the XSS risk.
- The reported vulnerability specifically used an SVG `onload` event to execute JavaScript (`<svg/onload=alert(1)>`) within the URL.
- The reporter requests a CVE for the vulnerability.
