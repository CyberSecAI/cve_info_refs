Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-35941:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing authentication check in the `system_factory_restore.php` file, which handles factory reset operations on Western Digital My Book Live and My Book Live Duo devices.
*   A refactor in April 2011 centralized authentication logic into `includes/component_config.php`. While the authentication logic in `system_factory_restore.php` was disabled, the corresponding authentication type `ADMIN_AUTH_LAN_ALL` was not added to `component_config.php`. This oversight left the factory reset function unauthenticated.
*   The code that would have required authentication before factory reset was commented out, effectively removing the password protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Factory Reset:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to perform a factory reset without any authentication. This allows an attacker to remotely wipe all data on the device.
*   **Command Injection (CVE-2018-18472):**  While not CVE-2021-35941, this vulnerability was often exploited in conjunction with the unauthenticated factory reset. It allowed attackers to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Loss:** The most significant impact is the complete erasure of data stored on the affected devices through a factory reset.
*   **Malware Installation:** Attackers exploited CVE-2018-18472 to install malicious software, including a trojan named `.nttpd,1-ppc-be-t1-z` which could enable botnet participation.
*   **Device Disruption:** The factory reset renders the device unusable until it's reconfigured by the user.
*   **Potential Botnet Participation**: Exploited devices can be used for malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network if the device has remote access enabled.
*   **Direct Internet Connection:** The devices can be directly exposed to the internet through port forwarding, making them discoverable via port scanning.
*   **Exploitation via XML Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specific XML request to the `system_factory_restore.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable device.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker would need to be aware of the system_factory_restore.php endpoint and the proper XML payload to trigger the reset.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The unauthenticated factory reset vulnerability means that the attacker does not need any valid credentials to perform a factory reset.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE description)**
*   The vulnerability was introduced in April 2011 as part of a firmware refactor.
*   Attackers used the command injection vulnerability (CVE-2018-18472) to install a malicious binary and later used the unauthenticated reset to wipe the devices.
*   Multiple attackers were potentially involved, with one potentially patching the command injection vulnerability on compromised devices with a password. This indicates potential competition between attackers for control of the botnet.
*   Western Digital provided a data recovery service and a trade-in program.
*   The vulnerability does not affect the current My Cloud product family.
