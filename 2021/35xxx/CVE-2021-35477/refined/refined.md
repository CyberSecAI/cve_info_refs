{
  "CVE-2021-35477": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The BPF verifier's technique to manage speculation for memory store operations is unreliable, leading to a speculative store bypass.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Speculative store bypass vulnerability due to incorrect assumptions about the completion speed of preemptive stores by the BPF verifier. Specifically, a preemptive store of zero, intended to sanitize memory locations before an actual store, can be bypassed if a dependent load executes speculatively ahead of it. The assumption that the preemptive store is always fast is invalidated by scenarios where dependent loads execute speculatively ahead of it.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An unprivileged BPF program can disclose the content of arbitrary kernel memory via a side-channel attack.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation occurs through a crafted BPF program that leverages the speculative store bypass vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute a BPF program on the vulnerable system, requiring local access but not necessarily root privileges."
