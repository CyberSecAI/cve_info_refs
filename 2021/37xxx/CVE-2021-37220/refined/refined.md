Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37220:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in MuPDF's cached color converter.
- The color converter uses a hash table to cache color conversions.
- The cached color converter does not properly check or enforce the maximum key size of the hash table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** When a color conversion key exceeds the maximum size allowed by the hash table, it results in an out-of-bounds write. This occurs when writing into the hash table.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The out-of-bounds write leads to a segmentation fault (SEGV) and program termination, as indicated by the AddressSanitizer output. This can be triggered via `mutool draw`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed input file:** A specially crafted file (e.g., a PDF or XPS file) containing color conversion data that results in keys exceeding the hash table limit. Specifically, the provided PoC file in the `poc.txt` attachment triggers the vulnerability when processed with `mutool draw`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted file to a user or application that utilizes MuPDF (e.g., `mutool draw`).
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the target system to trigger the vulnerability; the vulnerable code is executed within the application's context.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided bug report (Bug 703791) contains a PoC file (`poc.txt`) that triggers the crash.
* The vulnerability has been fixed with commit `f5712c9949d026e4b891b25837edd2edc166151f`, which ensures that the hash table's max key size is not exceeded during color conversions.
* The fix is included in the python-PyMuPDF update to version 1.19.1-1.fc34.
* This vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write that results in a denial of service.
