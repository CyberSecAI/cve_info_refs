Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37664:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check in the `BoostedTreesSparseCalculateBestFeatureSplit` operation within TensorFlow. Specifically, the code does not validate that the `stat_dim` value extracted from `stats_summary_indices` is within the bounds defined by `stats_dims` (the last value in `stats_summary_shape`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap Out-of-Bounds Read:**  The primary vulnerability is a heap out-of-bounds read. If `stat_dim` is greater than or equal to `stats_dims`, the code accesses memory outside of the allocated buffer, leading to potential information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read data from arbitrary memory locations on the heap, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Input:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing specially crafted inputs to the `BoostedTreesSparseCalculateBestFeatureSplit` operation. This involves manipulating the `stats_summary_indices` tensor to include a `stat_dim` value that exceeds the bounds of the `stats_dims` value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to call the `tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesSparseCalculateBestFeatureSplit` operation with chosen inputs. This implies that the attacker must have some control over the TensorFlow graph being executed or the inputs being fed to it.
- No specific privilege is mentioned but the ability to call the vulnerable function is necessary.

**Additional Information:**

- The provided example code snippet demonstrates a way to trigger the vulnerability.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that `stat_dim < stats_dims`.
- Patches were made in versions 2.3.4, 2.4.3, and 2.5.1.
- The vulnerability was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
