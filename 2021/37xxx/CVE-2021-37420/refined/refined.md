Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-37420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `/RestAPI/PasswordSelfServiceAPI` endpoint of ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus. Specifically, the `ACTION_TO_PERFORM` parameter, intended to carry self-service actions, is vulnerable to MIME injection. An attacker can inject malicious MIME headers and content into the email being sent, manipulating the email's appearance and content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **MIME Injection:** The core issue is the injection of arbitrary MIME headers and content. The application does not properly validate or sanitize the input provided, enabling an attacker to manipulate the email structure and content.

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is accessible without requiring any authentication, making it easier for attackers to exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** An attacker can send phishing emails with malicious content (e.g., links to fake login pages), potentially leading to credential theft, malware distribution, and other malicious activities.
*   **Email Spoofing:** The injected MIME headers can be used to spoof the sender's address or alter the email's appearance, further increasing the effectiveness of phishing attempts.
*   **Malware Distribution:** By injecting malicious HTML content, an attacker can redirect users to websites hosting malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/RestAPI/PasswordSelfServiceAPI` endpoint. The `ACTION_TO_PERFORM` parameter is manipulated to inject malicious MIME content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target ADSelfService Plus server to send HTTP POST requests.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge about sending HTTP POST requests and crafting MIME-formatted payloads.
*   **Target Email:** The attacker needs knowledge of valid usernames for the domain for which they are trying to send emails.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The provided Python script demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specific MIME-formatted payload and sending it to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   The script highlights how to include HTML content that appears to be a legitimate password reset email.
*   The vulnerability affects versions of ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus prior to 6112.

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-37420 allows an unauthenticated attacker to send arbitrary emails to domain users by exploiting a MIME injection vulnerability in the `/RestAPI/PasswordSelfServiceAPI` endpoint of ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus. This can result in phishing attacks, email spoofing, and malware distribution.
