Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-37662

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation within the `BoostedTreesCalculateBestGainsPerFeature` and `BoostedTreesCalculateBestFeatureSplitV2` operations in TensorFlow. Specifically, the `node_id_range` input was not properly checked, allowing an attacker to pass an empty tensor, leading to a reference binding to a null pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Input Validation:** The core issue is the absence of validation for the `node_id_range` tensor, which should have a specific shape and size (rank 1 tensor with shape=[2]).
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** When an empty tensor is passed for `node_id_range`, the code attempts to access its elements, resulting in a null pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Undefined Behavior:** The primary impact is undefined behavior, which could manifest as crashes, unexpected program termination, or other unpredictable behavior, potentially leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct API Calls:** Attackers can trigger the vulnerability by crafting specific inputs to the `tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCalculateBestGainsPerFeature` and `tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCalculateBestFeatureSplitV2` functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **API Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to call the vulnerable TensorFlow operations with controlled input data. This implies access to the TensorFlow API or a system that uses it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit `9c87c32c710d0b5b53dc6fd3bfde4046e1f7a5ad` and `429f009d2b2c09028647dd4bb7b3f6f414bbaad7` address the vulnerability by adding checks for the shape and size of the `node_id_range` tensor, preventing the null pointer dereference.

- The vulnerability is considered "Low" severity.
- The fix has been included in TensorFlow 2.6.0 and backported to 2.5.1, 2.4.3, and 2.3.4.
