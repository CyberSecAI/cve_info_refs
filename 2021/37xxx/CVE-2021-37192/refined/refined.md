- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected software has an information disclosure vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor. Specifically, the software allows an attacker to retrieve a list of network devices a known user can manage.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain knowledge of which network devices a known user can manage.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated attacker on the same network as the affected system can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in the same network as the affected system and needs to know a valid user to exploit this vulnerability.
