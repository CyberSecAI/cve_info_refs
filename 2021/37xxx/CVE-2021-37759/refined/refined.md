The provided content is related to CVE-2021-37759.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Session IDs were being leaked in Graylog's DEBUG log file and the audit log.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Session ID leak in DEBUG logs: Session IDs were printed in DEBUG level log messages.
*   Session ID leak in Audit Logs: Session IDs were printed in the Graylog Enterprise Audit Log.
*   Insufficient logging controls: DEBUG logs, although not enabled by default, can expose sensitive information if enabled. Also, the audit log, accessible by Graylog administrators, was leaking session IDs.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to the leaked session ID could take over a legitimate user's session. This would grant the attacker all the permissions and access associated with the compromised user.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to gain access to the DEBUG log file (if enabled) or the Graylog Enterprise Audit Log.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need access to either:
* The server's filesystem where the Graylog DEBUG log file is stored if DEBUG logging is enabled.
* The Graylog application with administrative access to view the audit logs.
