Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37673:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the `MapStage` operation within TensorFlow. Specifically, the code fails to validate if the `key` input tensor is non-empty before proceeding with further operations.

**Weakness:**
- Lack of input validation: The code does not check if the input `key` tensor is empty.

**Impact:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a `CHECK`-fail, leading to a denial of service. The `CHECK`-fail results in program termination.

**Attack Vector:**
- Maliciously crafted input: An attacker can construct a TensorFlow graph that includes a `tf.raw_ops.MapStage` operation with an empty `key` tensor.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input to a TensorFlow model that uses the `tf.raw_ops.MapStage` operation. This could be an external user providing data to a hosted model.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `tensorflow/core/kernels/map_stage_op.cc` at line 513.
- The code was missing a check for a non-empty `key` tensor before attempting to use the tensor.
- The fix was introduced in commit `d7de67733925de196ec8863a33445b73f9562d1d`, where a check `OP_REQUIRES(ctx, key_tensor->NumElements() > 0, errors::InvalidArgument("key must not be empty"));` was added to ensure the `key` tensor is not empty.

**Patched Versions:**
- The issue was patched in TensorFlow versions 2.3.4, 2.4.3, and 2.5.1. It is also included in version 2.6.0.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided code snippet demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability using an empty tensor for the `key` argument.
- The vulnerability is classified as moderate severity.
- This vulnerability was reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.
