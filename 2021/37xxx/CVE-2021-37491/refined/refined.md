Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37491:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Dogecoin Core wallet software prior to version 1.14.3 handles transaction inputs within the `CWallet::CreateTransaction()` function. Specifically, the wallet uses ordered inputs, meaning the order in which coins are selected for a transaction is predictable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Privacy Leakage:** The ordered nature of transaction inputs allows observers to potentially fingerprint the wallet, compromising user privacy. This predictability enables observers to potentially link multiple transactions to the same wallet or user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure**: Attackers can gain insights into the wallet's coin selection strategy, leading to potential privacy breaches by correlating transactions and identifying wallet software versions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable by passive network observers who can monitor blockchain transactions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a passive observer of the blockchain network to analyze the transaction data. No interaction with the vulnerable wallet is required. The attacker does not require any specific privileges or user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Dogecoin Core versions 1.14.3 and earlier.
- The fix involves shuffling the selected coins before transaction finalization which was implemented in Bitcoin and then backported to Dogecoin.
- The fix is present in the 1.21 development branch of Dogecoin, but has not been released in a stable version.
- There is a delay in releasing the fix for older versions because it changes the pattern of wallet transactions which could be used to identify specific vulnerable wallet versions.
