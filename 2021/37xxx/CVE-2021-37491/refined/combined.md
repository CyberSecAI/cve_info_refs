### **[yixiao5428](/yixiao5428)** commented [Jun 9, 2021](#issue-916163402)

| The wallet uses ordered inputs of transactions (`src/wallet/wallet.cpp`, [line 2628 - 2640](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L2628-L2640)), which may incur privacy risks like fingerprinting the wallet to observers.  A possible solution is to clear the original order, shuffle it, and push back the new order before signing the transaction.  Similar fix from Bitcoin: [bitcoin/bitcoin@2fb9c1e](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/2fb9c1e6681370478e24a19172ed6d78d95d50d3).  Reported by `6004ed5feaa31ae9df36b5dbc60f0fa53255a5fb734334082c6d202405fc738c`. |

| [@yixiao5428](https://github.com/yixiao5428) Should `setCoins` type be changed from a `set<pair<const CWalletTx*,unsigned int>>` to a `set<CInputCoin>` on [line 2466](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/e34197907f32f3fca371bfc490ef6e521723a070/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L2466)?  Hi [@p-j01](https://github.com/p-j01), It's not necessary. They are basically the same. You can check this commit [bitcoin/bitcoin@fd44ac1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/fd44ac1e8b75f6f83cc0fea20ae721de163ff9cc) from Bitcoin. |

| If this is closed then please close the issue.  I think the issue is valid and I haven't seen any real discussion on the [1.14 PR](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/2314). If the target is to implement this for 1.21 per my suggestion, then we'd keep the issue open until we have a 1.21 release, if people disagree with my position then we keep it open until we merge [#2314](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/2314). |

| I saw this issue link and it seems that [it is] not resolved?  It's not resolved for 1.14 yet, but it's solved in the 1.21 branch. Unfortunately, the 1.14 pull request on this repo where discussion took place goes to a 404 right now.  My rationale in that PR, about being careful which release to put the fix in was that we'd create a situation where a change in pattern of wallet transactions that right now is alleged to lead to on-chain identification of wallet software used, could, when changed on a minor release, then be used to identify specific wallet software versions, including the vulnerabilities of these. In an environment where software updates are slow to roll out and there is very little responsible disclosure happening - this issue and CVE being a prime example of the latter - this becomes risky when we patch this on a minor release, as opposed to on a major release where we can still do security fixes on previous major versions (and thus are able to prevent observation of vulnerabilities).  However, to my recollection no one challenged my thinking on the PR discussion, so this can probably use some discussion here. |

| None of the nodes running with the new patched version 1.21.x  That list isn't exhaustive, but yes, this is because it's not released, nor is it ready for release.  Do you have a planned date for the roll out of 1.21.x?  Rollout is not something that can be planned. It's up to each individual operator, as developers we can only release - uptake is outside of our control. 1.21 is still under development and the first release was planned for almost a year ago. We're running into significant delay; I think at this point it can safely be called stagnation.  If there is no better progress on a first 1.21 release, work could be directed towards an intermediate major release in which this issue among other important issues is being resolved. The more time passes, the more desirable this becomes. I've been open to doing it for a while but I have not seen any enthusiasm from others towards it, yet. |

| PS: I had to talk to GH Support to find out what happened to the related PR because there was nothing in the audit logs. Per support, the reason why [#2314](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/2314) is showing a 404 is because of a potential GitHub ToS violation by the author of that PR, and will stay hidden until that is resolved.  This is unfortunate - I will look into running [0xB10C/github-metadata-backup](https://github.com/0xB10C/github-metadata-backup) a bit more often (so far I have used it twice), so that we are able to at least retain important discussions. It would be great if others are willing to do this too - decentralization is awesome. |

## What is Dogecoin?

An open-source peer-to-peer digital currency, favoured by
Shiba Inus worldwide.

At its heart, Dogecoin is the accidental crypto movement that makes people smile! It is also an opensource peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that utilises blockchain technology, a highly secure decentralised system of storing information as a public ledger that is maintained by a network of computers called nodes. More than this, though, is the ethos of Dogecoin, summarised in the
[Dogecoin Manifesto](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/manifesto/)
, and its amazing, vibrant community made up of friendly folks just like you!

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
