Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   Lack of input validation in multiple fields within the Axon PBX software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, both stored and reflected XSS are possible.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Account compromise
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement of the application
    *   Potentially other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Stored XSS**: Injecting malicious scripts into various fields including:
    *   Extension name
    *   Line name
    *   Outbound dialing plan
    *   Blacklist IP
    *   SipRule
    *   Primary phone
    *   Customer name
*   **Reflected XSS**: Injecting malicious scripts through URL parameters:
    *   `/planprop?id=`
    *   `/extensionsinstruction?id=`
    *   `/ipblacklist?errorip=`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Axon PBX software.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the fields/URL parameters mentioned in the attack vectors.
