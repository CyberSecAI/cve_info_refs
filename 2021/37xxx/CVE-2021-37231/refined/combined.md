# AtomicParsley: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **202305-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in AtomicParsley, the worst of which could result in arbitrary code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/atomicparsley** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.6\_p20210715\_p151551** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.6\_p20210715\_p151551** |

| Package | **media-video/atomicparsley-wez** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.9.6** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

AtomicParsley is a command line program for manipulating iTunes-style metadata in MPEG4 files.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in AtomicParsley. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Please review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Workaround

Users can pass only trusted input to AtomicParsley.

### Resolution

Previously, the "wez" AtomicParsley fork was packaged in Gentoo as media-video/atomicparsley-wez. This fork is now packaged as media-video/atomicparsley, so users of the fork's package should now depclean it:

```
 # emerge --ask --depclean "media-video/atomicparsley-wez"

```

All AtomicParsley users should upgrade to the latest version, which is a packaging of the "wez" AtomicParsley fork:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/atomicparsley-0.9.6_p20210715_p151551"

```

### @tank0123 **[tank0123](/tank0123)** commented [Jul 11, 2021](#issue-941380433)

I checked the modified patch of [abbce70](https://github.com/wez/atomicparsley/commit/abbce70ecf54a8bbc6e84d3ad8ca5d98f9476e1d),

But a memory leak occurred, so I wrote a patch code.

Please check it.

I observed that the free function of uint32\_buffer for detail extraction did not exist.

I've added the corresponding free function.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I checked the code you wrote. However, there was still a memory leak, so I wrote a patch code.  Please check [#31 (comment)](https://github.com/wez/atomicparsley/pull/31#issue-687280335). |
