{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of data when forking a galaxy cluster. Specifically, when displaying metadata of the forked cluster, the values were not being properly sanitized before being included in the HTML, allowing for injection of malicious scripts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the galaxy cluster metadata, which will then be executed in the browser of users viewing the forked cluster. This allows the attacker to potentially steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other harmful actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could craft a malicious galaxy cluster with XSS payload within its metadata. Then when a user forks the cluster, the payload will be stored in the forked cluster and executed when the metadata is displayed. The exploitation vector requires forking the malicious cluster.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to create or modify galaxy clusters with malicious metadata, and convince users to fork such a cluster. There are no specific position requirements other than being a user who can interact with galaxy clusters."
