# Advisory Details

September 15th, 2021
## Siemens Simcenter Femap MODFEM File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-1073ZDI-CAN-14260

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-37176](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-37176) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 3.3, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Siemens |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Simcenter Femap |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Siemens Simcenter Femap. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of MODFEM files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Siemens has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

SUMMARY

Siemens Simcenter Femap is affected by a vulnerability that could be triggered when the application
reads modfem ﬁles. If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with the affected application, an attacker
could leverage this vulnerability to leak information in the context of the current process.

Siemens recommends to update to the latest version line of Simcenter Femap (2021.2), which is not
affected by this type of vulnerabilities. Siemens recommends to avoid opening of untrusted ﬁles from
unknown sources.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not open untrusted modfem ﬁles from unknown sources

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37176

The femap.exe application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing modfem ﬁles.
This could result in an out of bounds read past the end of an allocated buffer.

An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to leak information in the context of the current process.
(ZDI-CAN-14260)

• Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative for coordinated disclosure

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The latest version line V2021.2 of Simcenter Femap introduces a data integrity for all model data which
prevents from similar, yet unknown vulnerabilities of the same category. For compatibility reasons with
old model data, this cannot be backported to earlier version lines. Therefore, Siemens encourages to
update to this new version line.
