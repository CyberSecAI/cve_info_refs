  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the `XmpTextValue::read()` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing Exiv2 if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector is local, requiring the user to open a crafted image file with the vulnerable application."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted image file that triggers the out-of-bounds read. The user needs to be tricked into processing the crafted image with exiv2."

  "affected_software": {
    "name": "Exiv2",
    "versions": "<= 0.27.4"

     "versions": "0.27.5 RC1"
   },
  "additional_information": {
    "code_location": "value.cpp, line 699",
    "details": "The issue occurs when parsing XMP metadata. If the string is like 'type= x', then `type` will be empty, leading to an out-of-bounds access when trying to read data at that offset.",
    "fix_details":"The fix involves using `std::vector::at()` for safer indexing with bounds checking rather than `operator[]`."
