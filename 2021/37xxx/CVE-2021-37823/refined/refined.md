The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in OpenCart versions 3.0.3.7 and possibly earlier.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data during the backup/restore process in the OpenCart admin panel. Specifically, when restoring a database backup, the system doesn't adequately validate the contents of the imported file, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection, where the system executes unsanitized SQL queries based on attacker-controlled data.
- Lack of input validation: The system doesn't sanitize or validate the SQL commands within the database backup file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, customer data, and other confidential information.
- Data Modification: The attacker can modify data within the database, potentially leading to corruption or unauthorized access to the website's functionalities.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Through SQL injection, the attacker could potentially use features like `LOAD_FILE()` to read arbitrary files from the server.
- Complete compromise: Full control over the web application, since it was an authenticated attack via admin account.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must have obtained admin rights to the website backend.
- The attacker must navigate to System -> Maintenance -> Backup/Restore -> Restore.
- The attacker uploads a specially crafted SQL backup file, containing malicious SQL injection payloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated access to the OpenCart admin panel with sufficient privileges.
- Ability to upload files through the admin interface.
