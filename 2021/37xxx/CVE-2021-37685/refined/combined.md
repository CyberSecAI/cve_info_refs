```
The for loop that follows this check assumes that `axis` is between `0` and `input_dims.size`. If user supplied `axis` is negative, the if code before this check is supposed to bring it back to positive (similar to how in Python one can do `l[-3]` to mean `l[-3 + len(l)]`).

# Heap OOB in TFLite

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-c545-c4f9-rf6v
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow-lite
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

TFLite's [`expand_dims.cc`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/149562d49faa709ea80df1d99fc41d005b81082a/tensorflow/lite/kernels/expand_dims.cc#L36-L50) contains a vulnerability which allows reading one element outside of bounds of heap allocated data:

```
  if (axis < 0) {
    axis = input_dims.size + 1 + axis;
  }
  TF_LITE_ENSURE(context, axis <= input_dims.size);

  TfLiteIntArray* output_dims = TfLiteIntArrayCreate(input_dims.size + 1);
  for (int i = 0; i < output_dims->size; ++i) {
    if (i < axis) {
      output_dims->data[i] = input_dims.data[i];
    } else if (i == axis) {
      output_dims->data[i] = 1;
    } else {
      output_dims->data[i] = input_dims.data[i - 1];
    }
  }
```

If `axis` is a large negative value (e.g., `-100000`), then after the first `if` it would still be negative. The check following the `if` statement will pass and the `for` loop would read one element before the start of `input_dims.data` (when `i = 0`).

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [d94ffe08a65400f898241c0374e9edc6fa8ed257](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/d94ffe08a65400f898241c0374e9edc6fa8ed257).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang of Baidu Security.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-37685
