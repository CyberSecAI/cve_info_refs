Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `expand_dims.cc` file within the TensorFlow Lite library.
- The code calculates the new dimension index `axis` and uses it to copy data from input dimensions to output dimensions, but fails to properly handle large negative values for axis.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** If a large negative value is provided for the `axis` parameter of the `ExpandDims` operation, the code attempts to access data before the beginning of the `input_dims.data` array, leading to a heap out-of-bounds read.
- Specifically, the code first tries to normalize negative `axis` values but this normalization fails if the axis is a very large negative number.
- The subsequent loop then attempts to access `input_dims.data[i]` even when i=0, resulting in an out-of-bounds read due to negative value of `axis`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is a heap out-of-bounds read, which can lead to:
    - Information disclosure
    - Denial of service (crashes)
    - Potential for more severe exploits, depending on memory layout

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker-controlled negative value is provided as the `axis` argument to the `ExpandDims` operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the input data to a TensorFlow Lite model.
- They must be able to set the `axis` parameter for an `ExpandDims` operation.
-  The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position (local user)

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow Lite versions prior to 2.6.0.
- Patches have been released for versions 2.3.4, 2.4.3, and 2.5.1.
- The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2021-37685.
- The vulnerability was reported by Yakun Zhang of Baidu Security.
