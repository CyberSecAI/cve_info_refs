Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Planex MZK-DP150N wireless router contains a hidden web page (`syscmd.asp`) that allows execution of arbitrary OS commands as root. This page was likely intended for debugging purposes but was inadvertently left in the production firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hidden Administrative Functionality:** The presence of `syscmd.asp` is not advertised in the router's web UI.
- **OS Command Injection:** The `syscmd.asp` page allows users to directly enter and execute shell commands.
- **Default Credentials:** The device uses `admin:password` as the default login credentials for the web administration interface which is used to access the `syscmd.asp` page.
- **Missing Authentication/Authorization:** The `syscmd.asp` page lacks proper authentication/authorization checks, allowing any authenticated user to execute commands.
- **Telnet Daemon:** The device has a telnet daemon that can be enabled through the command execution vulnerability using `busybox telnetd`. The telnet daemon is also configured to use the same `admin:password` default credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands as root on the router, leading to full system compromise.
- **Network Manipulation:** The attacker could modify network settings, intercept traffic, or use the router as a pivot point to attack other devices on the network.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could disrupt the normal operation of the router, causing a denial of service for connected clients.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The primary attack vector is through the hidden `syscmd.asp` page in the web administration interface.
- **Telnet:** After exploiting the command injection vulnerability, an attacker can activate the telnet service and gain shell access through the telnet port

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router to access its web interface.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in to the web administration interface. The default credentials `admin:password` will work if they haven't been changed.
- **Knowledge of Hidden Page:** The attacker needs to be aware of the existence of the `syscmd.asp` page.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Samy Younsi of Necrum Security Labs.
- The vendor, Planex Communications, has released firmware version 1.44 to address the vulnerability.
- The JPCERT/CC vulnerability analysis assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 with an attack vector of adjacent network, low complexity, high privileges required, no user interaction, and high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability. They also noted that the initial settings of the product use a common default login account.
