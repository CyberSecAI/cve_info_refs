Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection present in PbootCMS V3.0.5.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsanitized user input in the `member` parameter within the URL allows for SQL injection.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection, using `sleep()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including the database name, and potentially other data depending on the structure and tables within the db.
-  The vulnerability can also cause SQL errors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a GET request to the `/login/` endpoint with a specifically crafted `member` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable PbootCMS instance.
- No authentication is explicitly required in the provided PoC.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker injects SQL code using the `member` parameter like `/?member')^if((ascii(substr((select(database())),1,1))>1),1,sleep(3))%23` .
- The `if` statement in the payload allows for a time-based check:
    - If the `ascii()` value of the first character of the database name is greater than 1, the query executes normally.
    - Otherwise, the `sleep(3)` function is called, resulting in a delay.
- The attacker can iteratively extract characters from database name by adjusting the `substr` and `ascii` values in the payload.
