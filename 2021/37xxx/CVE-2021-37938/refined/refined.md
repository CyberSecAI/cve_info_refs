- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Kibana on Windows operating systems was not validating user-supplied paths when loading .pbf files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user could arbitrarily traverse the Kibana host to load internal files ending in the .pbf extension, potentially leading to information disclosure or other unintended consequences.
- **Attack vectors**: By providing a specially crafted path to the Kibana server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A malicious user must be able to supply a path to Kibana. This requires some level of access/permissions.
