Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2021-37519.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap buffer overflow exists in the `authfile_load` function when reading the `--auth-file` due to insufficient buffer allocation. Specifically, the code allocates a buffer based on the file size but does not account for the possibility of a missing newline character at the end of the file. This could lead to an out-of-bounds write when the last entry is read and no newline character exists.
- The vulnerability can occur when reading the last entry of the auth file if the file does not end with a newline character (`\n`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow.
- Insufficient buffer size allocation in `authfile_load`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A heap buffer overflow can lead to memory corruption, potentially causing a crash, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution if exploited.
- In this case, a crash is observed during testing.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can provide a specially crafted `--auth-file` that does not end with a newline character, causing the `authfile_load` function to write past the allocated buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the `--auth-file` parameter to the memcached executable. This typically implies local access, but this might be achieved remotely in some setups.
