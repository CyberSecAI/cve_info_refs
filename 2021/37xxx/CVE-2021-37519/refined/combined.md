Fix minor severity heap buffer overflow reading `--auth-file`

```
Fixes [#805](https://github.com/memcached/memcached/issues/805)

Allocate an extra byte for reading the last entry when there is no `\n` at
the end of the file.

Also, check if the user contains null bytes when reading the last entry.

Unrelatedly, add handling in case the auth file size changes while it is being read.
```
