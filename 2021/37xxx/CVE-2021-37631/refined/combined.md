# Deck shared with a Circle can be accessed by non-Circle members

Moderate

[LukasReschke](/LukasReschke)
published
GHSA-4mxp-j277-82hr
Sep 6, 2021

## Package

Nextcloud Deck

## Affected versions

< 1.5.1, < 1.4.4, < 1.2.9

## Patched versions

1.5.1, 1.4.4, 1.2.9

## Description

### Impact

The Deck application didn't properly check membership of users in a Circle. This allowed other users in the instance to gain access to boards that have been shared with a Circle, even if the user was not a member of the circle.

### Patches

It is recommended that Nextcloud Deck is upgraded to 1.5.1, 1.4.4 or 1.2.9.

### Workarounds

Disable the "Deck" app.

Some improvements in reducing the amount of old Circles APIs being called and unifying their use through a service class.

Sorry, something went wrong.
