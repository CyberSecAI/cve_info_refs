Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37631:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Nextcloud Deck application failed to properly check user membership within a Circle before granting access to boards shared with that Circle.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is a lack of proper access control enforcement. The application did not verify if a user was a member of a specific Circle before allowing them to access boards shared with that Circle. This bypasses the intended access restrictions.
*   **Incorrect Privilege Management:** The application did not correctly manage privileges related to Circle memberships.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Users who were not members of a Circle could gain access to boards shared with that Circle.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This unauthorized access could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information contained within the boards.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker only needs network access to the Nextcloud instance.
*   **Authentication:**  The attacker needs a valid account within the Nextcloud instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a registered user within the Nextcloud instance.
*   The attacker does not need to be a member of the targeted circle.
*   The attacker can exploit the issue without any special privileges or access beyond a normal user account.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the Nextcloud Deck application.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves moving circle checks to a unified service and improving member checks.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as CWE-639, which is "Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key".
