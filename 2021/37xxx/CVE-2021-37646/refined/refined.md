Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37646:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams` operation within TensorFlow. Specifically, the issue stems from how the code handles the `ngram_widths` parameter. Negative values for `ngram_widths` are passed to `tstring`'s `reserve` method. This method then calls `TF_TString_Reserve` which takes an `unsigned long` for the buffer size, leading to an implicit conversion of the negative integer to a large positive value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is an integer overflow due to the conversion of a negative signed integer (`ngram_widths`) to an unsigned integer, causing the allocation of an extremely large memory chunk.
*   **Unvalidated Input:** The code did not properly validate the input `ngram_widths` parameter, allowing negative values to be used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** The oversized memory allocation resulting from the integer overflow can lead to a crash due to excessive memory usage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a call to `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams` with negative values for `ngram_widths`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to execute TensorFlow code and control the arguments passed to `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams`. This could be a user running malicious TensorFlow code or an attacker that can control parameters being passed to TensorFlow API.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves adding a check to ensure that all values in `ngram_widths` are positive before allocating any memory, as shown in the provided commit diff.
*   The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.6.0. Patches were also applied to versions 2.3.4, 2.4.3 and 2.5.1.
*   The vulnerability was reported by the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
