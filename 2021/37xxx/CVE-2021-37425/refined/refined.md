Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-37425:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The MobileTogether Server improperly processes user-supplied XML data, specifically failing to sanitize or disable XML external entity (XXE) references. This allows the server to resolve these entities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the server's susceptibility to XXE injection. It parses XML data provided by users and resolves external entities.
*   **XML Exponential Entity Expansion:** The server is also vulnerable to XML exponential entity expansion which can lead to denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** Attackers can read non-binary files from the server's file system. This is limited to files where the absolute path is known and files are non-binary (e.g., configuration files or source code).
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers can make the server perform HTTP requests to external or internal systems. This could expose internal services or be used to gain further access.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Through XML exponential entity expansion, an attacker can cause the server to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests with Malicious XML:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP requests containing malicious XML data within a JSON payload to the `/workflowmanagement` endpoint.
*   **Access to at Least One App:** The attacker must have access to at least one application hosted on the MobileTogether Server. This access can be gained through valid user credentials, default credentials, or potentially through anonymous access depending on the server configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access to MobileTogether Server:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the MobileTogether Server.
*   **Access to an App:** The attacker must have access to at least one application hosted on the MobileTogether Server (can be obtained via valid user account, default credentials or anonymous access).
*   **Knowledge of File Paths:** To read files, the attacker must have some knowledge of the absolute paths of the targeted files.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory provides a detailed proof-of-concept, including example HTTP requests, XML payloads and responses illustrating the file disclosure, SSRF and DoS vulnerabilities.
*   The advisory states that the MobileTogether Server configuration file path `C:\ProgramData\Altova\MobileTogetherServer\mobiletogetherserver.cfg` is a good target, as it stores the absolute path to the server's certificate and private key.
*   The vulnerability affects versions 7.0 to 7.3 and potentially earlier versions, and is fixed in version 7.3 SP1.
