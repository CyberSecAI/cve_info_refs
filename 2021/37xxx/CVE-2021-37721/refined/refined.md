- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, leading to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authenticated command injection vulnerability in the ArubaOS command line interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged user on the underlying operating system, leading to full compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks via the ArubaOS command line interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the ArubaOS command line interface with administrative privileges.
