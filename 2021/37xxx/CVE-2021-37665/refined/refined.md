The content is related to CVE-2021-37665.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Incomplete validation of input tensors in the MKL implementation of requantization operations within TensorFlow. Specifically, the `RequantizationRangePerChannel` and `MklRequantizePerChannelOp` operations did not properly validate the dimensions of input tensors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of dimension validation for the `input` tensor in `RequantizationRangePerChannel`
- Incomplete validation of input arguments in `MklRequantizePerChannelOp`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Undefined behavior such as binding a reference to a null pointer
- Out-of-bounds access to heap allocated arrays

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting specific input tensors with incorrect dimensions or empty input, an attacker could trigger the vulnerability through the `tf.raw_ops.RequantizationRangePerChannel` and `gen_math_ops.requantize_per_channel` operations in TensorFlow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to provide input to a TensorFlow model utilizing the vulnerable `RequantizationRangePerChannel` or `MklRequantizePerChannelOp` operations.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions before 2.6.0.
- The vulnerability was fixed in commits `9e62869465573cb2d9b5053f1fa02a81fce21d69` and `203214568f5bc237603dbab6e1fd389f1572f5c9`.
- Patched versions include 2.3.4, 2.4.3, and 2.5.1.
- The vulnerability was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
- The vulnerability is rated as moderate severity.
