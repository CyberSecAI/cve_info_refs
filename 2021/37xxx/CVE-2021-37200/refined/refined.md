**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, also known as a path traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'):** The webserver of the affected SINEC NMS system does not properly restrict pathnames in HTTP requests, allowing an attacker to navigate to directories outside of the intended web root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can download arbitrary files from the underlying filesystem of the server. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as configuration files, credentials, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the webserver of the affected SINEC NMS system.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the webserver.
- The attacker requires low privileges to exploit this vulnerability as indicated by the CVSS vector (PR:L).

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory also mentions CVE-2021-37201 which is a CSRF vulnerability.
- The advisory recommends updating to SINEC NMS V1.0 SP1 or later to remediate this vulnerability.
