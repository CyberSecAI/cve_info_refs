Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-37601

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper access control within the Multi-User Chat (MUC) component of Prosody. Specifically, the logic for accessing affiliation lists was flawed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allowed any user to access the list of entities (Jabber/XMPP addresses) affiliated with a Multi-User Chat room, including admins, members, owners, and banned users. This was possible even if the user was not a member of the chat, or if their affiliation would not normally allow them to view this list.
- **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper restrictions on who can access the affiliation lists within MUC.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy Violation:** Attackers could obtain a list of participants in a private group chat, compromising the privacy of those involved.
- **Targeted Attacks:** Knowledge of the addresses of room administrators and members could be used to launch further targeted attacks against individuals.
- **Compromise of Security Configuration:** The vulnerability was particularly concerning when combined with "members-only" room configurations which are commonly used with OMEMO end-to-end encryption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, with no requirement for the attacker to be on the same network as the vulnerable server.
- **Network Access:** Attackers would require network access to the vulnerable Prosody server.
- **XMPP/Jabber Protocol:** The vulnerability is exploited through standard XMPP/Jabber protocol requests related to Multi-User Chat functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic XMPP Client:** An attacker only needs a standard XMPP client.
- **Knowledge of Room Address:** The attacker needs to know the Jabber/XMPP address of the vulnerable chat room.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require any special privileges or authentication within the chat room.

**Additional Notes:**
- **Affected Versions:** All Prosody versions from 0.11.0 up to (but not including) 0.11.10 are affected.
- **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in Prosody 0.11.10.
- **Mitigation:** While upgrading to 0.11.10 is the recommended solution, a patch was also available for manual application to older installations.
- **Configuration Dependency:** The vulnerability was exposed when `whois` room configuration was set to `anyone`, which allowed sharing the real addresses of occupants with all other occupants (“non-anonymous”).
- **OMEMO Usage:** The impact of this vulnerability is particularly high for rooms that use the “members-only” feature with OMEMO end-to-end encryption, as this configuration is a prerequisite for using OMEMO.
