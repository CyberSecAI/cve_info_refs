Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37647:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a null pointer dereference within the `tf.raw_ops.SparseTensorSliceDataset` implementation in TensorFlow. The issue occurs when the input `indices` tensor is empty while the `values` tensor is not, or vice-versa.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of proper validation for empty sparse tensors. The code failed to check if both `indices` and `values` are empty when one of them is.
- A null pointer dereference occurs because the code accesses the size of the indices tensor using `indices->dim_size(0)` without checking if it's empty. When indices are empty, `indices` is backed by an empty `std::vector`, and calling `dim_size(0)` on an empty vector leads to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit leads to a denial-of-service vulnerability by crashing the TensorFlow process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing specific inputs to `tf.raw_ops.SparseTensorSliceDataset` where either the `indices` tensor is empty and the `values` tensor is not, or vice-versa.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide inputs to the `tf.raw_ops.SparseTensorSliceDataset` function. This could be achieved by crafting malicious input data that is processed by TensorFlow.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in commit [02cc160e29d20631de3859c6653184e3f876b9d7](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/02cc160e29d20631de3859c6653184e3f876b9d7), which introduced a check to ensure that both `indices` and `values` are either both empty or both non-empty.
- Patches were included in TensorFlow versions 2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1, and 2.6.0.
- A test case was added to check this specific condition in the `from_sparse_tensor_slices_test.py` file.
