# Null pointer dereference in `SparseTensorSliceDataset`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-c5x2-p679-95wc
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

When a user does not supply arguments that determine a valid sparse tensor, `tf.raw_ops.SparseTensorSliceDataset` implementation can be made to dereference a null pointer:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.raw_ops.SparseTensorSliceDataset(
  indices=[[],[],[]],
  values=[1,2,3],
  dense_shape=[3,3])
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/sparse_tensor_slice_dataset_op.cc#L240-L251) has some argument validation but fails to consider the case when either `indices` or `values` are provided for an empty sparse tensor when the other is not.

If `indices` is empty (as in the example above), then [code that performs validation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/sparse_tensor_slice_dataset_op.cc#L260-L261) (i.e., checking that the indices are monotonically increasing) results in a null pointer dereference:

```
    for (int64_t i = 0; i < indices->dim_size(0); ++i) {
      int64_t next_batch_index = indices->matrix<int64>()(i, 0);
      ...
    }
```

If `indices` as provided by the user is empty, then `indices` in the C++ code above is backed by an empty `std::vector`, hence calling `indices->dim_size(0)` results in null pointer dereferencing (same as calling `std::vector::at()` on an empty vector).

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [02cc160e29d20631de3859c6653184e3f876b9d7](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/02cc160e29d20631de3859c6653184e3f876b9d7).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

Prevent nullptr deref in SparseTensorSliceDataset

```
The arguments must determine a valid sparse tensor. This means that when indices are empty then the values must be empty too (and the reverse).

Also added test, by modifying existing test with empty sparse tensor to now run with an invalid sparse tensor input.
