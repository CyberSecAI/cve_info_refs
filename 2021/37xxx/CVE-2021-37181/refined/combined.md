SSA-453715: Deserialization Vulnerability in CCOM Communication
Component of Desigo CC Family

2021-09-14
Publication Date:
2021-09-14
Last Update:
Current Version:
V1.0
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 10.0

SUMMARY

Desigo CC, Desigo CC Compact and Cerberus DMS that use CCOM communication component hosted
in IIS contain a deserialisation vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to perform remote
code execution. Only those systems that use Windows App and/or IE XBAP Web Client are affected.
Regular installed clients and the new HTML5 Flex Clients are not impacted by this vulnerability.

Note that the risk of this vulnerability being exploited is particularly high for any Desigo CC system that
is connected directly to the Internet. For systems not accessible directly from the Internet, an attacker
would need to have access to the local network to exploit this vulnerability.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• If the user is using a software version equal or older than V3.x, no patches will be released. Siemens
recommends to upgrade to V5.0 QU1 (or any newer version that will be released in the future).

• If a patch or Quality Update is not feasible, and if the user can accept to stop the use of Windows
App and IE XBAP Web Client, then disable the Web Application and Web Client from SMC. As a
result, Windows App and IE XBAP Web Client will stop working and the vulnerability cannot be
exploited anymore.

• If all the above cannot apply, restrict Desigo CC to dedicated local networks, disabling the Internet
access by blocking the CCOM Port for inbound and outbound communication. This will allow the
use of Windows App and IE XBAP Client within a deﬁned network space like the local network only.
This action requires approval from the user as it will not remove the vulnerability but reduce the
exposure. The vulnerability can be exploited in case the attacker can access the protected network
ﬁrst.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Cerberus DMS is a danger management station that helps users manage ﬁre safety and security events.

Desigo CC is the integrated building management platform for managing high-performing buildings. With
its open design, it has been developed to create comfortable, safe and efﬁcient facilities. It is easily
scalable from simple single-discipline systems to fully integrated buildings.

Desigo CC Compact extends the portfolio with a tailored solution for small and medium-sized buildings.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for

weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37181

The application deserialises untrusted data without sufﬁcient validations, that could result in an
arbitrary deserialization. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute code in the affected
system. The CCOM communication component used for Windows App / Click-Once and IE Web /
XBAP client connectivity are affected by the vulnerability.
