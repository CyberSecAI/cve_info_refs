- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application deserializes untrusted data without sufficient validations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can achieve remote code execution on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The CCOM communication component used for Windows App / Click-Once and IE Web / XBAP client connectivity is vulnerable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability, especially if the system is directly connected to the Internet. For systems not directly accessible from the Internet, the attacker needs access to the local network.
