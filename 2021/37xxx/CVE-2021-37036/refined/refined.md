- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper storage of specific information in a log file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Leakage. The vulnerability is due to specific information being stored improperly in log files. This allows an attacker to access sensitive information during user logins.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to information leakage.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to gain access to the affected device. Once access is obtained, the attacker can retrieve information from the improperly stored log file during user logins.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have access to the affected device.
