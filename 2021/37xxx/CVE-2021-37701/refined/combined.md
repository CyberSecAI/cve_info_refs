Vulnerability CVE-2020-1971

The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those
name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which
compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function
behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer
dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses
the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names
between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certiﬁcate 2) When
verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via
the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control
both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can
trick a client or server into checking a malicious certiﬁcate against a malicious CRL then this may occur.
Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certiﬁcate.
This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certiﬁcate and CRL being veriﬁed. OpenSSL’s
s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the “-crl_download” option which implements
automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note
that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct
encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that
OpenSSL’s parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are
affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).

Node.js versions before 10.23.1, 12.20.1, 14.15.4, 15.5.1 are vulnerable to a use-after-free bug
in its TLS implementation. When writing to a TLS enabled socket, node::StreamBase::Write calls
node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with a freshly allocated WriteWrap object as ﬁrst argument. If the DoWrite
method does not return an error, this object is passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult
structure. This may be exploited to corrupt memory leading to a Denial of Service or potentially other
exploits.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-8625

BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are conﬁgured to use GSS-
TSIG features. In a conﬁguration which uses BIND’s default settings the vulnerable code path is
not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the tkey-
gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconﬁguration options. Although the default conﬁguration is not
vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well
as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers.
The most likely outcome of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash of the named
process. However, remote code execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND
9.5.0 -> 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 ->

An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message

it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a
NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only
vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default conﬁguration). OpenSSL
TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue.
Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3450

The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT ﬂag enables additional security checks of the certiﬁcates present
in a certiﬁcate chain.
It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to
disallow certiﬁcates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added
as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a
previous check to conﬁrm that certiﬁcates in the chain are valid CA certiﬁcates was overwritten. This
effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certiﬁcates must not be able to issue other certiﬁcates. If a
“purpose” has been conﬁgured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certiﬁcate is
a valid CA. All of the named “purpose” values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore,
where a purpose is set the certiﬁcate chain will still be rejected even when the strict ﬂag has been
used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certiﬁcate veriﬁcation routines, but it can
be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly
set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT veriﬁcation ﬂag and either not set a purpose for the certiﬁcate
veriﬁcation or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL
versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to
OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected

Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page
Generation (‘Cross-site Scripting’)

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3711

In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function
EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The ﬁrst time, on en-
try, the “out” parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the “outlen” parameter is populated with the buffer
size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufﬁciently sized
buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the “out”
parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of
the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the ﬁrst call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can
be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overﬂow when
EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A
malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause
attacker chosen data to overﬂow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of
other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application
to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).

normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL
(0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL’s own “d2i”
functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the
ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING
structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures
which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the “data” and “length” ﬁelds in the
ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous
OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING
byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been
directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where
that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application
without NUL terminating the “data” ﬁeld, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can
also occur during name constraints processing of certiﬁcates (for example if a certiﬁcate has been
directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and
the certiﬁcate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures).
It can also occur in the
X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor
can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of
the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing
a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such
as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).

proxy can trick libcurl to use the wrong session ticket resume for the host and thereby circumvent
the server TLS certiﬁcate check and make a MITM attack to be possible to perform unnoticed. Note
that such a malicious HTTPS proxy needs to provide a certiﬁcate that curl will accept for the MITMed
server for an attack to work - unless curl has been told to ignore the server certiﬁcate check.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22901

curl 7.75.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from a use-after-free vulnerability resulting in already freed memory
being used when a TLS 1.3 session ticket arrives over a connection. A malicious server can use
this in rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote code execution in the client. When
libcurl at run-time sets up support for TLS 1.3 session tickets on a connection using OpenSSL, it
stores pointers to the transfer in-memory object for later retrieval when a session ticket arrives. If
the connection is used by multiple transfers (like with a reused HTTP/1.1 connection or multiplexed
HTTP/2 connection) that ﬁrst transfer object might be freed before the new session is established on
that connection and then the function will access a memory buffer that might be freed. When using
that memory, libcurl might even call a function pointer in the object, making it possible for a remote
code execution if the server could somehow manage to get crafted memory content into the correct
place in memory.

settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly
setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential conﬁguration options. Although
the default conﬁguration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND
is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with
Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO
implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND
was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this ﬂaw can be used to trigger a buffer
over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this ﬂaw can
be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overﬂow and possibly also to achieve remote code
execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and
Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC
implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users,
we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it
had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable
ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO
implementation, we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.

directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the
directory being created and added to the node-tar directory cache. When a directory is present in the
directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where
node-tar checks for symlinks occur. By ﬁrst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory
with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially
allowing an untrusted tar ﬁle to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary
ﬁles into that location, thus allowing arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in
releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-32804

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.1, 5.0.6, 4.4.14, and 3.3.2 has a arbitrary File
Creation/Overwrite vulnerability due to insufﬁcient absolute path sanitization. node-tar aims to prevent
extraction of absolute ﬁle paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the preservePaths
ﬂag is not set to true. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute ﬁle paths
contained in a tar ﬁle. For example /home/user/.bashrc would turn into home/user/.bashrc. This
logic was insufﬁcient when ﬁle paths contained repeated path roots such as ////home/user/.bashrc.
node-tar would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute ﬁle path with
repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. ///home/user/.bashrc) would still resolve to an absolute
path, thus allowing arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2,
4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a
custom onentry method which sanitizes the entry.path or a filter method which removes entries
with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which
ﬁxes a similar bug in later versions of tar.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37701

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.16, 5.0.8, and 6.1.7 has an arbitrary ﬁle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any ﬁle
whose location would be modiﬁed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by
ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary
stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are
created. This logic was insufﬁcient when extracting tar ﬁles that contained both a directory and a
symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive
entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both
\ and / characters as path separators, however \ is a valid ﬁlename character on posix systems.
By ﬁrst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to
bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar ﬁle to symlink
into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary ﬁles into that location, thus allowing
arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive
ﬁlesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at FOO, followed by a symbolic link named foo, then
on case-insensitive ﬁle systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from
the ﬁlesystem, but not from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.
A subsequent ﬁle entry within the FOO directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic
link, thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases
4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches
for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version
of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37712

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary ﬁle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any ﬁle
whose location would be modiﬁed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by
ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary
stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are
created. This logic was insufﬁcient when extracting tar ﬁles that contained both a directory and a
symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on
Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same ﬁle system entities as their 8.3 “short
path” counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a directory with one form of the
path, followed by a symbolic link with a different string that resolves to the same ﬁle system entity,
followed by a ﬁle using the ﬁrst form. By ﬁrst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory
with a symlink that had a different apparent name that resolved to the same entry in the ﬁlesystem, it
was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted
tar ﬁle to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary ﬁles into that location,

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37713

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary ﬁle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any ﬁle
whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part,
accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that
contain .. path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This
logic was insufﬁcient on Windows systems when extracting tar ﬁles that contained a path that was not
an absolute path, but speciﬁed a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as C:some\path.
If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example D:\extraction\dir, then the result
of path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath) would resolve against the current working
directory on the C: drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a .. portion of the
path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as C:../foo, and was not properly sanitized
by the logic that checked for .. within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects
users of node-tar on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and
6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues.
If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar.
There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization
procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions
of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-39134

@npmcli/arborist, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the node_modules
folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency con-
tracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into the expected
folder. This is, in part, accomplished by resolving dependency speciﬁers deﬁned in package.json man-
ifests for dependencies with a speciﬁc name, and nesting folders to resolve conﬂicting dependencies.
When multiple dependencies differ only in the case of their name, Arborist’s internal data structure saw
them as separate items that could coexist within the same level in the node_modules hierarchy. How-
ever, on case-insensitive ﬁle systems (such as macOS and Windows), this is not the case. Combined
with a symlink dependency such as file:/some/path, this allowed an attacker to create a situation in
which arbitrary contents could be written to any location on the ﬁlesystem. For example, a package
pwn-a could deﬁne a dependency in their package.json ﬁle such as "foo": "file:/some/path". An-
other package, pwn-b could deﬁne a dependency such as FOO: "file:foo.tgz". On case-insensitive
ﬁle systems, if pwn-a was installed, and then pwn-b was installed afterwards, the contents of foo.tgz
would be written to /some/path, and any existing contents of /some/path would be removed. Anyone
using npm v7.20.6 or earlier on a case-insensitive ﬁlesystem is potentially affected. This is patched in
@npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-39135

@npmcli/arborist, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the node_modules
folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency
contracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into the
expected folder. This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project’s node_modules
folder. If the node_modules folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced
with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on
the ﬁle system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are ﬁltered out, so
another means of creating a node_modules symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A preinstall
script could replace node_modules with a symlink. (This is prevented by using --ignore-scripts.)
2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run npm install
--ignore-scripts in the root. This may be successful, because npm install --ignore-scripts is
typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe.
This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more
information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.

## Patched versions

4.4.16 || 5.0.8 || 6.1.7

## Description

### Impact

Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution

`node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.

This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\` is a valid filename character on posix systems.

By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.

Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but *not* from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created.

These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7.

The v3 branch of `node-tar` has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of `node-tar`. If this is not possible, a workaround is available below.

### Patches

4.4.16 || 5.0.8 || 6.1.7

### Workarounds

Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom filter method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.

```
const tar = require('tar')

tar.x({
  file: 'archive.tgz',
  filter: (file, entry) => {
    if (entry.type === 'SymbolicLink') {
      return false
    } else {
      return true
    }
  }
})
```

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.

### Fix

The problem is addressed in the following ways:

1. All paths are normalized to use `/` as a path separator, replacing `\` with `/` on Windows systems, and leaving `\` intact in the path on posix systems. This is performed in depth, at every level of the program where paths are consumed.
2. Directory cache pruning is performed case-insensitively. This *may* result in undue cache misses on case-sensitive file systems, but the performance impact is negligible.

#### Caveat

Note that this means that the `entry` objects exposed in various parts of tar's API will now always use `/` as a path separator, even on Windows systems. This is not expected to cause problems, as `/` is a valid path separator on Windows systems, but *may* result in issues if `entry.path` is compared against a path string coming from some other API such as `fs.realpath()` or `path.resolve()`.

Users are encouraged to always normalize paths using a well-tested method such as `path.resolve()` before comparing paths to one another.

Package        : node-tar
Version        : 4.4.6+ds1-3+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-37701 CVE-2021-37712
Debian Bug     : 993981

Cache poisoning vulnerabilities were found in node-tar, a Node.js module
used to read and write portable tar archives, which may result in
arbitrary file creation or overwrite.

CVE-2021-37701

    It was discovered that node-tar performed insufficient symlink
    protection, thereby making directory cache vulnerable to poisoning
    using symbolic links.

    Upon extracting an archive containing a directory 'foo/bar' followed
    with a symbolic link 'foo\\bar' to an arbitrary location, node-tar
    would extract arbitrary files into the symlink target, thus allowing
    arbitrary file creation and overwrite.

    Moreover, on case-insensitive filesystems, a similar issue occurred
    with a directory 'FOO' followed with a symbolic link 'foo'.

CVE-2021-37712

    Similar to CVE-2021-37701, a specially crafted tar archive
    containing two directories and a symlink with names containing
    unicode values that normalized to the same value, would bypass
    node-tar's symlink checks on directories, thus allowing arbitrary
    file creation and overwrite.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
4.4.6+ds1-3+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your node-tar packages.

For the detailed security status of node-tar please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/node-tar>

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 419 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2809080.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 38 new security patches for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  30 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update October 2021 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update October 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2796575.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2796575.1).

# node-tar

Fast and full-featured Tar for Node.js

The API is designed to mimic the behavior of `tar(1)` on unix systems.
If you are familiar with how tar works, most of this will hopefully be
straightforward for you. If not, then hopefully this module can teach
you useful unix skills that may come in handy someday :)

## Background

A "tar file" or "tarball" is an archive of file system entries
(directories, files, links, etc.) The name comes from "tape archive".
If you run `man tar` on almost any Unix command line, you'll learn
quite a bit about what it can do, and its history.

Tar has 5 main top-level commands:

* `c` Create an archive
* `r` Replace entries within an archive
* `u` Update entries within an archive (ie, replace if they're newer)
* `t` List out the contents of an archive
* `x` Extract an archive to disk

The other flags and options modify how this top level function works.

## High-Level API

These 5 functions are the high-level API. All of them have a
single-character name (for unix nerds familiar with `tar(1)`) as well
as a long name (for everyone else).

All the high-level functions take the following arguments, all three
of which are optional and may be omitted.

1. `options` - An optional object specifying various options
2. `paths` - An array of paths to add or extract
3. `callback` - Called when the command is completed, if async. (If
   sync or no file specified, providing a callback throws a
   `TypeError`.)

If the command is sync (ie, if `options.sync=true`), then the
callback is not allowed, since the action will be completed immediately.

If a `file` argument is specified, and the command is async, then a
`Promise` is returned. In this case, if async, a callback may be
provided which is called when the command is completed.

If a `file` option is not specified, then a stream is returned. For
`create`, this is a readable stream of the generated archive. For
`list` and `extract` this is a writable stream that an archive should
be written into. If a file is not specified, then a callback is not
allowed, because you're already getting a stream to work with.

`replace` and `update` only work on existing archives, and so require
a `file` argument.

Sync commands without a file argument return a stream that acts on its
input immediately in the same tick. For readable streams, this means
that all of the data is immediately available by calling
`stream.read()`. For writable streams, it will be acted upon as soon
as it is provided, but this can be at any time.

### Warnings and Errors

Tar emits warnings and errors for recoverable and unrecoverable situations,
respectively. In many cases, a warning only affects a single entry in an
archive, or is simply informing you that it's modifying an entry to comply
with the settings provided.

Unrecoverable warnings will always raise an error (ie, emit `'error'` on
streaming actions, throw for non-streaming sync actions, reject the
returned Promise for non-streaming async operations, or call a provided
callback with an `Error` as the first argument). Recoverable errors will
raise an error only if `strict: true` is set in the options.

Respond to (recoverable) warnings by listening to the `warn` event.
Handlers receive 3 arguments:

* `code` String. One of the error codes below. This may not match
  `data.code`, which preserves the original error code from fs and zlib.
* `message` String. More details about the error.
* `data` Metadata about the error. An `Error` object for errors raised by
  fs and zlib. All fields are attached to errors raisd by tar. Typically
  contains the following fields, as relevant:
  + `tarCode` The tar error code.
  + `code` Either the tar error code, or the error code set by the
    underlying system.
  + `file` The archive file being read or written.
  + `cwd` Working directory for creation and extraction operations.
  + `entry` The entry object (if it could be created) for `TAR_ENTRY_INFO`,
    `TAR_ENTRY_INVALID`, and `TAR_ENTRY_ERROR` warnings.
  + `header` The header object (if it could be created, and the entry could
    not be created) for `TAR_ENTRY_INFO` and `TAR_ENTRY_INVALID` warnings.
  + `recoverable` Boolean. If `false`, then the warning will emit an
    `error`, even in non-strict mode.

#### Error Codes

* `TAR_ENTRY_INFO` An informative error indicating that an entry is being
  modified, but otherwise processed normally. For example, removing `/` or
  `C:\` from absolute paths if `preservePaths` is not set.
* `TAR_ENTRY_INVALID` An indication that a given entry is not a valid tar
  archive entry, and will be skipped. This occurs when:

  + a checksum fails,
  + a `linkpath` is missing for a link type, or
  + a `linkpath` is provided for a non-link type.

  If every entry in a parsed archive raises an `TAR_ENTRY_INVALID` error,
  then the archive is presumed to be unrecoverably broken, and
  `TAR_BAD_ARCHIVE` will be raised.
* `TAR_ENTRY_ERROR` The entry appears to be a valid tar archive entry, but
  encountered an error which prevented it from being unpacked. This occurs
  when:

  + an unrecoverable fs error happens during unpacking,
  + an entry is trying to extract into an excessively deep
    location (by default, limited to 1024 subfolders),
  + an entry has `..` in the path and `preservePaths` is not set, or
  + an entry is extracting through a symbolic link, when `preservePaths` is
    not set.
* `TAR_ENTRY_UNSUPPORTED` An indication that a given entry is
  a valid archive entry, but of a type that is unsupported, and so will be
  skipped in archive creation or extracting.
* `TAR_ABORT` When parsing gzipped-encoded archives, the parser will
  abort the parse process raise a warning for any zlib errors encountered.
  Aborts are considered unrecoverable for both parsing and unpacking.
* `TAR_BAD_ARCHIVE` The archive file is totally hosed. This can happen for
  a number of reasons, and always occurs at the end of a parse or extract:

  + An entry body was truncated before seeing the full number of bytes.
  + The archive contained only invalid entries, indicating that it is
    likely not an archive, or at least, not an archive this library can
    parse.

  `TAR_BAD_ARCHIVE` is considered informative for parse operations, but
  unrecoverable for extraction. Note that, if encountered at the end of an
  extraction, tar WILL still have extracted as much it could from the
  archive, so there may be some garbage files to clean up.

Errors that occur deeper in the system (ie, either the filesystem or zlib)
will have their error codes left intact, and a `tarCode` matching one of
the above will be added to the warning metadata or the raised error object.

Errors generated by tar will have one of the above codes set as the
`error.code` field as well, but since errors originating in zlib or fs will
have their original codes, it's better to read `error.tarCode` if you wish
to see how tar is handling the issue.

### Examples

The API mimics the `tar(1)` command line functionality, with aliases
for more human-readable option and function names. The goal is that
if you know how to use `tar(1)` in Unix, then you know how to use
`import('tar')` in JavaScript.

To replicate `tar czf my-tarball.tgz files and folders`, you'd do:

```
import { create } from 'tar'
create(
  {
    gzip: <true|gzip options>,
    file: 'my-tarball.tgz'
  },
  ['some', 'files', 'and', 'folders']
).then(_ => { .. tarball has been created .. })
```

To replicate `tar cz files and folders > my-tarball.tgz`, you'd do:

```
// if you're familiar with the tar(1) cli flags, this can be nice
import * as tar from 'tar'
tar.c(
  {
    // 'z' is alias for 'gzip' option
    z: <true|gzip options>
  },
  ['some', 'files', 'and', 'folders']
).pipe(fs.createWriteStream('my-tarball.tgz'))
```

To replicate `tar xf my-tarball.tgz` you'd do:

```
tar.x( // or `tar.extract`
  {
    // or `file:`
    f: 'my-tarball.tgz'
  }
).then(_=> { .. tarball has been dumped in cwd .. })
```

To replicate `cat my-tarball.tgz | tar x -C some-dir --strip=1`:

```
fs.createReadStream('my-tarball.tgz').pipe(
  tar.x({
    strip: 1,
    C: 'some-dir', // alias for cwd:'some-dir', also ok
  }),
)
```

To replicate `tar tf my-tarball.tgz`, do this:

```
tar.t({
  file: 'my-tarball.tgz',
  onReadEntry: entry => { .. do whatever with it .. }
})
```

For example, to just get the list of filenames from an archive:

```
const getEntryFilenames = async tarballFilename => {
  const filenames = []
  await tar.t({
    file: tarballFilename,
    onReadEntry: entry => filenames.push(entry.path),
  })
  return filenames
}
```

To replicate `cat my-tarball.tgz | tar t` do:

```
fs.createReadStream('my-tarball.tgz')
  .pipe(tar.t())
  .on('entry', entry => { .. do whatever with it .. })
```

To do anything synchronous, add `sync: true` to the options. Note
that sync functions don't take a callback and don't return a promise.
When the function returns, it's already done. Sync methods without a
file argument return a sync stream, which flushes immediately. But,
of course, it still won't be done until you `.end()` it.

```
const getEntryFilenamesSync = tarballFilename => {
  const filenames = []
  tar.t({
    file: tarballFilename,
    onReadEntry: entry => filenames.push(entry.path),
    sync: true,
  })
  return filenames
}
```

To filter entries, add `filter: <function>` to the options.
Tar-creating methods call the filter with `filter(path, stat)`.
Tar-reading methods (including extraction) call the filter with
`filter(path, entry)`. The filter is called in the `this`-context of
the `Pack` or `Unpack` stream object.

The arguments list to `tar t` and `tar x` specify a list of filenames
to extract or list, so they're equivalent to a filter that tests if
the file is in the list.

For those who *aren't* fans of tar's single-character command names:

```
tar.c === tar.create
tar.r === tar.replace (appends to archive, file is required)
tar.u === tar.update (appends if newer, file is required)
tar.x === tar.extract

the low-level API that they are built on.

### tar.c(options, fileList, callback) [alias: tar.create]

Create a tarball archive.

The `fileList` is an array of paths to add to the tarball. Adding a
directory also adds its children recursively.

An entry in `fileList` that starts with an `@` symbol is a tar archive
whose entries will be added. To add a file that starts with `@`,
prepend it with `./`.

The following options are supported:

* `file` Write the tarball archive to the specified filename. If this
  is specified, then the callback will be fired when the file has been
  written, and a promise will be returned that resolves when the file
  is written. If a filename is not specified, then a Readable Stream
  will be returned which will emit the file data. [Alias: `f`]
* `sync` Act synchronously. If this is set, then any provided file
  will be fully written after the call to `tar.c`. If this is set,
  and a file is not provided, then the resulting stream will already
  have the data ready to `read` or `emit('data')` as soon as you
  request it.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `cwd` The current working directory for creating the archive.
  Defaults to `process.cwd()`. [Alias: `C`]
* `prefix` A path portion to prefix onto the entries in the archive.
* `gzip` Set to any truthy value to create a gzipped archive, or an
  object with settings for `zlib.Gzip()` [Alias: `z`]
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, stat)` for each
  entry being added. Return `true` to add the entry to the archive,
  or `false` to omit it.
* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths. [Alias: `P`]
* `mode` The mode to set on the created file archive
* `noDirRecurse` Do not recursively archive the contents of
  directories. [Alias: `n`]
* `follow` Set to true to pack the targets of symbolic links. Without
  this option, symbolic links are archived as such. [Alias: `L`, `h`]
* `noPax` Suppress pax extended headers. Note that this means that
  long paths and linkpaths will be truncated, and large or negative
  numeric values may be interpreted incorrectly.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.
  [Alias: `m`, `no-mtime`]
* `mtime` Set to a `Date` object to force a specific `mtime` for
  everything added to the archive. Overridden by `noMtime`.
* `onWriteEntry` Called with each `WriteEntry` or
  `WriteEntrySync` that is created in the course of writing the
  archive.

The following options are mostly internal, but can be modified in some
advanced use cases, such as re-using caches between runs.

* `linkCache` A Map object containing the device and inode value for
  any file whose nlink is > 1, to identify hard links.
* `statCache` A Map object that caches calls `lstat`.
* `readdirCache` A Map object that caches calls to `readdir`.
* `jobs` A number specifying how many concurrent jobs to run.
  Defaults to 4.
* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 16 MB.

### tar.x(options, fileList, callback) [alias: tar.extract]

Extract a tarball archive.

The `fileList` is an array of paths to extract from the tarball. If
no paths are provided, then all the entries are extracted.

If the archive is gzipped, then tar will detect this and unzip it.

Note that all directories that are created will be forced to be
writable, readable, and listable by their owner, to avoid cases where
a directory prevents extraction of child entries by virtue of its
mode.

Most extraction errors will cause a `warn` event to be emitted. If
the `cwd` is missing, or not a directory, then the extraction will
fail completely.

The following options are supported:

* `cwd` Extract files relative to the specified directory. Defaults
  to `process.cwd()`. If provided, this must exist and must be a
  directory. [Alias: `C`]
* `file` The archive file to extract. If not specified, then a
  Writable stream is returned where the archive data should be
  written. [Alias: `f`]
* `sync` Create files and directories synchronously.
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, entry)` for each
  entry being unpacked. Return `true` to unpack the entry from the
  archive, or `false` to skip it.
* `newer` Set to true to keep the existing file on disk if it's newer
  than the file in the archive. [Alias: `keep-newer`,
  `keep-newer-files`]
* `keep` Do not overwrite existing files. In particular, if a file
  appears more than once in an archive, later copies will not
  overwrite earlier copies. [Alias: `k`, `keep-existing`]
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths, paths containing `..`, and
  extracting through symbolic links. By default, `/` is stripped from
  absolute paths, `..` paths are not extracted, and any file whose
  location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted.
  [Alias: `P`]
* `unlink` Unlink files before creating them. Without this option,
  tar overwrites existing files, which preserves existing hardlinks.
  With this option, existing hardlinks will be broken, as will any
  symlink that would affect the location of an extracted file. [Alias:
  `U`]
* `strip` Remove the specified number of leading path elements.
  Pathnames with fewer elements will be silently skipped. Note that
  the pathname is edited after applying the filter, but before
  security checks. [Alias: `strip-components`, `stripComponents`]
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `preserveOwner` If true, tar will set the `uid` and `gid` of
  extracted entries to the `uid` and `gid` fields in the archive.
  This defaults to true when run as root, and false otherwise. If
  false, then files and directories will be set with the owner and
  group of the user running the process. This is similar to `-p` in
  `tar(1)`, but ACLs and other system-specific data is never unpacked
  in this implementation, and modes are set by default already.
  [Alias: `p`]
* `uid` Set to a number to force ownership of all extracted files and
  folders, and all implicitly created directories, to be owned by the
  specified user id, regardless of the `uid` field in the archive.
  Cannot be used along with `preserveOwner`. Requires also setting a
  `gid` option.
* `gid` Set to a number to force ownership of all extracted files and
  folders, and all implicitly created directories, to be owned by the
  specified group id, regardless of the `gid` field in the archive.
  Cannot be used along with `preserveOwner`. Requires also setting a
  `uid` option.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` value for extracted
  entries. [Alias: `m`, `no-mtime`]
* `transform` Provide a function that takes an `entry` object, and
  returns a stream, or any falsey value. If a stream is provided,
  then that stream's data will be written instead of the contents of
  the archive entry. If a falsey value is provided, then the entry is
  written to disk as normal. (To exclude items from extraction, use
  the `filter` option described above.)
* `onReadEntry` A function that gets called with `(entry)` for each entry
  that passes the filter.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `chmod` Set to true to call `fs.chmod()` to ensure that the
  extracted file matches the entry mode. This may necessitate a
  call to the deprecated and thread-unsafe `process.umask()`
  method to determine the default umask value, unless a
  `processUmask` options is also provided. Otherwise tar will
  extract with whatever mode is provided, and let the process
  `umask` apply normally.
* `processUmask` Set to an explicit numeric value to avoid
  calling `process.umask()` when `chmod: true` is set.
* `maxDepth` The maximum depth of subfolders to extract into. This
  defaults to 1024. Anything deeper than the limit will raise a
  warning and skip the entry. Set to `Infinity` to remove the
  limitation.

The following options are mostly internal, but can be modified in some
advanced use cases, such as re-using caches between runs.

* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 16 MB.
* `umask` Filter the modes of entries like `process.umask()`.
* `dmode` Default mode for directories
* `fmode` Default mode for files
* `dirCache` A Map object of which directories exist.
* `maxMetaEntrySize` The maximum size of meta entries that is
  supported. Defaults to 1 MB.

Note that using an asynchronous stream type with the `transform`
option will cause undefined behavior in sync extractions.
[MiniPass](http://npm.im/minipass)-based streams are designed for this
use case.

### tar.t(options, fileList, callback) [alias: tar.list]

List the contents of a tarball archive.

The `fileList` is an array of paths to list from the tarball. If
no paths are provided, then all the entries are listed.

If the archive is gzipped, then tar will detect this and unzip it.

If the `file` option is *not* provided, then returns an event emitter that
emits `entry` events with `tar.ReadEntry` objects. However, they don't
emit `'data'` or `'end'` events. (If you want to get actual readable
entries, use the `tar.Parse` class instead.)

If a `file` option *is* provided, then the return value will be a promise
that resolves when the file has been fully traversed in async mode, or
`undefined` if `sync: true` is set. Thus, you *must* specify an `onReadEntry`
method in order to do anything useful with the data it parses.

The following options are supported:

* `file` The archive file to list. If not specified, then a
  Writable stream is returned where the archive data should be
  written. [Alias: `f`]
* `sync` Read the specified file synchronously. (This has no effect
  when a file option isn't specified, because entries are emitted as
  fast as they are parsed from the stream anyway.)
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, entry)` for each
  entry being listed. Return `true` to emit the entry from the
  archive, or `false` to skip it.
* `onReadEntry` A function that gets called with `(entry)` for each entry
  that passes the filter. This is important for when `file` is set,
  because there is no other way to do anything useful with this method.
* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 16 MB.
* `noResume` By default, `entry` streams are resumed immediately after
  the call to `onReadEntry`. Set `noResume: true` to suppress this
  behavior. Note that by opting into this, the stream will never
  complete until the entry data is consumed.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")

### tar.u(options, fileList, callback) [alias: tar.update]

Add files to an archive if they are newer than the entry already in
the tarball archive.

The `fileList` is an array of paths to add to the tarball. Adding a
directory also adds its children recursively.

An entry in `fileList` that starts with an `@` symbol is a tar archive
whose entries will be added. To add a file that starts with `@`,
prepend it with `./`.

The following options are supported:

* `file` Required. Write the tarball archive to the specified
  filename. [Alias: `f`]
* `sync` Act synchronously. If this is set, then any provided file
  will be fully written after the call to `tar.c`.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `cwd` The current working directory for adding entries to the
  archive. Defaults to `process.cwd()`. [Alias: `C`]
* `prefix` A path portion to prefix onto the entries in the archive.
* `gzip` Set to any truthy value to create a gzipped archive, or an
  object with settings for `zlib.Gzip()` [Alias: `z`]
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, stat)` for each
  entry being added. Return `true` to add the entry to the archive,
  or `false` to omit it.
* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths. [Alias: `P`]
* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 16 MB.
* `noDirRecurse` Do not recursively archive the contents of
  directories. [Alias: `n`]
* `follow` Set to true to pack the targets of symbolic links. Without
  this option, symbolic links are archived as such. [Alias: `L`, `h`]
* `noPax` Suppress pax extended headers. Note that this means that
  long paths and linkpaths will be truncated, and large or negative
  numeric values may be interpreted incorrectly.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.
  [Alias: `m`, `no-mtime`]
* `mtime` Set to a `Date` object to force a specific `mtime` for
  everything added to the archive. Overridden by `noMtime`.
* `onWriteEntry` Called with each `WriteEntry` or
  `WriteEntrySync` that is created in the course of writing the
  archive.

### tar.r(options, fileList, callback) [alias: tar.replace]

Add files to an existing archive. Because later entries override
earlier entries, this effectively replaces any existing entries.

The `fileList` is an array of paths to add to the tarball. Adding a
directory also adds its children recursively.

An entry in `fileList` that starts with an `@` symbol is a tar archive
whose entries will be added. To add a file that starts with `@`,
prepend it with `./`.

The following options are supported:

* `file` Required. Write the tarball archive to the specified
  filename. [Alias: `f`]
* `sync` Act synchronously. If this is set, then any provided file
  will be fully written after the call to `tar.c`.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `cwd` The current working directory for adding entries to the
  archive. Defaults to `process.cwd()`. [Alias: `C`]
* `prefix` A path portion to prefix onto the entries in the archive.
* `gzip` Set to any truthy value to create a gzipped archive, or an
  object with settings for `zlib.Gzip()` [Alias: `z`]
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, stat)` for each
  entry being added. Return `true` to add the entry to the archive,
  or `false` to omit it.
* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths. [Alias: `P`]
* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 16 MB.
* `noDirRecurse` Do not recursively archive the contents of
  directories. [Alias: `n`]
* `follow` Set to true to pack the targets of symbolic links. Without
  this option, symbolic links are archived as such. [Alias: `L`, `h`]
* `noPax` Suppress pax extended headers. Note that this means that
  long paths and linkpaths will be truncated, and large or negative
  numeric values may be interpreted incorrectly.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.
  [Alias: `m`, `no-mtime`]
* `mtime` Set to a `Date` object to force a specific `mtime` for
  everything added to the archive. Overridden by `noMtime`.
* `onWriteEntry` Called with each `WriteEntry` or
  `WriteEntrySync` that is created in the course of writing the
  archive.

## Low-Level API

#### add(path)

Adds an entry to the archive. Returns the Pack stream.

#### write(path)

Adds an entry to the archive. Returns true if flushed.

#### end()

Finishes the archive.

### class PackSync

Synchronous version of `Pack`.

### class Unpack

A writable stream that unpacks a tar archive onto the file system.

All the normal writable stream stuff is supported. `write()` and
`end()` methods, `'drain'` events, etc.

Note that all directories that are created will be forced to be
writable, readable, and listable by their owner, to avoid cases where
a directory prevents extraction of child entries by virtue of its
mode.

`'close'` is emitted when it's done writing stuff to the file system.

Most unpack errors will cause a `warn` event to be emitted. If the
`cwd` is missing, or not a directory, then an error will be emitted.

#### constructor(options)

* `cwd` Extract files relative to the specified directory. Defaults
  to `process.cwd()`. If provided, this must exist and must be a
  directory.
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, entry)` for each
  entry being unpacked. Return `true` to unpack the entry from the
  archive, or `false` to skip it.
* `newer` Set to true to keep the existing file on disk if it's newer
  than the file in the archive.
* `keep` Do not overwrite existing files. In particular, if a file
  appears more than once in an archive, later copies will not
  overwrite earlier copies.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths, paths containing `..`, and
  extracting through symbolic links. By default, `/` is stripped from
  absolute paths, `..` paths are not extracted, and any file whose
  location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted.
* `unlink` Unlink files before creating them. Without this option,
  tar overwrites existing files, which preserves existing hardlinks.
  With this option, existing hardlinks will be broken, as will any
  symlink that would affect the location of an extracted file.
* `strip` Remove the specified number of leading path elements.
  Pathnames with fewer elements will be silently skipped. Note that
  the pathname is edited after applying the filter, but before
  security checks.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `umask` Filter the modes of entries like `process.umask()`.
* `dmode` Default mode for directories
* `fmode` Default mode for files
* `dirCache` A Map object of which directories exist.
* `maxMetaEntrySize` The maximum size of meta entries that is
  supported. Defaults to 1 MB.
* `preserveOwner` If true, tar will set the `uid` and `gid` of
  extracted entries to the `uid` and `gid` fields in the archive.
  This defaults to true when run as root, and false otherwise. If
  false, then files and directories will be set with the owner and
  group of the user running the process. This is similar to `-p` in
  `tar(1)`, but ACLs and other system-specific data is never unpacked
  in this implementation, and modes are set by default already.
* `win32` True if on a windows platform. Causes behavior where
  filenames containing `<|>?` chars are converted to
  windows-compatible values while being unpacked.
* `uid` Set to a number to force ownership of all extracted files and
  folders, and all implicitly created directories, to be owned by the
  specified user id, regardless of the `uid` field in the archive.
  Cannot be used along with `preserveOwner`. Requires also setting a
  `gid` option.
* `gid` Set to a number to force ownership of all extracted files and
  folders, and all implicitly created directories, to be owned by the
  specified group id, regardless of the `gid` field in the archive.
  Cannot be used along with `preserveOwner`. Requires also setting a
  `uid` option.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` value for extracted
  entries.
* `transform` Provide a function that takes an `entry` object, and
  returns a stream, or any falsey value. If a stream is provided,
  then that stream's data will be written instead of the contents of
  the archive entry. If a falsey value is provided, then the entry is
  written to disk as normal. (To exclude items from extraction, use
  the `filter` option described above.)
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `onReadEntry` A function that gets called with `(entry)` for each entry
  that passes the filter.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `chmod` Set to true to call `fs.chmod()` to ensure that the
  extracted file matches the entry mode. This may necessitate a
  call to the deprecated and thread-unsafe `process.umask()`
  method to determine the default umask value, unless a
  `processUmask` options is also provided. Otherwise tar will
  extract with whatever mode is provided, and let the process
  `umask` apply normally.
* `processUmask` Set to an explicit numeric value to avoid
  calling `process.umask()` when `chmod: true` is set.
* `maxDepth` The maximum depth of subfolders to extract into. This
  defaults to 1024. Anything deeper than the limit will raise a
  warning and skip the entry. Set to `Infinity` to remove the
  limitation.

### class UnpackSync

Synchronous version of `Unpack`.

Note that using an asynchronous stream type with the `transform`
option will cause undefined behavior in sync unpack streams.
[MiniPass](http://npm.im/minipass)-based streams are designed for this
use case.

### class tar.Parse

A writable stream that parses a tar archive stream. All the standard
writable stream stuff is supported.

If the archive is gzipped, then tar will detect this and unzip it.

Emits `'entry'` events with `tar.ReadEntry` objects, which are
themselves readable streams that you can pipe wherever.

Each `entry` will not emit until the one before it is flushed through,
so make sure to either consume the data (with `on('data', ...)` or
`.pipe(...)`) or throw it away with `.resume()` to keep the stream
flowing.

#### constructor(options)

Returns an event emitter that emits `entry` events with
`tar.ReadEntry` objects.

The following options are supported:

* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, entry)` for each
  entry being listed. Return `true` to emit the entry from the
  archive, or `false` to skip it.
* `onReadEntry` A function that gets called with `(entry)` for each entry
  that passes the filter.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")

#### abort(error)

Stop all parsing activities. This is called when there are zlib
errors. It also emits an unrecoverable warning with the error provided.

### class tar.ReadEntry extends [MiniPass](http://npm.im/minipass)

A representation of an entry that is being read out of a tar archive.

It has the following fields:

* `extended` The extended metadata object provided to the constructor.
* `globalExtended` The global extended metadata object provided to the
  constructor.
* `remain` The number of bytes remaining to be written into the
  stream.
* `blockRemain` The number of 512-byte blocks remaining to be written
  into the stream.
* `ignore` Whether this entry should be ignored.
* `meta` True if this represents metadata about the next entry, false
  if it represents a filesystem object.
* All the fields from the header, extended header, and global extended
  header are added to the ReadEntry object. So it has `path`, `type`,
  `size`, `mode`, and so on.

#### constructor(header, extended, globalExtended)

Create a new ReadEntry object with the specified header, extended
header, and global extended header values.

### class tar.WriteEntry extends [MiniPass](http://npm.im/minipass)

A representation of an entry that is being written from the file
system into a tar archive.

Emits data for the Header, and for the Pax Extended Header if one is
required, as well as any body data.

Creating a WriteEntry for a directory does not also create
WriteEntry objects for all of the directory contents.

It has the following fields:

* `path` The path field that will be written to the archive. By
  default, this is also the path from the cwd to the file system
  object.
* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `myuid` If supported, the uid of the user running the current
  process.
* `myuser` The `env.USER` string if set, or `''`. Set as the entry
  `uname` field if the file's `uid` matches `this.myuid`.
* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 1 MB.
* `linkCache` A Map object containing the device and inode value for
  any file whose nlink is > 1, to identify hard links.
* `statCache` A Map object that caches calls `lstat`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths.
* `cwd` The current working directory for creating the archive.
  Defaults to `process.cwd()`.
* `absolute` The absolute path to the entry on the filesystem. By
  default, this is `path.resolve(this.cwd, this.path)`, but it can be
  overridden explicitly.
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `win32` True if on a windows platform. Causes behavior where paths
  replace `\` with `/` and filenames containing the windows-compatible
  forms of `<|>?:` characters are converted to actual `<|>?:` characters
  in the archive.
* `noPax` Suppress pax extended headers. Note that this means that
  long paths and linkpaths will be truncated, and large or negative
  numeric values may be interpreted incorrectly.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.

#### constructor(path, options)

`path` is the path of the entry as it is written in the archive.

The following options are supported:

* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 1 MB.
* `linkCache` A Map object containing the device and inode value for
  any file whose nlink is > 1, to identify hard links.
* `statCache` A Map object that caches calls `lstat`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths.
* `cwd` The current working directory for creating the archive.
  Defaults to `process.cwd()`.
* `absolute` The absolute path to the entry on the filesystem. By
  default, this is `path.resolve(this.cwd, this.path)`, but it can be
  overridden explicitly.
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `win32` True if on a windows platform. Causes behavior where paths
  replace `\` with `/`.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.
* `umask` Set to restrict the modes on the entries in the archive,
  somewhat like how umask works on file creation. Defaults to
  `process.umask()` on unix systems, or `0o22` on Windows.

#### warn(message, data)

If strict, emit an error with the provided message.

Othewise, emit a `'warn'` event with the provided message and data.

### class tar.WriteEntry.Sync

Synchronous version of tar.WriteEntry

### class tar.WriteEntry.Tar

A version of tar.WriteEntry that gets its data from a tar.ReadEntry
instead of from the filesystem.

#### constructor(readEntry, options)

`readEntry` is the entry being read out of another archive.

The following options are supported:

* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths.
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.

### class tar.Header

A class for reading and writing header blocks.

It has the following fields:

* `nullBlock` True if decoding a block which is entirely composed of
  `0x00` null bytes. (Useful because tar files are terminated by
  at least 2 null blocks.)
* `cksumValid` True if the checksum in the header is valid, false
  otherwise.
* `needPax` True if the values, as encoded, will require a Pax
  extended header.
* `path` The path of the entry.
* `mode` The 4 lowest-order octal digits of the file mode. That is,
  read/write/execute permissions for world, group, and owner, and the
  setuid, setgid, and sticky bits.
* `uid` Numeric user id of the file owner
* `gid` Numeric group id of the file owner
* `size` Size of the file in bytes
* `mtime` Modified time of the file
* `cksum` The checksum of the header. This is generated by adding all
  the bytes of the header block, treating the checksum field itself as
  all ascii space characters (that is, `0x20`).
* `type` The human-readable name of the type of entry this represents,
  or the alphanumeric key if unknown.
* `typeKey` The alphanumeric key for the type of entry this header
  represents.
* `linkpath` The target of Link and SymbolicLink entries.
* `uname` Human-readable user name of the file owner
* `gname` Human-readable group name of the file owner
* `devmaj` The major portion of the device number. Always `0` for
  files, directories, and links.
* `devmin` The minor portion of the device number. Always `0` for
  files, directories, and links.
* `atime` File access time.
* `ctime` File change time.

#### constructor(data, [offset=0])

`data` is optional. It is either a Buffer that should be interpreted
as a tar Header starting at the specified offset and continuing for
512 bytes, or a data object of keys and values to set on the header
object, and eventually encode as a tar Header.

#### decode(block, offset)

Decode the provided buffer starting at the specified offset.

Buffer length must be greater than 512 bytes.

#### set(data)

Set the fields in the data object.

#### encode(buffer, offset)

Encode the header fields into the buffer at the specified offset.

Returns `this.needPax` to indicate whether a Pax Extended Header is
required to properly encode the specified data.

### class tar.Pax

An object representing a set of key-value pairs in an Pax extended
header entry.

It has the following fields. Where the same name is used, they have
the same semantics as the tar.Header field of the same name.

* `global` True if this represents a global extended header, or false
  if it is for a single entry.
* `atime`
* `charset`
* `comment`
* `ctime`
* `gid`
* `gname`
* `linkpath`
* `mtime`
* `path`
* `size`
* `uid`
* `uname`
* `dev`
* `ino`
* `nlink`

#### constructor(object, global)

Set the fields set in the object. `global` is a boolean that defaults
to false.

#### encode()

Return a Buffer containing the header and body for the Pax extended
header entry, or `null` if there is nothing to encode.

#### encodeBody()

Return a string representing the body of the pax extended header
entry.

#### encodeField(fieldName)

Return a string representing the key/value encoding for the specified
fieldName, or `''` if the field is unset.

### tar.Pax.parse(string, extended, global)

Return a new Pax object created by parsing the contents of the string
provided.

If the `extended` object is set, then also add the fields from that
object. (This is necessary because multiple metadata entries can
occur in sequence.)

### tar.types

A translation table for the `type` field in tar headers.

#### tar.types.name.get(code)

Get the human-readable name for a given alphanumeric code.

#### tar.types.code.get(name)

Get the alphanumeric code for a given human-readable name.
