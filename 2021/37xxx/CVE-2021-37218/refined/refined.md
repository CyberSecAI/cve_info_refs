Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control within Nomad's Raft RPC layer.
- Specifically, client agents, which should only have access to a subset of server RPC functionality, were able to access server-only Raft RPC functions due to a flaw in the authentication logic.
- This occurred because a non-server certificate from the configured Nomad CA could bypass the intended access restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** Client agents could elevate their privileges by accessing restricted server-side functionality.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The authentication logic failed to correctly differentiate between server and client agents, leading to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker leveraging this vulnerability could gain elevated privileges on the Nomad server.
- The specific impact of these elevated privileges is not explicitly detailed, but they would likely allow the attacker to perform administrative tasks and potentially compromise the entire Nomad cluster.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Direct communication with the server agent's Raft RPC layer using a non-server certificate from the configured Nomad CA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have access to a non-server certificate from the Nomad CA.
- The attacker must also have the ability to communicate directly with the server agent's Raft RPC layer, implying that they are running as a Nomad client agent.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was identified through internal testing by HashiCorp.
- The issue was addressed by modifying the RPC authentication logic to correctly enforce server-only access for the Raft RPC layer.
- The fix was released in Nomad versions 1.0.10 and 1.1.4.
