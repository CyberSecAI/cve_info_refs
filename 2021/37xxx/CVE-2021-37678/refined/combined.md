# Arbitrary code execution due to YAML deserialization

Critical

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-r6jx-9g48-2r5r
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

TensorFlow and Keras can be tricked to perform arbitrary code execution when deserializing a Keras model from YAML format.

```
from tensorflow.keras import models

payload = '''
!!python/object/new:type
args: ['z', !!python/tuple [], {'extend': !!python/name:exec }]
listitems: "__import__('os').system('cat /etc/passwd')"
'''

models.model_from_yaml(payload)
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/python/keras/saving/model_config.py#L66-L104) uses `yaml.unsafe_load` which can perform arbitrary code execution on the input.

### Patches

Given that YAML format support requires a significant amount of work, we have removed it for now.

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [23d6383eb6c14084a8fc3bdf164043b974818012](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/23d6383eb6c14084a8fc3bdf164043b974818012).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
