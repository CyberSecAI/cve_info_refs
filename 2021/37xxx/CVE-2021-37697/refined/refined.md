Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37697:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the Welcome cog in the Red-DiscordBot formats messages related to membership events. Specifically, the code used `format_str.format(member=user, server=guild, bot=user, count=count or "", plural=plural, roles=role_str)`, directly passing `discord.Member` and `discord.Guild` objects into the formatting string. This exposed sensitive attributes of those objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Exposure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information from Discord Member and Guild objects.  By directly passing these objects to the format string, an attacker could potentially access attributes such as IDs, creation dates, color codes, discriminator, and other data.
- **Unsafe Object Formatting**: The code was using string formatting on Discord objects without sanitizing or controlling what attributes could be accessed. This allows an attacker to potentially access almost any attribute available through the objects' properties.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Sensitive Information Leak:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information about members and guilds, which they may not normally have access to. This information could be used for malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted Membership Event Messages:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specific membership event message that leverages the vulnerable string formatting. This could be when a user joins or leaves a server, or other similar events that trigger the welcome message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **User Role/Permissions:** The attacker needs to be a user in the Discord server where the Welcome cog is active. They do not need to be a server administrator.
- **Understanding of Formatting Strings:** The attacker needs knowledge of python string formatting to craft messages that would expose the desired information.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Patch:** The commit `d63c49b4cfc30c795336e4fff08cba3795e0fcc0` addresses the vulnerability by introducing `SafeMember`, `SafeRole` and `SafeGuild` classes. These classes only expose specific safe attributes like name and id, while preventing access to sensitive object data.
- **Severity:** The vulnerability is classified as "High" due to the exposure of sensitive information.
- **No CWEs** The advisory indicates no specific Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) are associated with this vulnerability.
- **Credit:** The vulnerability was reported by user "Zephyrkul".
