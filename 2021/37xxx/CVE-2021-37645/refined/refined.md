Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37645:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad` implementation. Specifically, the `axis` value, which is a signed integer, is converted to an unsigned integer before being used as the size argument for an `absl::InlinedVector` constructor.  Negative values for the axis, when converted to unsigned integers, become very large positive numbers. This leads to the allocation of a very large vector.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Integer overflow:** Conversion of a signed integer to an unsigned integer without proper validation leading to unexpected large values.
- **Unbounded memory allocation:** Use of the converted large integer as the size of a vector, potentially leading to excessive memory allocation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The excessive memory allocation can lead to a crash due to out-of-memory errors.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing a negative value for the `axis` parameter to the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the value of the `axis` parameter passed to `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad`. This could be achieved by:
    - Directly crafting input to a TensorFlow model/graph that uses this op.
    - If the input to the model is generated via untrusted external source, an attacker might be able to pass malicious values for this argument.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc` file.
- The fix includes validation of the axis value, ensuring it is within the allowed range before being used for memory allocation.
- The vulnerability is considered moderate in severity.
- The vulnerability is fixed in TensorFlow versions 2.4.3, 2.5.1, and will be included in 2.6.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
