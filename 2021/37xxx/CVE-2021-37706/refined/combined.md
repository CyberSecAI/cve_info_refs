                 CVE-2022-23608 CVE-2022-24754 CVE-2022-24764

Multiple security issues were discovered in pjproject, is a free and
open source multimedia communication library.

CVE-2021-32686

    A race condition between callback and destroy, due to the accepted
    socket having no group lock. Second, the SSL socket
    parent/listener may get destroyed during handshake. s. They cause
    crash, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2021-37706

    An incoming STUN message contains an ERROR-CODE attribute, the
    header length is not checked before performing a subtraction
    operation, potentially resulting in an integer underflow scenario.
    This issue affects all users that use STUN. A malicious actor
    located within the victim‚Äôs network may forge and send a specially
    crafted UDP (STUN) message that could remotely execute arbitrary
    code on the victim‚Äôs machine

CVE-2021-41141

    In various parts of PJSIP, when error/failure occurs, it is found
    that the function returns without releasing the currently held
    locks. This could result in a system deadlock, which cause a
    denial of service for the users.

CVE-2021-43299

    Stack overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_player_create. An
    attacker-controlled 'filename' argument may cause a buffer
    overflow since it is copied to a fixed-size stack buffer without
    any size validation.

CVE-2021-43300

    Stack overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_recorder_create. An
    attacker-controlled 'filename' argument may cause a buffer
    overflow since it is copied to a fixed-size stack buffer without
    any size validation.

CVE-2021-43301

    Stack overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_playlist_create. An
    attacker-controlled 'file_names' argument may cause a buffer
    overflow since it is copied to a fixed-size stack buffer without
    any size validation.

CVE-2021-43302

    Read out-of-bounds in PJSUA API when calling
    pjsua_recorder_create. An attacker-controlled 'filename' argument
    may cause an out-of-bounds read when the filename is shorter than
    4 characters.

CVE-2021-43303

    Buffer overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_call_dump. An
    attacker-controlled 'buffer' argument may cause a buffer overflow,
    since supplying an output buffer smaller than 128 characters may
    overflow the output buffer, regardless of the 'maxlen' argument
    supplied

CVE-2021-43804

    An incoming RTCP BYE message contains a reason's length, this
    declared length is not checked against the actual received packet
    size, potentially resulting in an out-of-bound read access. A
    malicious actor can send a RTCP BYE message with an invalid reason
    length

CVE-2021-43845

    if incoming RTCP XR message contain block, the data field is not
    checked against the received packet size, potentially resulting in
    an out-of-bound read access

CVE-2022-21722

    it is possible that certain incoming RTP/RTCP packets can
    potentially cause out-of-bound read access. This issue affects
    all users that use PJMEDIA and accept incoming RTP/RTCP.

CVE-2022-21723

    Parsing an incoming SIP message that contains a malformed
    multipart can potentially cause out-of-bound read access. This
    issue affects all PJSIP users that accept SIP multipart.

CVE-2022-23608

    When in a dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key shared by
    multiple UAC dialogs can potentially be prematurely freed when one
    of the dialogs is destroyed . The issue may cause a dialog set to
    be registered in the hash table multiple times (with different
    hash keys) leading to undefined behavior such as dialog list
    collision which eventually leading to endless loop

CVE-2022-24754

    There is a stack-buffer overflow vulnerability which only impacts
    PJSIP users who accept hashed digest credentials (credentials with
    data_type `PJSIP_CRED_DATA_DIGEST`).

CVE-2022-24764

     A stack buffer overflow vulnerability that affects PJSUA2 users
     or users that call the API `pjmedia_sdp_print(),
     pjmedia_sdp_media_print()`

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.5.5~dfsg-6+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your pjproject packages.

               Asterisk Project Security Advisory - AST-2022-004

         Product        Asterisk
         Summary        pjproject: possible integer underflow on STUN
                        message
    Nature of Advisory  Arbitrary code execution
      Susceptibility    Remote unauthenticated sessions
         Severity       Major
      Exploits Known    Yes
       Reported On      March 3, 2022
       Reported By      Sauw Ming

         CVE Name       CVE-2021-37706

Debian Bug     : 1014998 1018073 1014976

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been found in Asterisk, an Open Source
Private Branch Exchange. Buffer overflows and other programming errors could be
exploited for information disclosure or the execution of arbitrary code.

Special care should be taken when upgrading to this new upstream release.
Some configuration files and options have changed in order to remedy
certain security vulnerabilities. Most notably the pjsip TLS listener only
accepts TLSv1.3 connections in the default configuration now. This can be
reverted by adding method=tlsv1_2 to the transport in pjsip.conf. See also
<https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-29017>.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.

For the detailed security status of asterisk please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/asterisk>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# Potential integer underflow upon receiving STUN message

High

[sauwming](/sauwming)
published
GHSA-2qpg-f6wf-w984
Dec 22, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

2.11.1 or lower

## Patched versions

2.12 or later

## Description

If the incoming STUN message contains an ERROR-CODE attribute, the header length is not checked before performing a subtraction operation, potentially resulting in an integer underflow scenario.

### Impact

It affects all users that use STUN. A malicious actor located within the victim‚Äôs network may forge and send a specially crafted UDP (STUN) message that could remotely execute arbitrary code on the victim‚Äôs machine.

### Patches

The patch is available as commit [15663e3](https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/15663e3f37091069b8c98a7fce680dc04bc8e865) in the master branch.

Debian Bug     : 1014998 1018073 1014976

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been found in Asterisk, an Open Source
Private Branch Exchange. Buffer overflows and other programming errors could be
exploited for information disclosure or the execution of arbitrary code.

Special care should be taken when upgrading to this new upstream release.
Some configuration files and options have changed in order to remedy
certain security vulnerabilities. Most notably the pjsip TLS listener only
accepts TLSv1.3 connections in the default configuration now. This can be
reverted by adding method=tlsv1_2 to the transport in pjsip.conf. See also
<https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-29017>.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.

For the detailed security status of asterisk please refer to
its security tracker page at:
