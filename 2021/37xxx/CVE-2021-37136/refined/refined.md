Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37136:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content from `github.com_4de30969_20250114_212005.html` directly relates to CVE-2021-37136, as stated in the title: *"Bzip2Decoder doesn't allow setting size restrictions for decompressed data".* This matches the description from the official NVD entry for CVE-2021-37136: *"The Bzip2 decompression decoder function doesn't allow setting size restrictions on the decompressed output data."*
*   The content from `www.oracle.com_cd95aeb5_20250114_212027.html` also contains information about CVE-2021-37136 in the context of the Oracle Critical Patch Update for January 2022 and mentions that it is addressed in "Oracle Commerce Guided Search" (among other products).
*   The content from `www.oracle.com_2ed21adf_20250114_212032.html` includes the reference to the patch including the fix of CVE-2021-37136 in Oracle products released in April 2022.
*   The other content is unrelated to CVE-2021-37136.

**2. Extraction of Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `Bzip2Decoder` in Apache Netty does not enforce size restrictions on the decompressed data.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** A lack of size limit on the decompressed output data.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to an out-of-memory error (OOME) causing a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. Malicious input designed to cause excessive memory consumption during decompression can bring down the affected service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Malicious input designed to cause excessive memory consumption during decompression.
    *   This is via the `Bzip2Decoder` component, when it is used by an application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send data that triggers the `Bzip2Decoder` component.

**3. Additional Details from www.oracle.com**

*   **Affected Products**:
    *   Multiple Oracle products are affected including: Oracle Commerce Guided Search, Oracle Database products, Oracle Communications Applications, Oracle Financial Services Applications, Oracle E-Business Suite, Oracle Enterprise Manager, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle Health Sciences Applications, Oracle Hospitality Applications, Oracle Hyperion, Oracle iLearning, Oracle Insurance Applications, Oracle Java SE, Oracle JD Edwards, Oracle MySQL, Oracle PeopleSoft, Oracle Policy Automation, Oracle Retail Applications, Oracle Siebel CRM, Oracle Supply Chain, Oracle Support Tools, Oracle Systems, Oracle Utilities Applications, Oracle VM VirtualBox. The document provides more details on the affected versions of each product family
*   **Mitigation:** Applying Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible is strongly recommended. Workarounds (such as blocking specific network protocols) are not recommended as long-term solutions.
*   **Patch Availability:** The specific patches addressing CVE-2021-37136 are located within the links provided for each affected product family.

**4. Additional Details from github.com**

*   The advisory on GitHub includes references to the code areas affected by this issue in the Netty project.
*   The advisory explicitly mentions that there is no workaround other than not using the Bzip2Decoder.

**Summary:**

The core of the vulnerability lies in the `Bzip2Decoder` not being able to control the size of decompressed output, making it susceptible to denial-of-service attacks when fed maliciously crafted compressed data. NetApp and Oracle have released security advisories and updates addressing this vulnerability in their products that use the vulnerable Netty component.  The advisory also notes the patch as fixing CVE-2021-37137, another Netty related security issue. The `github.com` content specifically describes it as an out-of-memory issue due to the size of the decompressed data.
