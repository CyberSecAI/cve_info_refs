Privacy and ConsentRequires the computer user's full knowledge and consent [Notification](fsrvsetup.exe "Click to get FlexiServer Attendance Software")  FlexiStation should be set up by the computer user. The Getting Started email clearly details the information that will be monitored when FlexiStation is run. Each time FlexiStation runs, a popup notification will display notifying the user that FlexiStation is running. In addition, there is always an icon shown in the taskbar when it is running. These monitoring disclosures cannot be hidden.  Use Private Mode to turn monitoring off at any time. Private Mode hours will not be counted towards work time in the user’s time sheet.  How It Works The manager or bookkeeper runs **FlexiServer** on their computer. Whenever the manager or bookkeeper wants to view reports they can log onto FlexiServer with their web browser and use the control panel.  All staff then run **FlexiStation** on their computers. FlexiStation runs in the background logging hours worked. Workstations will monitor hours even if the FlexiServer computer is offline, all the cached data will be sent to FlexiServer when it comes back online. FlexiStation provides employees a subset of features so they can manually enter hours, view individual reports or request time-off. |  |
