- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Authenticated command injection vulnerabilities exist in the ArubaOS command line interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation results in the ability to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged user on the underlying operating system. This allows an attacker to fully compromise the underlying operating system on the device running ArubaOS.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the ArubaOS command line interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the ArubaOS command line interface.
