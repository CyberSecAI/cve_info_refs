Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37686:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a logic error in the strided slice implementation within TensorFlow Lite (TFLite). Specifically, the issue arises from the newly introduced support for ellipsis in axis definitions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  An infinite loop can be triggered due to a flaw in the loop control logic when handling ellipsis in the strided slice operation. The inner loop's index `i` might not increment under certain conditions, and the outer loop also won't increment, causing an infinite loop.
- The vulnerability occurs due to a faulty calculation of `ellipsis_end_idx` which can lead to the inner loop not incrementing its counter `i`. The outer loop's counter is then skipped via continue statement.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by triggering an infinite loop in a TFLite model. This could lead to the application becoming unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a maliciously crafted TFLite model that is designed to trigger the faulty logic in the strided slice operation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a TFLite model to a system that uses the vulnerable code. This could be achieved through various means such as:
    - Training a model using specific parameters.
    - Modifying an existing model.
    - Providing a malicious model as input to an application or service that uses TensorFlow Lite.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow version 2.6.0.
- The fix is included in commit `dfa22b348b70bb89d6d6ec0ff53973bacb4f4695` and will be present in the patched version of TensorFlow 2.6.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
