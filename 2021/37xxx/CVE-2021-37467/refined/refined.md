- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
- The attacker needs the ability to input data into the vulnerable fields or parameters.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Quorum version 2.03 and earlier.
- Basic script tags are filtered, but can be bypassed with slightly more diverse payloads.
- This is a remote vulnerability, meaning it can be exploited over a network connection.
