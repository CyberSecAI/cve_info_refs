### Description

Due to a lack of proper overall input validation, an authenticated user can inject JavaScript Cross Site Scripting payloads into fields in Quorum to create stored or reflected XSS conditions. It was observed that some basic script tags were filtered however this is easily bypassed with a slightly more diverse payload.

### Vulnerability type

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

### Vendor

NCH Software

### Affected versions

Quorum 2.03 and earlier

### Attack type

Remote

### Authenticated

Yes

### Attack vectors

```
User Display Name (stored)
Conference Description (stored)
/uploaddoc?id= (reflected)
/conference?id= (reflected)
/conferencebrowseuploadfile?confid= (reflected)

```

| | Quorum Telephone Conference ServerPhone Conferencing Software for Business**This is a legacy program we no longer support.** Security Notice: The person you setup as admin on this program can have access to files on your system.  Quorum is software which runs as a phone conference server on any Windows PC. Callers dial into the server to join telephone conferences. Callers can connect to a conference call using either standard or VoIP lines on external telephone numbers or through an office phone system. The number of people who can join a conference call is limited only by your bandwidth. When the caller selects the option to create a new conference Quorum will assign and read back the unique and secure conference number. The conference creator then gives this number to each conference participant. Whenever any person dials the server and enters this conference number, they will join in the current conversation with the other members of the conference. | [Download Quorum Telephone Conference Server](qsetup.exe) | [Download Quorum Telephone Conference Server for Windows](qsetup.exe) | | --- | --- |   You can download Quorum and try it on any Windows PC. The bundled "Call Simulator" or a free VoIP service can be used for testing. You don't need to purchase to download and it only takes a couple of minutes to complete the process ([click here to install](qsetup.exe)). After you have tested the system and found it to be suitable, you can purchase a software license ([click here to purchase](https://secure.nch.com.au/cgi-bin/register.exe?software=quorum)). | [Download Quorum](qsetup.exe) [Download Now](qsetup.exe "Click to get Quorum Telephone Conference Software")[Purchase Quorum](https://secure.nch.com.au/cgi-bin/register.exe?software=quorum) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | [Click here for a guide to how the Quorum Telephone Conferencing Server works](screenshots.html) [See How Quorum Call Conferencing Works](howitworks.html) | Features * Create and manage call conferences* Easy to use web interface* Virtual conference room display via a web browser* Ability to upload documents for attendees to view* Runs on almost any Windows PC* Handles unlimited simultaneous conferences.The number of calls and conferences is limited only by your bandwidth* Connect via VoIP using the international standard SIP protocol.* Connect to ordinary phone lines (or analog PBX extensions) using [telephony devices](../hardware/telephony.html)* Easily allocate new conference IDs over the phone* Join pre-defined conferences with the allocated conference number* Voice prompts are easily changed via the user interface* VoIP calls can be made using [VoIP SIP Providers](../talk/sip.html) saving call costs* Installs and ready to run conferences in just minutes* Very simple user interface for day-to-day easy business use | | --- | --- |  System Requirements  * Windows 7/8/8.1/10/11* Works on **64 bit** Windows* See [Win 98](https://www.nch.com.au/software/win98/index.html), [Win 2000](https://www.nch.com.au/software/win2000/index.html) and [Win XP/Vista](https://www.nchsoftware.com/software/winxp/index.html) to download software compatible with earlier versions of Windows.  To connect to phone line(s) you need one of the following:  * A telephone number with a [SIP based VoIP service provider](../talk/sip.html).* A VoIP based office telephone system (try the [Axon PC PABX](../pbx/index.html)).* To connect to ordinary lines a [professional telephony board](../hardware/index.html).

We also have a number of other phone related applications that will work in conjunction with Quorum. See our [Telephone Software Guide](../phone/index.html) for a complete list. In particular we recommend the [Axon VoIP Based PBX](../pbx/index.html) to route calls to Quorum, and the [Express Talk VoIP Based Softphone](../talk/index.html) for free VoIP connections to Quorum via the Internet. For a more informal conference option for 2 or 3 people, try the conference feature on the [Express Talk softphone](../talk/index.html). | Call Conferencing [Features](#101) [System Requirements](#102) [Download Now](qsetup.exe) [How Quorum Works](howitworks.html) [Screenshots](screenshots.html) [Connection Options](../ivm/modems.html)  [- Telephony Boards](../hardware/telephony.html)  [- VoIP Services](../talk/sip.html) [Questions (FAQs)](faq.html) [Technical Support](support.html) [Pricing and Purchase](https://secure.nch.com.au/cgi-bin/register.exe?software=quorum) Related Software [Virtual PC PBX](../pbx/index.html) [Call Attendant](https://www.nch.com.au/ivm/index.html) [Call Recording](../software/callrec.html) [Voice Mail](https://www.nch.com.au/ivm/index.html) [On-Hold Player](../ims/index.html) [SIP Softphone](../talk/index.html) [Dictate by Phone](../dialdictate/index.html) [More phone software](../phone/index.html) Related Hardware [Telephony Boards](../hardware/telephony.html) [IP Phones](../hardware/ipphones.html) [FXO Adapters](../hardware/fxo.html) [Headsets](../hardware/headsets.html) |
