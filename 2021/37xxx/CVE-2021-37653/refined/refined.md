Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a division by zero error within the `ResourceGather` operation in TensorFlow. Specifically, when calculating the `batch_size` for indexing, the code does not check if `batch_size` is zero before using it as a divisor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Division by Zero:** The code calculates `batch_size` by multiplying the dimension sizes and then divides by it. If any dimension has size 0, `batch_size` becomes 0, leading to a division by zero.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a crash due to a floating-point exception. The provided code snippet demonstrates how an attacker could trigger this crash, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is triggered by crafting a specific input tensor with a shape that results in a `batch_size` of zero, specifically providing a tensor with a dimension of size zero to `tf.raw_ops.ResourceGather`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `tf.raw_ops.ResourceGather` operation. This could involve an attacker controlling some input data used within a TensorFlow model, where the model executes this operation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is in the `tensorflow/core/kernels/resource_variable_ops.cc` file.
- The fix adds a check to ensure `batch_size` is not zero before proceeding with the division.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2021-37653.
- The fix is included in TensorFlow versions 2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1 and 2.6.0
- The vulnerability was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
