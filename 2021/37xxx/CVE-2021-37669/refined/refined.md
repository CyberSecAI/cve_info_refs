Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37669:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow due to an implicit conversion of a user-controlled integer to an unsigned size when resizing a `std::vector`. Specifically, the `max_output_size` parameter, which is an integer, is used to resize a `std::vector`, however `std::vector::resize` takes a `size_t` (unsigned) parameter causing the integer to be implicitly converted. When a negative value is provided, the conversion to an unsigned type results in a very large value, leading to excessive memory allocation or other unexpected behavior.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** Implicit conversion from a signed integer (`int`) to an unsigned integer (`size_t`) when resizing a vector.
*   **Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:** The converted large value leads to an attempt to allocate very large amounts of memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a crash or excessive memory usage, leading to denial of service.
*   The application serving models using `tf.raw_ops.NonMaxSuppressionV5` and  `CombinedNonMaxSuppression` can crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker provides a negative integer value for the `max_output_size` parameter of the `tf.raw_ops.NonMaxSuppressionV5` operation or `max_output_size_per_class` in `CombinedNonMaxSuppression`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input parameters of the vulnerable TensorFlow operations, `tf.raw_ops.NonMaxSuppressionV5` or `CombinedNonMaxSuppression`.
*   This could be an external attacker interacting with a vulnerable TensorFlow model deployment, or an internal user of the library.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `NonMaxSuppressionV5` and `CombinedNonMaxSuppression` operations.
*   Patches were implemented to prevent the implicit conversion and instead check for non-negative output size to avoid the integer overflow.
*   The issue is addressed in TensorFlow versions 2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1 and will be included in 2.6.0.
* The provided code snippets illustrate how to trigger the vulnerability and highlight the location in the source code.
