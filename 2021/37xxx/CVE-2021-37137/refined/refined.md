{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2021-37137",
    "description": "The Snappy frame decoder function doesn't restrict the chunk length which may lead to excessive memory usage. Beside this it also may buffer reserved skippable chunks until the whole chunk was received which may lead to excessive memory usage as well.",
    "root_cause": "The Snappy frame decoder function in Netty lacks proper chunk length restriction and buffering of skippable chunks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Excessive memory allocation"
    ],
    "impact": "A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack due to excessive memory consumption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network stream",
      "Malicious file input"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply input to the `SnappyFrameDecoder` either via a network stream or a file.",
    "additional_information": "This vulnerability can be triggered by supplying malicious input that decompresses to a very big size or by sending a huge skippable chunk. Users of `SnappyFrameDecoder` are affected. "
