- Root cause of vulnerability: Use after free in Network APIs
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use after free
- Impact of exploitation: Could result in the execution of arbitrary code, denial of service or information disclosure.
- Attack vectors: Network APIs
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker would need to be able to trigger the use-after-free condition in the Network APIs.
