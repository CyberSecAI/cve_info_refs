Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37703:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Discourse publishes unread topic notifications to clients. When a new post is made, the server publishes a message to all clients who are tracking the topic. This message includes the user's read state for the topic, such as the last read post number and the notification level. The issue was that this information was being broadcast to all users who had access to a topic even when the user was not supposed to have it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of a user's read state to unauthorized clients. This is a type of information disclosure vulnerability.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The application lacked proper checks to ensure that only authorized users received the read state information for a topic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality breach:** An attacker could potentially monitor user activity by observing the exposed read state information. Specifically, they could identify when users read specific posts, their notification preferences, and their last read post in a topic. This information could be used to infer user behavior and activity within the forum.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable via the network since the information is being leaked through the message bus.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be a user of the Discourse forum and have network access to receive messages on the message bus.
*   **No Special Privileges:**  The attacker does not need any special privileges, they just need to have access to a topic.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required to trigger the publication of messages with the user's read state.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is patched in Discourse versions: stable <= 2.7.8; beta <= 2.8.0.beta5; tests-passed <= 2.8.0.beta5
*   The provided commit `aed65ec16d38886d7be7209d8c02df4ffd4937a4` fixes the vulnerability by ensuring that the unread message is sent only to the intended user, rather than broadcasting to all users who are tracking the topic
*   The CVSS score assigned is 4.3/10 which reflects a moderate severity.

In summary, this CVE describes an information disclosure vulnerability in Discourse where user read states for topics were being unintentionally exposed to unauthorized users due to insufficient access control when publishing topic updates.
