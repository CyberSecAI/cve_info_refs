- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Authenticated path traversal vulnerabilities exist in the ArubaOS command line interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal').
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in the ability to impact the integrity of critical files on the underlying operating system. This allows an attacker to impact the availability of the ArubaOS instance and may allow for modification of sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack via the ArubaOS command line interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires an authenticated user with access to the ArubaOS command line interface.
