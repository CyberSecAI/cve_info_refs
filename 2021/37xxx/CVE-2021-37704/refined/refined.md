      "related": true,
      "information": "The vulnerability is due to the presence of a `phpinfo.php` file within the `/docs/examples` directory of the `phpfastcache` library. If the `/vendor` directory containing this file is not protected from public access, it can be exploited to reveal sensitive server information. \n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is the inclusion of a `phpinfo.php` file in the library's documentation examples, which is accessible if the `/vendor` directory isn't properly secured.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability exposes the output of the PHP `phpinfo()` function, which can contain sensitive configuration details, server paths, PHP extensions, and environment variables. This includes potentially sensitive information, such as HTTPOnly cookies.\n*   **Lack of Default Security:** The library itself does not enforce protection of the `/vendor` directory, relying on the server configuration to prevent public access.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n*   **Information Leakage:** An attacker can obtain sensitive information about the server environment and PHP configuration, potentially including HttpOnly cookies and other sensitive data. This information could be used for further attacks, such as identifying other vulnerabilities.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is through network access to the vulnerable `phpinfo.php` file. Specifically by accessing the file via a web browser, typically by directly navigating to a URL like `http://example.com/vendor/phpfastcache/phpfastcache/docs/examples/phpinfo.php`.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   **Network access to the web server:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the server hosting the application and must be able to request files from the server's `/vendor` directory.\n*   **Knowledge of path:** The attacker needs to know or guess the path to the vulnerable file within the vendor directory.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n*   The vulnerability was reported in the context of the flextype CMS, where the `/vendor` directory was accessible.\n*   The fix for this vulnerability involves removing the vulnerable `phpinfo.php` file from the library, as well as ensuring that the vendor directory is not publicly accessible.\n*   Patched versions include 8.0.7, 7.1.2, and 6.1.5.\n*   Older versions (e.g., v5, v4) are not patched.\n*   The issue is considered to have a moderate severity with a CVSS score of 5.4"
