Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing validation in the implementation of sparse reduction operations within TensorFlow. Specifically, the code fails to check if reduction groups cause an overflow or if the generated index is within the bounds of the output tensor during sparse reduction operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap out-of-bounds write:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write to a heap-allocated buffer. This occurs because the calculated index (`idx`) used to write the reduced value can be outside the allocated memory range.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** Writing outside of the bounds of the allocated memory can corrupt other heap data structures and potentially overwrite other data. This can ultimately lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker is able to carefully manipulate the allocated memory and overwrite return addresses, etc.
- **Denial of Service:** The out-of-bounds write could also cause the program to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered using a crafted `tf.SparseTensor` with specific `indices`, `values`, and `dense_shape` parameters passed to `tf.sparse.reduce_sum` operation, and possibly other sparse reduction operations. This input triggers an out-of-bounds write when the grouped values are reduced and written to the output.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to supply crafted input to a TensorFlow model that uses vulnerable sparse reduction operations. This implies that the attacker would need to control either the data used for inference or the model definition.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves adding a check that verifies if the calculated index `idx` is within bounds of the output tensor before writing the reduced value:
```c++
    OP_REQUIRES(ctx,
                idx >= 0 && idx < out_flat.size(),
                errors::Internal(
                    "Obtained a write index of ", idx,
                    " which is outside of bounds of [0, ",
                    out_flat.size(), ")"));
    out_flat(idx) = reduced_val();
```
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.6.0. Patches have been backported to 2.3.4, 2.4.3, and 2.5.1.
- The issue was reported by the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
