# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@e4t](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8416824?v=4&size=48)[e4t](https://github.com/e4t)opened [on Feb 11, 2023](https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/issues/2458#issue-1581015113)

**Describe the bug**

[CVE-2021-37501](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37501) ([GHSA-rfgw-5vq3-wrjf](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rfgw-5vq3-wrjf "GHSA-rfgw-5vq3-wrjf")) describes a buffer overflow in h5dump, a [reproducer](https://github.com/ST4RF4LL/Something_Found/blob/main/HDF5_v1.13.0_h5dump_heap_overflow.assets/poc) and [description](https://github.com/ST4RF4LL/Something_Found/blob/main/HDF5_v1.13.0_h5dump_heap_overflow.md) for this can be found in

<https://github.com/ST4RF4LL/Something_Found>.

The root cause is an artificially large size of a dimension in a dataspace message which causes the size of the on-disk data to exceed the addressable range and thus causes a multiplication to overflow.

In `src/H5Oattr.c:H5O__attr_decode()` with `ds_size` being set to 4611686018427387904 (0x4000000000000000) and `dt_size` equal to 8, the multiplication in:

```
H5_CHECKED_ASSIGN(attr->shared->data_size, size_t, ds_size * (hsize_t)dt_size, hsize_t);

```

overflows and is truncated to 0.

Since there is no provision to detect the overflow, the size is underestimated which will finally lead to a heap buffer overflow when the data is read with a subsequent segfault.

**Expected behavior**

The size overflow should be detected and the respective decode function should report an error so that the caller will terminate gracefully.

**Platform**

* at least HDF5 1.10.8 and later (including current 'develop' branch)
* openSUSE Leap 15.4/ SLE 15 SP4 / openSUSE Tumbleweed
* gcc7
* Autotools
* `configure --enable-fortran --enable-unsupported --enable-hl --enable-shared --enable-threadsafe --enable-build-mode=production --enable-cxx --with-pthread`

This repository contains a high-performance library's source code and a file format
specification that implements the HDF5® data model. The model has been adopted across
many industries, and this implementation has become a de facto data management standard
in science, engineering, and research communities worldwide.

The HDF Group is the developer, maintainer, and steward of HDF5 software. Find more
information about The HDF Group, the HDF5 Community, and other HDF5 software projects,

## RELEASE SCHEDULE

[![HDF5 release schedule](/HDFGroup/hdf5/raw/develop/doc/img/release-schedule.png)](/HDFGroup/hdf5/blob/develop/doc/img/release-schedule.png)

HDF5 does not release on a regular schedule. Instead, releases are driven by
new features and bug fixes, though we try to have at least one release of each
maintenance branch per year. Future HDF5 releases indicated on this schedule
are tentative.

| Release | New Features |
| --- | --- |
| 2.0.0 | Drop Autotools support, drop the HDF5 <--> GIF tools, add complex number support, update library defaults (cache sizes, etc.), use semantic versioning |
| FUTURE | Multi-threaded HDF5, crashproofing / metadata journaling, Full (VFD) SWMR, encryption, digital signatures, sparse datasets, improved storage for variable-length datatypes, better Unicode support (especially on Windows) |

NOTE: In the March 2025 release we will begin using semantic versioning (<https://semver.org/>) and the previously announced 1.16.0 version will instead be numbered 2.0.0.

[A list of planned HDF5 2.0 features and bugfixes can be found here.](https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/wiki/HDF5-2.0-Planning)

This list of feature release versions is also tentative, and the specific release
in which a feature is introduced may change.
