**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the CTparental admin panel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSRF (CWE-352): The application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks because it does not implement proper token verification or other CSRF defenses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- This effectively disables the parental control functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is network-based (AV:N).
- It requires low attack complexity (AC:L).
- No special privileges are needed (PR:N)
- The attack requires user interaction (UI:R) because the administrator needs to be tricked into clicking a link

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to entice an administrator to click on a link that submits a crafted request to the vulnerable CTparental application. This could be done via social engineering or other means.
- No specific network position or privileges within the application are required.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable product version is CTparental before 4.45.03.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 4.45.03.
- The CVSS score is 8.8, indicating a High severity.
