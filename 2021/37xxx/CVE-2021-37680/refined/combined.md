# Division by zero in TFLite

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-cfpj-3q4c-jhvr
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow-lite
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

The implementation of fully connected layers in TFLite is [vulnerable to a division by zero error](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/lite/kernels/fully_connected.cc#L226):

```
const int batch_size = input_size / filter->dims->data[1];
```

An attacker can craft a model such that `filter->dims->data[1]` is 0.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [718721986aa137691ee23f03638867151f74935f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/718721986aa137691ee23f03638867151f74935f).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360. Concurrently, it has also been reported by Yakun Zhang of Baidu Security.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-37680

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
