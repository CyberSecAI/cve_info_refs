The provided content details multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Navigate CMS, version 2.9.4 r1561.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerabilities stem from a lack of proper input sanitization and parameterization in SQL queries. Several functionalities within the CMS use user-supplied input directly in SQL queries without prior validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The following SQL injection vulnerabilities were identified:

1.  **`block_order` injection**: In `blocks.php`, the `block_order` parameter is used to reorder blocks. This parameter is passed unsanitized to the `block::reorder` function in `block.class.php`, where it is used to construct a SQL query.
2.  **`id` injection in `items.php`**: The `id` parameter in `items.php`, when used to change comment status, is directly included in a SQL query within the `change_comment_status` case without sanitization.
3.  **`products_order` injection:** The `products_order` parameter in `products.php`, used to reorder products, is passed unsanitized to the `product::reorder` function in `product.class.php`, where it is used to construct a SQL query.
4.  **`id` injection in `products.php`**: Similar to the `items.php` vulnerability, the `id` parameter is used unsanitized in SQL queries to change comment status.
5.  **`template-properties-order` injection:** In `templates.php`, the `template-properties-order` parameter is used to reorder template properties and is passed unsanitized to `property::reorder` in `property.class.php`, where it's used in a SQL query.
6.  **`children_order` injection:** In `structure.php`, the `children_order` parameter, when reordering structure elements, is directly included in a SQL query via `structure::reorder` in `structure.class.php` without sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to perform arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database. This could lead to:

*   Data breaches: Accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data.
*   Website defacement: Modifying content or injecting malicious code.
*   Privilege escalation: Potentially gaining access to administrative functions.
*   Complete compromise of the application and database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST requests**:  The `block_order` and `products_order` injections are triggered through POST requests to the corresponding `navigate.php` endpoint. The vulnerable parameters are included in the request body as form data.
*   **HTTP GET requests**:  The `id` parameters in both `items.php` and `products.php`, as well as the `children_order` in `structure.php`, are vulnerable through GET requests, with the malicious SQL payloads injected in the URL.
*   The `template-properties-order` injection is triggered via a POST request similar to the block\_order injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
*   No specific authentication is required to exploit the vulnerabilities, however, the attacker would need some understanding of the application's interface and parameters.
*   The attacker would need to identify the vulnerable parameters and craft malicious SQL payloads to inject.

The provided information also includes screenshots of the crafted SQL injections and the resulting database queries, validating the vulnerabilities. It confirms that the attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands by manipulating the identified parameters. A fix was provided via commit `ed3f70b`.
