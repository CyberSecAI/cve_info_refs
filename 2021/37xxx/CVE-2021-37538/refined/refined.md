Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is the improper handling of user-supplied `day`, `month`, and `year` parameters in the `controllers/front/archive.php` file of the SmartBlog Prestashop module. These parameters are passed unsanitized to the `getArchiveResult()` function.
- Although the `getArchiveResult()` function uses `pSQL()` to escape the values, this is insufficient because the values are used within a query without surrounding quotes. Thus, a malicious user can inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. User-controlled input is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization for the context it is used in.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially leading to:
    - **Data Breach:** Accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data stored in the database.
    - **Privilege Escalation:**  Potentially gaining higher access within the database.
    - **Denial of Service:**  Causing the database to become unresponsive.
- **Information Disclosure:**  Revealing database structure or other sensitive information. In the example provided, the attacker is able to dump the names of all modules installed in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `/module/smartblog/archive` endpoint. The attacker manipulates the `day`, `month`, and `year` parameters in the URL. For example: `https://site.com/module/smartblog/archive?month=1&year=1&day=1 UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,(SELECT group_concat(name) FROM ps_module),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL-- -`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- No special privileges are required.
- The attacker does not need any authentication.

**Additional Details:**

- The blog post provides a clear example of how the vulnerability can be exploited, including a sample SQL injection payload and explanation.
- It also highlights a second SQL injection vulnerability in the category functionality, though it is not explored in as much depth.
- The post includes a timeline of the vulnerability discovery and remediation.
- It notes that casting to integers or proper quoting is recommended when using user-supplied values in SQL queries.
- The vendor provided a patch, and the vulnerability was assigned CVE-2021-37538.
- The vulnerable code is within the `SmartBlogPost::getArchiveResult()` function of the SmartBlog Prestashop module.
