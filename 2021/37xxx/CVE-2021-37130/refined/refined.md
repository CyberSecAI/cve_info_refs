- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The software uses external input to construct a pathname, but it does not properly validate the pathname, allowing path traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can access locations outside of the restricted directory by crafting a malicious filename.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker crafts a malicious filename within a message to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the affected device and craft a specific filename. They also require high privileges.
