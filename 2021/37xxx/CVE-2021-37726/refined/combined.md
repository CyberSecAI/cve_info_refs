WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Block access to the Aruba Instant Command Line Interface from all untrusted users
• Block access to the Aruba Instant web-based management interface from all untrusted users
• Enabling the Enhanced PAPI Security feature where available will prevent exploitation of these

vulnerabilities. Please contact TAC for assistance if needed

• Block access for Aruba Instant device on port UDP/8211 from all untrusted users

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE W1750D is an Access Point that supports IEEE 802.11ac standards for high-performance
WLAN, and is equipped with two dual-band radios, which can provide access and monitor the network
simultaneously.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37726

A remote buffer overﬂow vulnerability was discovered in HPE Aruba Instant (IAP). Successful exploita-
tion could allow for unauthenticated remote code execution, potentially resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code as a privileged user on the underlying system.
