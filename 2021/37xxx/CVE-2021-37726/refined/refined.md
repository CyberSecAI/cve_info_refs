- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A remote buffer overflow vulnerability exists in HPE Aruba Instant (IAP).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow for unauthenticated remote code execution, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code as a privileged user on the underlying system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, unauthenticated access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker without any authentication can trigger the vulnerability.
