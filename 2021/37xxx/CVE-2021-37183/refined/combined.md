SUMMARY

Multiple vulnerabilities in SINEMA Remote Connect Server could allow an unauthorized remote attacker
to retrieve or manipulate sensitive information from the affected software. In addition, the attacker could
also cause a Denial-of-Service condition in devices controlled by the affected software.

Siemens has released an update for the SINEMA Remote Connect Server and recommends to update to
the latest version.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINEMA Remote Connect is a management platform for remote networks that enables the simple
management of tunnel connections (VPN) between headquarters, service technicians, and installed
machines or plants. It provides both the Remote Connect Server, which is the server application, and the
Remote Connect Client, which is an OpenVPN client for optimal connection to SINEMA Remote Connect
Server.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s

environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37177

The status provided by the syslog clients managed by the affected software can be manipulated by an
unauthenticated attacker in the same network of the affected system.
