- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected software allows sending send-to-sleep notifications to the managed devices without proper access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Access Control (CWE-284) allows unauthenticated attackers to send sleep notifications.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition in the managed devices.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker on the same network as the affected system can send unauthorized sleep notifications.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the affected SINEMA Remote Connect Server. No authentication is needed.
