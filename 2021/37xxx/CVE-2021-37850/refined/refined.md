- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the ability of a user to send multiple restart commands from a modified ESET GUI, which can stop the ESET daemon.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The ESET software lacked proper verification measures, allowing a malicious user to repeatedly send restart commands that could stop the ESET daemon.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in the disabling of the ESET security product's protection features until the system is rebooted, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local and involves a user logged on to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user logged on to the system with an affected ESET product installed and they require the ability to send restart commands from a modified ESET GUI.
