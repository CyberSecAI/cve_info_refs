- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Sending specially crafted packets over port 102/tcp can lead to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing release of memory after effective lifetime (CWE-401).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition, requiring a device restart to restore normal operation.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, sending specifically crafted packets to the target device over TCP port 102.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can be located anywhere on the network as long as they can reach the target device over port 102/tcp.
