Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37916:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the insufficient sanitization of HTML input within the Joplin note body. Specifically, the application did not properly filter out potentially malicious HTML tags such as `form` and `button`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper neutralization of input during web page generation (CWE-79).
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The application allowed the use of form elements in the note body.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a note.
- This injected script could be executed when the note is viewed by another user.
- This allows for various malicious actions such as session hijacking, data theft or other actions as allowed within the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack through a crafted note containing malicious HTML tags and javascript code.
- An attacker could inject the malicious code through the application's note creation or editing functionality.
- The malicious note will cause the vulnerability when another user views it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to create or edit notes in Joplin.
- An attacker would need to convince other users to view the note or share notes with malicious content.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Joplin versions prior to 2.0.9.
- The fix involved filtering out form elements (`button`, `form`, `input`, `select`, `textarea`, `option`, `optgroup`) from the note body.
