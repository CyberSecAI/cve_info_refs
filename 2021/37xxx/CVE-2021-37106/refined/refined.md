Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37106:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a command injection issue present in the CMA service module of Huawei FusionCompute.
*   The software constructs a command using external input (likely related to processing the default certificate file).
*   Insufficient validation of the user-provided input leads to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is that the system is vulnerable to command injection due to inadequate input validation when processing the default certificate file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the system.
*   This could result in a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves gaining access to the target system that is using the default certificate file.
*   An attacker can then inject malicious commands when the system is processing the default certificate file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have access to the target system.
*   The target system has to be using the default certificate file for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
*   The attacker must be able to provide malicious input when processing the default certificate file.
