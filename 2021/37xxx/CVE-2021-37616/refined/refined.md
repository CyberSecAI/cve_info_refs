{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference in the `Exiv2::Internal::resolveLens0x8ff` function. This occurs because the function does not properly check if the iterator returned by `findKey` is valid before dereferencing it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS). The application will crash due to the null pointer dereference.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have access to the system where the vulnerable software is running and the ability to execute the vulnerable code path with a crafted image file. This requires the victim to process the crafted image file using Exiv2 with the `-p t` or `-P t` option.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted image file to a user who then processes the image using Exiv2 with the `-p t` or `-P t` option."
  },
  "additional_information": {
        "affected_versions": "Exiv2 versions 0.27.4 and earlier are affected by this vulnerability.",
        "patched_versions": "The vulnerability is fixed in Exiv2 version 0.27.5 RC1.",
        "extra_details": "The vulnerability is triggered only when printing the interpreted (translated) data, which requires the extra command line option `-p t` or `-P t`."
