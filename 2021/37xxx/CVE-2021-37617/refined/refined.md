Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37617:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Nextcloud Desktop Client, during installation, executes an uninstaller script (`Uninstall.exe`) to remove remnants of previous installations. However, it was searching for this `Uninstall.exe` in the `C:\` directory, which is writable by regular users, making it possible for a malicious actor to place a malicious executable at the location where the client was looking for the uninstaller.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Untrusted Search Path:** The client was searching for the uninstaller executable in a location that was not secured and writeable by regular users. This falls under CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious user could create a fake `Uninstall.exe` file in the `C:\` directory.
- When the Nextcloud Desktop Client installer ran, it would execute the malicious `Uninstall.exe` with administrative privileges, allowing for arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves a malicious user placing a malicious `Uninstall.exe` in the `C:\` directory before the Nextcloud Desktop Client installer is executed.
- This requires write access to the `C:\` directory, which is normally available for standard users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have write permissions to the `C:\` directory.
- They also need to have a malicious executable that they can place at the vulnerable location, and then trick the user into running the installer that triggers the execution of the malicious executable.
