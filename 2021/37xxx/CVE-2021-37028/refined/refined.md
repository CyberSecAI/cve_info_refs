Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an OS command injection flaw in the command line interface of the Huawei EchoLife HG8045Q ONT (Optical Network Terminal) device.
- The command-line interface, designed for network operator maintenance, fails to properly process certain crafted inputs. This allows execution of arbitrary BusyBox-implemented commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands due to insufficient input validation in the command-line interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who has enabled the command-line interface and has administrator privileges can execute arbitrary OS commands on the device.
- This could lead to a range of malicious activities, including:
    - **Confidentiality Impact:**  Accessing sensitive data stored on the device.
    - **Integrity Impact:**  Modifying system configurations, installing malware, or causing other changes to the device's behavior.
    - **Availability Impact:**  Disrupting the device's normal operation, potentially causing denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent network (A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Adjacent Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
- **Enabled Command Line Interface:** The command line interface must be enabled on the target device.
- **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker needs administrator credentials for the device to use the command line interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable software versions are:
    - V300R016C00SPC110
    - V300R018C10
- Huawei has released patches to address this vulnerability:
    - V300R016C00SPC130 (for V300R016C00SPC110)
    - R18C10SPC152 (for V300R018C10)
- The CVSS v3 score is 6.8 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), indicating a significant risk.
- The CVSS v2 score is 7.7 (AV:A/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C).
