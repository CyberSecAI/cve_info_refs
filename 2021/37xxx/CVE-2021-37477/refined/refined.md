The provided content details multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in NavigateCMS version 2.9.4 r1561.

**Root Cause:** The primary root cause across all identified vulnerabilities is the lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-supplied inputs before being used in SQL queries. Specifically, several parameters, such as `block-order`, `id`, `products-order`, `template-properties-order`, and `children_order`, are directly incorporated into SQL queries without validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** The application is susceptible to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization in multiple locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
*   **Arbitrary SQL Query Execution:** Execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
*   **Data Breach:** Potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, an attacker might be able to gain administrative privileges by exploiting SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious HTTP requests containing SQL injection payloads in vulnerable parameters. This is done via GET and POST requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:**  The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameters and the format of the HTTP request to inject SQL code.

**Specific Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **`block_order` Injection:** Located in `blocks.php`, the `blocks-order` parameter is used unsafely in `block.class.php` within the `reorder` function.
2.  **`id` Injection (Comments):** Found in `items.php` and `products.php`, the `id` parameter, when used in `change_comment_status` action, is not validated when updating or deleting comments.
3.  **`products_order` Injection:** Present in `products.php`, the `products-order` parameter is used unsafely in `product.class.php` within the `reorder` function.
4.  **`id` Injection (Products):** Present in `products.php`, the `id` parameter is not sanitized when changing comment status.
5.  **`template-properties-order` Injection:** Located in `templates.php`, the `template-properties-order` parameter is used unsafely in `property.class.php` within the `reorder` function.
6.  **`children_order` Injection:** Found in `structure.php`, the `children_order` parameter is used unsafely in `structure.class.php` within the `reorder` function.
