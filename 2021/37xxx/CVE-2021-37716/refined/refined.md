- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist when processing specially crafted packets destined to the PAPI (Aruba Networks AP management protocol) UDP port (8211).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Classic Buffer Overflow (CWE-120)
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Denial of service and/or remote code execution in the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted packets to the PAPI UDP port (8211).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the PAPI UDP port (8211). No authentication is required.
