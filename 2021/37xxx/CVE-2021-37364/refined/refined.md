  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure file permissions and unquoted service paths allow low-privilege users to replace legitimate executables with malicious ones.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insecure file/folder permissions",
    "Unquoted service paths"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local Privilege Escalation. A low-privilege user can gain NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM privileges by replacing system executables and triggering a restart or service execution",
