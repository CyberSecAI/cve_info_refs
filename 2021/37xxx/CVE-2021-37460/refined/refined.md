Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Lack of input validation in the Axon PBX software allows an attacker to inject JavaScript code into various fields.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, both stored and reflected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of a user's browser when interacting with the Axon PBX web interface. This could allow for session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript through various input fields, including:
    - Extension name
    - Line name
    - Outbound dialing plan
    - Blacklisted IPs
    - SIP rule configurations
    - Primary phone number
    - Customer name
- Reflected XSS can be triggered through specific parameters in URLs such as `/planprop?id=`, `/extensionsinstruction?id=`, and `/ipblacklist?errorip=`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Axon PBX system.
- Remote access to the Axon PBX web interface is required.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Axon PBX version 2.22 and earlier.
- The vendor, NCH Software, is aware of the vulnerability (based on the provided text).
- The XSS can be stored, meaning the malicious payload persists in the database.
- The XSS can also be reflected, meaning the malicious payload is reflected back to the user within the server's response.
