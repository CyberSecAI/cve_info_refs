Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37330:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or validation of uploaded files, specifically in the "Avatar upload" feature within the "My Profile" section of the Booking Core application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application allows users to upload SVG files containing embedded JavaScript.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application does not restrict the type or content of files uploaded as avatars.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   When a malicious SVG file is uploaded as an avatar, any user who views the profile containing the malicious avatar will trigger the embedded JavaScript, leading to XSS.
*   This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Data theft
    *   Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the "Avatar upload" feature in the "My Profile" section.
*   An attacker uploads a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript code.
*   When another user/admin views the profile, the stored XSS payload is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a registered user with the ability to upload an avatar.
*   The attacker needs to upload a crafted malicious SVG file containing JavaScript code.
