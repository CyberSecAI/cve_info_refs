The provided content is related to a commit that addresses a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of document names, specifically within the `audio`, `newMedia`, and `wrappers` components. The original code used `doc.file_name` which was vulnerable to XSS when rendering the name of a file. The fix replaces `file_name` with `fileName` after the name of a file is passed through `RichTextProcessor.wrapEmojiText()` which encodes it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application was vulnerable to XSS attacks by injecting malicious code into document names. This was due to the application displaying document names without encoding or sanitizing them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the document name field. This code could be executed within the user's browser when the document name is displayed, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, modify content or perform other malicious actions.
* **Data Theft:**  An attacker could potentially steal sensitive information through XSS attacks
* **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could hijack user sessions

**Attack Vectors:**
* **File Upload:** An attacker could upload a file with a specially crafted name containing malicious JavaScript code.
* **Document Name Display:** The malicious code is executed when the application displays the file name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Ability to Upload Files/Manipulate document metadata:** The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the application, or have a mechanism to manipulate document metadata containing the file name.
