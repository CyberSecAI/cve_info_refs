- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The software lacks proper control of interaction frequency, allowing an attacker to attempt username enumeration via brute force.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper control of interaction frequency (CWE-799).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could enumerate valid usernames on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker on the same network as the affected system can attempt to brute-force usernames.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be in the same network as the vulnerable system, and no authentication is required.
