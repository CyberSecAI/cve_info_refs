An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the use of named pipes. The issue results from allowing an untrusted process to impersonate the client of a pipe. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM. |

# [CA8223] Local privilege escalation vulnerability fixed in ESET products for Windows

ESET Customer Advisory 2022-0004
January 31, 2022
Severity: High

#### Summary

A report of a potential local privilege escalation vulnerability was submitted to ESET by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI). It potentially allows an attacker to misuse the AMSI scanning feature in specific cases. ESET mitigated the issue and recommends using the most recently released product versions, as detailed below.

#### Details

On November 18, 2021, ESET became aware of a potential vulnerability of local privilege escalation in its products for Windows. According to the report, submitted by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), an attacker who is able to get `SeImpersonatePrivilege` can misuse the AMSI scanning feature to elevate to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` in some cases. The `SeImpersonatePrivilege` is by default available to the local Administrators group and the device's Local Service accounts, which are already highly privileged and thus limit the impact of this vulnerability.

ESET investigated and verified this report and prepared new builds of its products that are not susceptible to this vulnerability.

The CVE ID reserved by ESET for this vulnerability is CVE-2021-37852 with the following CVSS v3 vector: [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1).

To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing exploits that take advantage of this vulnerability in the wild.

#### Solution

ESET prepared the following fixed product versions that are not susceptible to the vulnerability and recommends that users upgrade to them as soon as possible:

##### An alternative way to eliminate attack surface

The attack surface can also be eliminated by disabling the **Enable advanced scanning via AMSI** option in ESET products’ Advanced setup.

However, ESET strongly recommends performing an upgrade to a fixed product version and only applying this workaround when the upgrade is not possible for an important reason.
