      "is_relevant": true,
      "details": "The provided text indicates that the Axon Virtual PBX software, which is a legacy program no longer supported, has a security issue. The administrator setup for this program can have access to files on the system, which poses a security risk. This is described as a 'Security Notice', and it means that an attacker who has administrative access to the PBX can potentially access other files on the system. This could lead to compromise of sensitive files on the machine."

      "is_relevant": true,
      "details": "The github content provides a reference to a potential XSS vulnerability in Axon 2.22 software. This is based on the file name, `Axon_2.22_XSS.md`. While the file content itself is not available in this context, it indicates that the identified vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue, which was not mentioned in the vendor description. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application's pages, potentially gaining unauthorized access or performing malicious actions on the user's behalf."

  ],
  "summary": {
        "root_cause": "The root cause is related to the administrator access of the software having access to the file system, and also the presence of an XSS vulnerability in version 2.22 of the software. This is likely caused by improper handling of user input or insufficient access controls, or in the case of the XSS, insufficient sanitization of user-provided input.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control: Administrator of the application has access to files on the system.",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Version 2.22 contains an XSS vulnerability."
    ],
        "impact": "An attacker with administrative access to the Axon Virtual PBX software could gain access to files on the system, leading to potential data breaches or further compromise. The XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious code, leading to unauthorized actions by a user of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting the administrator's file system access within the application.",
      "Exploiting the XSS vulnerability through malicious script injection."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "To exploit the file access issue, an attacker needs to be set up as an administrator in the application. For XSS, the attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script."
