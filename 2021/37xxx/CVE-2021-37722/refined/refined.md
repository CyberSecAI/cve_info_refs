- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Authenticated command injection vulnerabilities exist in the ArubaOS command line interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities results in the ability to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged user on the underlying operating system, allowing an attacker to fully compromise the device.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is present in the ArubaOS command line interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker requires valid credentials to access the command line interface of the affected system.
