SSA-208530: File parsing vulnerabilities in IFC adapter in NX

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

SUMMARY

Siemens NX is affected by two vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application reads ifc ﬁles.
If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with the affected application, this could lead to an access
violation, and potentially also to arbitrary code execution on the target host system.

Siemens has released updates for NX and recommends to update to the latest version to ﬁx the
vulnerabilities. Siemens recommends to avoid opening of untrusted ﬁles from unknown sources.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

NX 1980 Series:
All versions < V1984

Update to V1984 or later version
https://support.sw.siemens.com/ (login required)

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Avoid opening ﬁles from unknown sources in NX

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

NX software is an integrated toolset that helps to develop design, simulation, and manufacturing solutions
by supporting various aspects of product development allowing the designer to optimize shape to achieve
a multidisciplinary design.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37202

The IFC adapter in affected application contains a use-after-free vulnerability that could be triggered
while parsing user-supplied IFC ﬁles. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in
the context of the current process.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37203

The plmxmlAdapterIFC.dll contains an out-of-bounds read while parsing user supplied IFC ﬁles which
could result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. This could allow an attacker to cause a
denial-of-service condition or read sensitive information from memory locations.

SUMMARY

Siemens has released a new version for Solid Edge that ﬁxes multiple ﬁle parsing vulnerabilities which
could be triggered when the application reads ﬁles in IFC, JT or OBJ formats.

If a user is tricked to opening a malicious ﬁle using the affected application this could lead the application
to crash, or potentially arbitrary code execution on the target host system.

Siemens recommends to update to the latest version and to limit opening of ﬁles from unknown sources
in the affected products.
