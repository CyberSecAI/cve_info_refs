- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command within the HPE Aruba Instant (IAP) command line interface. This allows for command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection (CWE-77)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges on the underlying operating system, potentially leading to system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks via the command line interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have high privileges to access the affected command line interface.
