Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2021-37636.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `tf.raw_ops.SparseDenseCwiseDiv` operation in TensorFlow was vulnerable to a division-by-zero error because it did not explicitly check for zero values in the dense tensor before performing the division. The code used a common class for binary operations and failed to handle the division by zero case separately.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Division by zero vulnerability.
- Lack of input validation in the `SparseDenseCwiseDiv` operation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to a floating-point exception (FPE), which can crash the TensorFlow process or lead to unexpected program behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a TensorFlow program that uses `tf.raw_ops.SparseDenseCwiseDiv` with a dense tensor containing zero values at indices corresponding to non-zero elements in the sparse tensor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide the input tensors to the vulnerable `tf.raw_ops.SparseDenseCwiseDiv` operation, either by controlling the program that uses the operation or by injecting malicious input into a vulnerable system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was patched in commit d9204be9f49520cdaaeb2541d1dc5187b23f31d9.
- The fix was included in TensorFlow versions 2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1, and 2.6.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
