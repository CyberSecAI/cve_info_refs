Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a file upload flaw within Nucleus CMS v3.71.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allows users to upload files without proper validation of the file's content and type. This lack of validation allows an attacker to upload files with malicious content.
- **Path Manipulation/Insecure Upload Path:** The attacker can manipulate the upload path to bypass the intended upload directory and place the file in a location without `.htaccess` protection.
- **Lack of `.htaccess` Protection:** Files placed in unprotected paths can be accessed directly through the web server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a specially crafted `.htaccess` file, the attacker can instruct the web server to interpret files with specific extensions (e.g., `.jpg`) as PHP code.
- **Remote Shell Access:** The attacker can then upload a "shell" disguised as a picture (e.g. a file named shell.jpg containing PHP code). This allows them to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Full Website Compromise:** Ultimately, the attacker could potentially gain complete control of the website resources and permissions, leading to a full website compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload Feature:** The attacker uses the file upload functionality of the CMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User (potentially):** While the issue doesn't specify if authentication is needed for the file upload, it is likely that the attacker needs some level of access to the CMS.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable CMS Version:** The attacker must know they are targeting Nucleus CMS v3.71.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Files:** The attacker requires the ability to create an `.htaccess` file with malicious directives and a shell file containing PHP code disguised as an image.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided GitHub issue thread contains more specific details than the official CVE description, such as the usage of a malicious .htaccess file to enable execution of PHP code within other file extensions.
- There is a suggested fix, but the issue is not resolved.
