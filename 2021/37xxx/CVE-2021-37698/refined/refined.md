Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-37698:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of TLS server certificate validation in the `InfluxdbWriter` and `Influxdb2Writer` components of Icinga 2. Despite having a Certificate Authority (CA) specified, the server's certificate was not being verified.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing TLS Server Certificate Validation:** The core weakness is the absence of proper verification of the server's certificate when connecting to InfluxDB time series databases (TSDBs) over TLS. This allows a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.
- **CWE-295:**  The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-295, which refers to "Improper Certificate Validation".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** An attacker could intercept the communication between Icinga 2 and the TSDB.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially manipulate data sent to the TSDB.
- **Credential Theft:**  If the TSDB writer feature uses credentials for authentication, these credentials could be stolen by an attacker performing a MitM attack, potentially granting them unauthorized access to the TSDB.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Spoofable Infrastructure:** The primary attack vector involves a network infrastructure where an attacker can spoof the TSDB server. This can be done through techniques such as ARP spoofing, DNS poisoning, or other methods.
- **TLS Interception:** The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept and manipulate the TLS connection between Icinga 2 and the TSDB server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the network path between the Icinga 2 instance and the TSDB.
- **MitM Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and intercept/manipulate TLS connections.
- **Spoofing Ability:** The attacker needs the ability to spoof the TSDB server to redirect the Icinga 2 instance's traffic to their malicious server.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Icinga 2 versions 2.5.0 through 2.13.0.
- Patched versions include 2.13.1, 2.12.6, and 2.11.11.
- The fix involves adding proper TLS server certificate validation to the affected metric writers.
- A blog post is available with more details about the security release.
- Users are advised to not only upgrade but also change the TSDB writer credentials if used
