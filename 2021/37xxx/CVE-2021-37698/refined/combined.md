Package        : icinga2
Version        : 2.6.0-2+deb9u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-32739 CVE-2021-32743 CVE-2021-37698
Debian Bug     : 991494

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Icinga 2, a general-purpose
monitoring application. An attacker could retrieve sensitive
information such as service passwords and ticket salt by querying the
web API, or by intercepting unsufficiently checked encrypted
connections.

CVE-2021-32739

    A vulnerability exists that may allow privilege escalation for
    authenticated API users. With a read-ony user's credentials, an
    attacker can view most attributes of all config objects including
    `ticket_salt` of `ApiListener`. This salt is enough to compute a
    ticket for every possible common name (CN). A ticket, the master
    node's certificate, and a self-signed certificate are enough to
    successfully request the desired certificate from Icinga. That
    certificate may in turn be used to steal an endpoint or API user's
    identity.  See also complementary manual procedures:
    <https://icinga.com/blog/2021/07/15/releasing-icinga-2-12-5-and-2-11-10/#change-ticket-salt>
    <https://icinga.com/blog/2021/07/15/releasing-icinga-2-12-5-and-2-11-10/#replace-icinga-ca>

CVE-2021-32743

    Some of the Icinga 2 features that require credentials for
    external services expose those credentials through the API to
    authenticated API users with read permissions for the
    corresponding object types. IdoMysqlConnection and
    IdoPgsqlConnection exposes the password of the user used to
    connect to the database. An attacker who obtains these credentials
    can impersonate Icinga to these services and add, modify and
    delete information there. If credentials with more permissions are
    in use, this increases the impact accordingly.

CVE-2021-37698

    InfluxdbWriter and Influxdb2Writer do not verify the server's
    certificate despite a certificate authority being
    specified. Icinga 2 instances which connect to any of the
    mentioned time series databases (TSDBs) using TLS over a spoofable
    infrastructure should immediately upgrade. Such instances should
    also change the credentials (if any) used by the TSDB writer
    feature to authenticate against the TSDB.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.6.0-2+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your icinga2 packages.

For the detailed security status of icinga2 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/icinga2>

[Blogpost](https://icinga.com/blog/2021/08/19/icinga-2-13-1-security-release/)

The main focus of this version is a security vulnerability in the TLS certificate verification of our metrics writers ElasticsearchWriter, GelfWriter, InfluxdbWriter and Influxdb2Writer.

Version 2.13.1 also fixes two issues introduced with the 2.13.0 release.

## Security

* Add TLS server certificate validation to ElasticsearchWriter, GelfWriter, InfluxdbWriter and Influxdb2Writer ([GHSA-cxfm-8j5v-5qr2](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/security/advisories/GHSA-cxfm-8j5v-5qr2))

Depending on your setup, manual intervention beyond installing the new versions may be required, so please read the more detailed information in the [release blog post](https://icinga.com/blog/2021/08/19/icinga-2-13-1-security-release//) carefully.

## Bugfixes

* IDO PgSQL: Fix a string quoting regression introduced in 2.13.0 [#8958](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/8958)
* ApiListener: Automatically fall back to IPv4 in default configuration on systems without IPv6 support [#8961](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/8961)

# Missing TLS server certificate validation in ElasticsearchWriter, GelfWriter, InfluxdbWriter and Influxdb2Writer

Low

[N-o-X](/N-o-X)
published
GHSA-cxfm-8j5v-5qr2
Aug 19, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

v2.5.0 through v2.13.0

## Patched versions

v2.13.1, v2.12.6 and v2.11.11

## Description

### Impact

Despite a CA is specified, none of ElasticsearchWriter, GelfWriter, InfluxdbWriter and Influxdb2Writer verify the server's certificate.

### Patches

Icinga 2 instances which connect to any of the mentioned TSDBs using TLS over a spoofable infrastructure should immediately upgrade and change the credentials (if any) used by the TSDB writer feature to authenticate against the TSDB.

### Workarounds

None.

[`88ed374`](/Icinga/icinga2/commit/88ed37454b7d8290d0f309784a166ab0d3c23326)

[Blogpost](https://icinga.com/blog/2021/08/19/icinga-2-13-1-security-release/)

The focus of this version is a security vulnerability in the TLS certificate verification of our metrics writers ElasticsearchWriter, GelfWriter and InfluxdbWriter.

## Security

* Add TLS server certificate validation to ElasticsearchWriter, GelfWriter and InfluxdbWriter ([GHSA-cxfm-8j5v-5qr2](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/security/advisories/GHSA-cxfm-8j5v-5qr2))

Depending on your setup, manual intervention beyond installing the new versions may be required, so please read the more detailed information in the [release blog post](https://icinga.com/blog/2021/08/19/icinga-2-13-1-security-release/) carefully
