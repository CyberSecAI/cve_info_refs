- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An authenticated local path traversal vulnerability exists in the ArubaOS web-based management interface and CLI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with physical access can impact the integrity and confidentiality of critical files on the underlying operating system, potentially leading to modification or disclosure of sensitive data and impacting the availability of the ArubaOS instance.
- **Attack vectors**: Local, physical access to the controller is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker requires physical access to the controller and must have valid credentials to authenticate with either the web-based interface or the CLI.
