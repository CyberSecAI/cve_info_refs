Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-37562:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check within the Wi-Fi driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The primary weakness is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the driver attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer. This is due to the missing bounds check which allows this to occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service condition on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Proximal:** The attack can be carried out remotely by an attacker within close proximity of the vulnerable device, due to it being within the WiFi range.
- **Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS):** The vulnerability is specifically triggered through the use of WPS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be in the proximity range of the WiFi signal of the targeted device.
- **WPS interaction**:  The attacker needs to interact with the WPS functionality of the vulnerable device to trigger the flaw.
