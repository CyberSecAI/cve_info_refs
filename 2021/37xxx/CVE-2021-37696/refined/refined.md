Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-37696

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `MassDM` cog for Red-DiscordBot allowed users to format messages using attributes of Discord objects (member, role, server) in a way that exposed sensitive information. The original code used the format function directly on the discord objects, allowing access to all object attributes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive attributes of Discord objects (users, roles, servers) through message formatting. Attackers could craft messages to reveal internal data.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability existed because the message formatting function did not sanitize or restrict the attributes that could be accessed from the discord objects, leading to arbitrary access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Leakage:** Exploitation could lead to leakage of sensitive information, such as internal IDs, creation dates, color codes, and other potentially private details of users, roles and servers.
- This information could be used for targeted attacks or other malicious purposes.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Message Formatting:** The attack vector is through the `message` parameter of the MassDM command. An attacker could craft a malicious message using format specifiers to reveal object attributes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **User with MassDM command privileges:** An attacker would need to be a user who is able to execute the MassDM command.
- **Knowledge of format specifiers:** The attacker would need to be aware of how to use format specifiers to extract specific attributes.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was patched by creating "safe" model classes (`SafeMember`, `SafeRole`, `SafeGuild`) that only expose specific, non-sensitive attributes when formatting messages.
- The vulnerable versions include commit `c53a2e5566bd5f923939ca1edd10524d40f00a5e` which was fixed by commit `92325be650a6c17940cc52611797533ed95dbbe1`.
- Workarounds include unloading the MassDM cog or disabling the `[p]massdm` command.
