- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Kibana's JIRA and IBM Resilient connectors could be used to return HTTP response data on internal hosts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure via HTTP response data from internal hosts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user with the ability to create connectors can view limited HTTP response data on hosts accessible to the cluster, which might be intended to be hidden from public view.
- **Attack vectors**: By creating and using the JIRA or IBM Resilient connectors in Kibana.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to create connectors in Kibana.
