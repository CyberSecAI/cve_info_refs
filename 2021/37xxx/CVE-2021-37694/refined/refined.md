- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Code injection through manipulation of the `operationId` field within an AsyncAPI document, which is then used to generate code by the `@asyncapi/java-spring-cloud-stream-template` library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Code Injection (CWE-94), the library directly uses user-supplied input (specifically, the `operationId` value from the AsyncAPI document) to generate code without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary code into the generated Java Spring Cloud Stream application, leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the application. The injected code will be executed when the Spring application is started
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious AsyncAPI document with a specially crafted `operationId` field, and then using the `@asyncapi/java-spring-cloud-stream-template` tool to generate a Spring Cloud Stream application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious AsyncAPI document to the `@asyncapi/java-spring-cloud-stream-template` tool for code generation.
