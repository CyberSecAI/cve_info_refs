Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Lack of input validation in Axon PBX software. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it, leading to XSS. Both stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities are present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking (stealing cookies or session tokens).
    - Defacement of the web interface.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
    - Potential data exfiltration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker can inject JavaScript payloads into multiple fields within the Axon PBX system:
    - Stored XSS:
        - Extension name
        - Line name
        - Outbound dialing plan
        - Blacklist IP
        - SipRule
        - Primary phone
        - Customer name
    - Reflected XSS:
        - `/planprop?id=`
        - `/extensionsinstruction?id=`
        - `/ipblacklist?errorip=`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to have a valid account with access to the Axon PBX interface.
- Network access: The attacker needs network connectivity to the Axon PBX system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor states that Axon PBX is a legacy program that they no longer support, this increases the risk.
- The official description is missing, this information provides more detail than what is available.
