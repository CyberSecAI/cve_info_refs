- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The TechRadar plugin for Confluence is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a lack of proper input sanitization. Specifically, JavaScript code entered in the title of a radar is not sanitized and is executed when the TechRadar plugin is opened.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, or other client-side attacks against users of the Confluence instance.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects the malicious JavaScript code into the title field of a radar within the TechRadar plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Confluence instance with the ability to create or edit radars within the TechRadar plugin.
