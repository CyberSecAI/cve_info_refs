# Division by 0 in `ResourceScatterDiv`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-ch4f-829c-v5pw
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.3.4, 2.4.3,2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.ResourceScatterDiv` is vulnerable to a division by 0 error:

```
import tensorflow as tf

v= tf.Variable([1,2,3])
tf.raw_ops.ResourceScatterDiv(
  resource=v.handle,
  indices=[1],
  updates=[0])
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/resource_variable_ops.cc#L865) uses a common class for all binary operations but fails to treat the division by 0 case separately.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [4aacb30888638da75023e6601149415b39763d76](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4aacb30888638da75023e6601149415b39763d76).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-37642

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
