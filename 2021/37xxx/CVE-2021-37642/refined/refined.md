Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37642:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `tf.raw_ops.ResourceScatterDiv` operation in TensorFlow was vulnerable to a division-by-zero error. The implementation used a common class for all binary operations but lacked specific handling for the division by zero case when the updates tensor contained a zero value.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of division by zero within the `ResourceScatterDiv` operation. This operation is used to divide the values of a variable at specified indices with values provided in the updates tensor.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A division-by-zero error would occur when the updates tensor contained a 0, which could lead to a crash or unexpected behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by crafting a TensorFlow program that uses `tf.raw_ops.ResourceScatterDiv` with an `updates` tensor containing a zero at indices they want to update with division operation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input values to the `tf.raw_ops.ResourceScatterDiv` operation specifically the `updates` tensor.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute TensorFlow code.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit [4aacb30888638da75023e6601149415b39763d76](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4aacb30888638da75023e6601149415b39763d76) by adding a check to prevent division by zero for CPU devices. The fix was included in TensorFlow versions 2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1 and 2.6.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
