- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of parameters when dealing with certain messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to system resources.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted message to the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the device over the network. They do not necessarily need to be authenticated on the device.
