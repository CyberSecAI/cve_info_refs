Root cause of vulnerability:
The `GatherNd` and `Gather` implementations in TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) do not properly handle negative indices. Specifically, these operations do not check if the provided indices are negative before accessing memory.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Heap out-of-bounds (OOB) read: By providing a negative index, the code attempts to access memory outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can read arbitrary data from the heap by carefully crafting a model with negative values in the `indices` tensor, which can lead to information disclosure.

Attack vectors:
- Crafting a malicious TensorFlow Lite model: An attacker can create a TFLite model that includes `GatherNd` or `Gather` operations and uses negative values for the indices input.
- The attacker needs to control the model and input to the `GatherNd` and `Gather` ops.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted model to the vulnerable TFLite implementation.
