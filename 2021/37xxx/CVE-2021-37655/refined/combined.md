# Heap OOB in `ResourceScatterUpdate`

High

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-7fvx-3jfc-2cpc
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can trigger a read from outside of bounds of heap allocated data by sending invalid arguments to `tf.raw_ops.ResourceScatterUpdate`:

```
import tensorflow as tf

v = tf.Variable([b'vvv'])
tf.raw_ops.ResourceScatterUpdate(
  resource=v.handle,
  indices=[0],
  updates=['1', '2', '3', '4', '5'])
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/resource_variable_ops.cc#L919-L923) has an incomplete validation of the relationship between the shapes of `indices` and `updates`: instead of checking that the shape of `indices` is a prefix of the shape of `updates` (so that broadcasting can happen), code only checks that the number of elements in these two tensors are in a divisibility relationship.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [01cff3f986259d661103412a20745928c727326f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/01cff3f986259d661103412a20745928c727326f).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
