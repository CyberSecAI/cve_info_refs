Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37593:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization on the `id` parameter in the `produit_details.php` file of the Peel Shopping application. This parameter is used in a SQL query without prior validation or sanitization, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied data from the `id` GET parameter into an SQL query without sanitization or using parameterized queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can read sensitive data from the database.
- **Integrity Violation:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Potential Full Database Compromise:** The provided PoCs allow enumeration of the database server version, database name and tables which could lead to a full database compromise and lateral movement if applicable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `produit_details.php` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the `id` parameter.
  - Vulnerable URL: `http://localhost/peel-shopping_9_4_0/achat/produit_details.php?id=[SQLi]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user.
- **Network access to the application:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to enumerate the database name, database server version, and table names using time-based SQL injection techniques.
- The vulnerability was present in version 9.4.0 of the Peel Shopping application.
- The fix involves using `intval()` to cast the `id` parameter to an integer, which prevents SQL injection.
