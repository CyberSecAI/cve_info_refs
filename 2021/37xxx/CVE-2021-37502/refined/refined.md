The provided content relates to CVE-2021-37502.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation in the `add()` function within `/gui/accounts.php`. User-supplied data, specifically the username, is not properly sanitized before being stored in the `config/accounts.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the user's username field and persisted in the `config/accounts.php` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When an authenticated user accesses the `/gui/accounts.php` page, the stored XSS payload is executed within the user's browser.
- This can lead to unauthorized actions, such as session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious behavior within the context of the authenticated user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects a malicious payload within the "username" field when adding a new user via the `/gui/accounts.php` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to add new user accounts.
