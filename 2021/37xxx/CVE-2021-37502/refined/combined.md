| Hi, thanks for reporting this. However an attacker must be authenticated to use that vulnerability which somehow defeats its purpose. Stealing session IDs in that scenario would giving him the same permissions he already has to actually use that vulnerability.  Still, you are right it shouldn't be possible and therefore it is fixed in the latest release. 🙂 |
