- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Leaf (a templating engine) does not escape strings passed to tags as variables, allowing injection of unsanitized data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the lack of output sanitization of user-controlled data passed to Leaf template variables.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into generated Leaf pages, which could lead to XSS attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious scripts into a variable used in a Leaf template. This requires the attacker to control or influence user input that is then passed to Leaf as a variable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to find a variable that is rendered with their unsanitized data. The attacker also needs to be in a position where they can influence user input which is then passed as variable to Leaf.
