Response:
{
  "CVE-2021-37712": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from insufficient symlink protection in node-tar when handling tar archives containing two directories and a symlink with names that normalize to the same value due to unicode normalization or use of short path names on Windows.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient symlink protection, directory cache poisoning, improper path normalization, reliance on case-insensitive filesystems behavior.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary file creation and overwrite, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted tar archives designed to exploit the path normalization and symlink handling vulnerabilities.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to create and distribute malicious tar archives. The attacker does not need any specific privileges."
