# [CVE-2021-37421](https://blog.stmcyber.com/vulns/cve-2021-37421/)

**Name**

Admin portal access restriction bypass via X-Forwarded-For header

**CVSS score**

5.3 (Medium)

**CVSS vector**

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

**Product name**

ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus

**Confirmed exploitable versions**

< 6104

**Researcher**

Krzysztof Andrusiak and Marcin Ogorzelski

**Description**

ADSelfService Plus allows administrators to restrict Admin portal access based on IP address. An attacker can bypass this security mechanism using "X-Forwarded-For" header set to whitelisted IP address.

**Proof-of-concept**

1. Enable "Allow/Restrict Admin portal access based on IP Addresses" in ADSSP's Logon Settings. Set "Restricted IP Addresses" to IP of a machine which will be used in next steps.
2. Go to `/adminLogin.cc` - message "You don't have permission to access this page !" should be returned.
3. Using intercepting proxy add `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to all requests.
4. Go to `/adminLogin.cc` again - this time user can log in as administrator, bypassing IP address restriction.

**Timeline**

* 17-03-2021 - Vulnerability reported to vendor
* 18-03-2021 - First response from vendor
* 08-05-2021 - Fixed version release
* 30-08-2021 - Public disclosure
* 21-02-2022 - PoC release

## STM Cyber Statement regarding the Internal Control System

Validity of the Internal Control System

The effectiveness of the Internal Control System (ISC) is based on a written statement of the ICM Policy. This document, addressed to all employees, presents the company's official position on turnover control and the implementation and maintenance of WSK.

The Company's policy regarding international trade in goods, technologies, and services of strategic importance

Our company conducts foreign trade in goods of strategic importance by the law of the Republic of Poland, international regulations, and principles resulting from non-proliferation agreements in which Poland participates.

Aware of the role we play in ensuring national and international security by preventing uncontrolled trade in dual-use goods and weapons, we have implemented and maintained an Internal Control System in our company.

If it turns out that a given transaction is inconsistent with national law or the potential contractor raises reasonable suspicions of violating international rules on trade in goods, technologies, and services of strategic importance, the transaction will not be completed.

Our company excludes the possibility of making profits in a manner contrary to the trade control policy.

All employees, entities, and cooperating persons who are familiar with the requirements of the Internal Control System are obliged to comply with them and immediately inform the WSK Representative about any transactions, practices, or attempted actions that are inconsistent with applicable law.

If non-compliance with the requirements is detected, the company takes appropriate corrective, elimination, and preventive actions.

The involvement of all employees in maintaining the functionality of the Internal Control System increases trust in our company, making it more competitive and credible.

Employees are obliged to comply with the principles set out in this statement under penalty of professional liability.
