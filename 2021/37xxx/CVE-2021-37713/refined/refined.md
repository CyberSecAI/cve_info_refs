  "CVE-2021-37713": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. This is due to insufficient sanitization of relative paths on Windows systems.",
    "details": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient path sanitization within the node-tar library when handling tar files on Windows. Specifically, it fails to properly sanitize paths that specify a drive letter different from the extraction target, e.g., `C:some\\path` when the extraction is to `D:\\extraction\\dir`. The path is resolved against the current working directory of the specified drive, not the extraction target directory. Additionally, `..` path portions immediately after the drive letter such as `C:../foo` are not properly sanitized.",
    "affected_versions": "6 <=6.1.8 || 5 <=5.0.9 || <=4.4.17",
    "patched_versions": "4.4.18 || 5.0.10 || 6.1.9",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient path sanitization on Windows systems when extracting tar files, allowing for path traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-22"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution",
    "attack_vectors": "Extracting a specially crafted tar archive on a Windows system.",
     "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted tar archive containing specific path structures to a system using a vulnerable version of node-tar."
