Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-37401:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Plaintext Storage of a Password:** The vulnerability stems from the storage of user credentials in plaintext within files. Specifically, credentials can be found in file servers, backup repositories, or ZLD files saved in SD cards.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password):**  The primary weakness is the lack of encryption or hashing for stored passwords, making them easily readable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** An attacker who gains access to these files can extract the plaintext user credentials.
*   **Unauthorized PLC Program Manipulation:** Using the stolen credentials, an attacker could upload, alter, or download PLC user programs. This may lead to unexpected behavior or cause physical damage to the equipment.
