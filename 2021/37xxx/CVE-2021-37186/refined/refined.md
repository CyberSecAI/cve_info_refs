- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The underlying TCP/IP stack does not properly calculate the random numbers used as Initial Sequence Numbers (ISN).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of insufficiently random values (CWE-330) in the generation of ISNs within the TCP/IP stack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can hijack an ongoing connection or spoof a new one, potentially gaining access to sensitive information. This can lead to traffic interference.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the LAN interface of an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An adjacent attacker with network access to the LAN interface of the vulnerable device.
