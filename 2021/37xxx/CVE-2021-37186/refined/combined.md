RTU 3000 devices

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 5.4

SUMMARY

A vulnerability has been identiﬁed in the underlying TCP/IP stack of LOGO! CMR and SIMATIC RTU
3000 devices. It could allow an attacker with network access to the LAN interface of an affected device to
hijack an ongoing connection or spoof a new one. The WAN interface, however, is not affected.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has not identiﬁed any additional speciﬁc workarounds or mitigations. Please follow the General
Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The devices of the LOGO! CMR family (in combination with the LOGO! logic module) are cost-efﬁcient
communication systems suitable for monitoring and controlling distributed plants and systems via text
message or email. LOGO! CMR devices can send text messages or emails to predeﬁned mobile network
numbers as well as receive text messages from predeﬁned mobile network numbers. The LOGO! CMR
devices offer comfortable Web Based Management commissioning and diagnostics via local and/or
remote access.

The devices of the RTU3000C family are compact telecontrol stations for applications with their own
power supply for autonomous energy systems. They are particularly suited for monitoring and control
of external stations that are not connected to an energy supply network. The RTUs can autonomously
record data with time stamp from connected sensors, pre-process this data and transfer it to a control
center.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37186

The underlying TCP/IP stack does not properly calculate the random numbers used as ISN (Initial
Sequence Numbers). An adjacent attacker with network access to the LAN interface could interfere
with trafﬁc, spoof the connection and gain access to sensitive information.
