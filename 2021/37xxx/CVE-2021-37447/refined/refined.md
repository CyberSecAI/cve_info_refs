Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37447:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The NCH Quorum software has insufficient input validation on file paths in the `logprop`, `documentprop` and `documentdelete` functions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Directory Traversal:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied file paths, allowing an attacker to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to navigate outside of the intended directory.
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Due to directory traversal, an attacker can read arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:**  The `documentdelete` function allows an attacker to delete arbitrary files via path traversal.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files, potentially including configuration files and credentials for other NCH applications stored in `\ProgramData\NCH Software\`.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker can delete system files, causing the system or application to become unstable.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints:
    *   `HOST/logprop?file=/../../../../../../Windows/win.ini` (for file read)
    *   `HOST/documentprop?file=/../../../../../../Windows/win.ini&conference=<conferenceID>` (for file read)
    *   `HOST/documentdelete?file=/../../../../../../Windows/win.ini&conference=<conferenceID>` (for file deletion)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the NCH Quorum application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the NCH Quorum application.
