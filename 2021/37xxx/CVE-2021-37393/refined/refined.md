Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in RPCMS v1.8 as described:

**Vulnerability 1: Admin User Registration**

*   **Root Cause:** The API endpoint for user registration allows users to specify their role, including 'admin', bypassing the intended default of 'member'.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insecure user role assignment during registration, lack of proper input validation and sanitization for the `role` parameter.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can register a new user with admin privileges without requiring administrative access, gaining full control of the system.
*  **Attack Vector:** Attacker sends a POST request to the user registration API endpoint with the `role` parameter set to `admin`.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Must be able to access the user registration API and manipulate POST data.

**Vulnerability 2: Stored XSS (1)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application directly displays the user's nickname in multiple locations without sanitization, allowing for JavaScript injection.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of output encoding for user-controlled data (nickname) displayed in HTML context, specifically in the meta description and title of the author page.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that executes in the browsers of other users viewing the author pages, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker modifies their username/nickname to contain malicious JavaScript, which is then stored in the database. When other users view the author's page, the injected script executes.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to update their user profile nickname.

**Vulnerability 3: Stored XSS (2)**

*   **Root Cause:** The API endpoint for updating a user's profile allows users to directly set their nickname without sanitization or validation, resulting in stored XSS vulnerabilities when displayed on the author pages.
*  **Weaknesses:** Missing input sanitization for nickname in user profile update API, allowing for the storage of malicious scripts.
*   **Impact:**  Similar to vulnerability 2, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into their nickname using the API. The script executes in the browsers of other users when the author pages are viewed.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker uses the user profile update API to set a malicious payload in the nickname parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Must have a valid user account and the ability to access user profile update API endpoint.

In summary, the content describes a lack of input sanitization in user registration and profile update functionalities, as well as direct display of user-controlled data without proper encoding, leading to vulnerabilities in RPCMS v1.8.
