{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure direct object reference of log files of the Import/Export feature",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The system was directly exposing log files without proper access control, allowing unauthorized users to potentially access them by knowing or guessing the file ID.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthorized access to sensitive log files generated by the Import/Export feature.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the file ID in the download request, a malicious actor could access arbitrary log files.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have knowledge of the file ID of the log files they wish to access."
