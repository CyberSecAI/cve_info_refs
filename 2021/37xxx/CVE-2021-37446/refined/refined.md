Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:** The Quorum Telephone Conference Server application, specifically version 2.03 and earlier, is vulnerable to directory traversal due to insufficient input validation when handling file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Directory Traversal (Path Traversal):** The application allows an attacker to use ".." sequences in file parameters to access files and directories outside of the intended webroot or application directory.
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The vulnerability allows not only reading arbitrary files but also deleting them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server's filesystem, including configuration files, potentially containing credentials or other sensitive information from NCH applications.
*   **Denial of Service/Data Loss:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially causing a denial of service or loss of important data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The application exposes vulnerable endpoints through the web interface which are used to read and delete files.
*   The specific vulnerable endpoints are:
    *   `/logprop?file=`: used for reading arbitrary files.
    *   `/documentprop?file=`: used for reading arbitrary files within the context of a conference.
    *   `/documentdelete?file=`: used for deleting arbitrary files within the context of a conference.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Quorum application.
*   The attacker can be remote.
*   The attacker needs access to the web interface of the application to make the requests.

**Additional Details:**
*   The attacker can use the vulnerability to access credential files of other NCH applications because they are often stored in a common location (`\ProgramData\NCH Software\`).
*   The provided exploit examples target `Windows/win.ini` which demonstrates arbitrary file access.
*   The application is described as a "legacy program we no longer support" which is a strong indication that the vulnerability will not be patched.
