Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37671:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check for an empty `indices` tensor within the `tf.raw_ops.Map*` and `tf.raw_ops.OrderedMap*` operations in TensorFlow. Specifically, the code checks for the ascending order of indices but not for the empty state of the `indices` tensor.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing input validation:** The code lacks proper validation for an empty `indices` tensor.
- **Null pointer dereference:** When `indices` is empty, the code attempts to access `findices(i)` without checking if `findices` is actually pointing to a valid memory location resulting in a reference binding to a null pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Undefined behavior:** Exploiting this vulnerability results in undefined behavior due to the null pointer dereference. The specific impact (crash, unexpected results, etc.) would depend on the context in which the vulnerable code is executed.
- Potential denial of service by crashing the application

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing an empty tensor for the `indices` parameter in the `tf.raw_ops.Map*` and `tf.raw_ops.OrderedMap*` operations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `tf.raw_ops.Map*` and `tf.raw_ops.OrderedMap*` operations, specifically the `indices` parameter. This would typically require the attacker to be able to execute TensorFlow code with malicious input.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.6.0.
- The fix is included in TensorFlow versions 2.3.4, 2.4.3 and 2.5.1, and will be included in 2.6.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Low".
