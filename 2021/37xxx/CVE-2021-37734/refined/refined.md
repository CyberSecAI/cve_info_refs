- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal (CWE-22).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with valid credentials can read any file from the underlying filesystem, including system-sensitive files.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrative privileges on the affected device.
