- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An authorization bypass vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to change the password of any user in the system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authorization bypass (CWE-639) through a user-controlled key.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can change any user's password, potentially impersonating any valid user on the affected system, leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack; unauthenticated access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system. They do not need to have any valid credentials.
