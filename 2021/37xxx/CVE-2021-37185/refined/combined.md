GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC Drive Controllers have been designed for the automation of production machines, combining
the functionality of a SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU and a SINAMICS S120 drive control.

SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller is a PC-based version of the SIMATIC S7-1500 Controller including
optional visualization in combination with central I/Os in a compact device.

SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU products have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial
environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU products have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial
environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller is a SIMATIC software controller for PC-based automation solutions.

SIMATIC S7-PLCSIM Advanced simulates S7-1200, S7-1500 and a few other PLC derivatives. Includes
full network access to simulate the PLCs, even in virtualized environments.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

TIM 1531 IRC is a communication module for SIMATIC S7-1500, S7-400, S7-300 with SINAUT ST7,
DNP3 and IEC 60870-5-101/104 with three RJ45 interfaces for communication via IP-based networks
(WAN / LAN) and a RS 232/RS 485 interface for communication via classic WAN networks.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37185

An unauthenticated attacker could cause a denial-of-service condition in a PLC when sending specially
prepared packets over port 102/tcp. A restart of the affected device is needed to restore normal
operations.
