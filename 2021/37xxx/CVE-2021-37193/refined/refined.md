- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability of an unauthenticated attacker to manipulate certain parameters related to user validity status within the SINEMA Remote Connect Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The primary weakness is the susceptibility to unauthorized manipulation of user validity states. This is classified as CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can alter the validity of user accounts, potentially making valid users invalid and vice versa. This could disrupt legitimate access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent network access (AV:A).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the affected SINEMA Remote Connect Server and does not need any prior authentication (PR:N). The attack does not require user interaction (UI:N).
