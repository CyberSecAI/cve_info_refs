SUMMARY

SIMATIC S7-1200 PLC, version V4.5.0 fails to authenticate against conﬁgured passwords when the
affected device was provisioned using TIA Portal V13. This could allow an attacker using TIA Portal V13
or later versions to bypass authentication and download arbitrary programs to the PLC.

Siemens has released an update for SIMATIC S7-1200 and recommends to update to the latest version.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Update to TIA Portal V13 SP1 or any later version before provisioning S7-1200 V4.5.0 devices

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Products of the SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family have been designed for discrete and continuous control in
industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s

environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37172

Affected devices fail to authenticate against conﬁgured passwords when provisioned using TIA Portal
V13. This could allow an attacker using TIA Portal V13 or later versions to bypass authentication and
download arbitrary programs to the PLC. The vulnerability does not occur when TIA Portal V13 SP1
or any later version was used to provision the device.
