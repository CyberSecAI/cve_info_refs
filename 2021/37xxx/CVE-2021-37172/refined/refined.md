- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SIMATIC S7-1200 PLC, version V4.5.0, fails to authenticate against configured passwords when the device was provisioned using TIA Portal V13.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Authentication (CWE-287). The PLC does not correctly authenticate passwords when provisioned with a specific version of the TIA Portal software.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication and download arbitrary programs to the PLC, potentially leading to unauthorized control, disruption of operations, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to have network access to the PLC.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the TIA Portal V13 (or later versions) and network access to the vulnerable PLC. They also need to be in a position to attempt to upload a program to the PLC.
