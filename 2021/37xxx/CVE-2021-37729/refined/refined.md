- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An authenticated path traversal vulnerability exists in the ArubaOS web-based management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal (CWE-22). The vulnerability occurs due to improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to impact the integrity of critical files on the underlying operating system, potentially leading to a denial of service by impacting the availability of the ArubaOS instance and may allow for modification of sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated (have valid credentials). The attack is network based and can be done remotely.
