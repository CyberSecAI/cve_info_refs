[CVE-2021-37333](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-TvkI-3C51w9dab_ftrXVQlo1aIBOJ_/view?usp=sharing)

​

Problem Type: The application is vulnerable to a Session Management Issue.

This vulnerability was found in the Laravel Booking System - Booking Core 2.0.

Description: The Booking Core website was found vulnerable to Session Management Issue.  A password change at [sandbox.bookingcore.org/user/profile/change-password](http://sandbox.bookingcore.org/user/profile/change-password) does not invalidate a session that is opened in a different browser.

## Impact

If an attacker has a user password and is logged into the user's account, as other sessions are not destroyed, the attacker will still be logged in the user's account even after changing password, because his session is still active. A malicious actor has complete access to the user's account till that session expires.
