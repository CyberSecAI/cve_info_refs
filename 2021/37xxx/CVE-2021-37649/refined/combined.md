# Null pointer dereference in `UncompressElement`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-6gv8-p3vj-pxvr
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

The code for `tf.raw_ops.UncompressElement` can be made to trigger a null pointer dereference:

```
import tensorflow as tf

data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensors([0.0])
tf.raw_ops.UncompressElement(
  compressed=tf.data.experimental.to_variant(data),
  output_types=[tf.int64],
  output_shapes=[2])
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/experimental/compression_ops.cc#L50-L53) obtains a pointer to a `CompressedElement` from a `Variant` tensor and then proceeds to dereference it for decompressing. There is no check that the `Variant` tensor contained a `CompressedElement`, so the pointer is actually `nullptr`.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [7bdf50bb4f5c54a4997c379092888546c97c3ebd](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7bdf50bb4f5c54a4997c379092888546c97c3ebd).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
