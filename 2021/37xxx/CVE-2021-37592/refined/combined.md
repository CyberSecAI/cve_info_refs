### tcp: crafted injected packets cause desync after 3whs

Added by [Victor Julien](/users/4) [over 3 years](/projects/suricata/activity?from=2021-07-28 "07/28/2021 12:18 PM") ago.

Affected Versions:[6.0.3](/versions/167 "06/30/2021")Label:Needs backport to 5.0, Needs backport to 6.0CVE:[2021-37592](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37592)Git IDs:

**Description**

Reported by Fratso:

> It is possible to bypass/evade tcp based signature on some Linux servers.
>
> For that, you have to send a FIN-SYN-ACK after a 3WHS and a fake SYN with a bad sequence number after the server's ACK answer which allow the attacker to desynchronize the NIDS and send/receive known signatures without being detected.
>
> For this attack, the attacker must control the TCP/IP stack of a client.
>
> Here's an example:

```

Client === Legit TCP handshake === Server
Client -> [FIN-SYN-ACK] [Seq=1 Ack=2] -> Server # injected (FSA)
Client <- [ACK] [Seq=2 Ack=1] <- Server # legit
Client -> [SYN] [Seq=1234] -> Server # injected (bad seq)
Client -> [PSH-ACK] [Seq=1 Ack=2] SIGNATURE -> Server # undetected
Client <- [ACK] [Seq=x Ack=y] <- Server # legit
Client <- [PSH-ACK] [Seq=x Ack=y] SIGNATURE <- Server # undetected

```
> This evasion has been tested against the following servers on the folowing OS:
>
> | Web server | Tested version | OS | Vulnerable? |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | ------------ | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
> | Nginx | 1.21.1 | Ubuntu 20.04 | Yes |
> | Nginx | 1.21.1 | Windows 10 | No |
> | Apache | 2.4.41 | Ubuntu 20.04 | No |
> | Apache | 2.4.41 | Windows 10 | No |
> | Django | 3.1.5 | Ubuntu 20.04 | Yes |
> | Django | 3.1.5 | Windows 10 | No |
> | Gunicorn | 20.0.4 | Ubuntu 20.04 | Yes |
> | Gunicorn | 20.0.4 | Windows 10 | No |
> | Python3 | 3.8.5 | Ubuntu 20.04 | Yes |
> | Python3 | 3.8.5 | Windows 10 | No |
>
> Apparently, this evasion does not work against Windows 10 and Apache2. However, it does work on some other servers running on Linux only.
