  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Incomplete authorization check in multi-tenant deployments.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-285",
      "CWE-346"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user from any Azure Active Directory tenant could make unauthorized API calls to a vulnerable OneFuzz instance. This could lead to read/write access to private data such as software vulnerability and crash information, security testing tools, and proprietary code/symbols. Additionally, it could enable tampering with existing data and unauthorized code execution on Azure compute resources.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network-based API calls.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An authenticated user from any Azure Active Directory tenant.",
	"details": "The vulnerability existed in OneFuzz versions 2.12.0 and greater, specifically when deployed with the `--multi_tenant_domain` option. The fix involves adding an application-level check of the bearer token's `issuer` against an administrator-configured allowlist."
