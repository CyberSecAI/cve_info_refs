Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input validation in the Quorum software. This allows an authenticated user to inject malicious JavaScript code into various fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user inputs.
- Both stored and reflected XSS conditions are present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Defacing the web application
    - Potentially gaining further access by leveraging the injected script to conduct further attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker can inject malicious scripts into the following fields:
   - User Display Name (Stored XSS)
   - Conference Description (Stored XSS)
   - `/uploaddoc?id=` parameter (Reflected XSS)
   - `/conference?id=` parameter (Reflected XSS)
   - `/conferencebrowseuploadfile?confid=` parameter (Reflected XSS)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Quorum application.
- The attacker can be a remote user, as the vulnerabilities are accessed through the web interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The content provides more specific details than a typical CVE description, including the vulnerable parameters, and that basic script tags are filtered but this is easily bypassed.
- The content states the software is a legacy program and is no longer supported by the vendor, increasing the risk.
