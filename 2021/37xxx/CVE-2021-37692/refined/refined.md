{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the Go code of TensorFlow where string tensors were deallocated during garbage collection using C.TF_TString_Dealloc within a finalizer function. However, the tensor structure wasn't checked for validity until encoding, which occurred before deallocation. If the encoding failed (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions), the deallocation process would still attempt to free the memory using incorrect assumptions, leading to a segfault.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper memory deallocation based on incorrect assumptions about the success of tensor encoding.",
       "Lack of validation of string tensor structure before deallocation."
    ],
    "impact": "A segmentation fault (segfault) could occur, potentially causing the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing string tensors with mismatched dimensions.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create string tensors with mismatched dimensions, which could happen when creating or manipulating tensors within a TensorFlow program."
