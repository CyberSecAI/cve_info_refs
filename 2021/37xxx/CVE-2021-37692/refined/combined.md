# Segfault on strings tensors with mistmatched dimensions, due to Go code

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-cmgw-8vpc-rc59
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0, > 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

Under certain conditions, Go code can trigger a segfault in string deallocation.

For string tensors, `C.TF_TString_Dealloc` is called during garbage collection within a finalizer function. However, tensor structure isn't checked until encoding to avoid a performance penalty. The current method for dealloc assumes that encoding succeeded, but segfaults when a string tensor is garbage collected whose encoding failed (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions).

To fix this, the call to set the finalizer function is deferred until `NewTensor` returns and, if encoding failed for a string tensor, deallocs are determined based on bytes written.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [8721ba96e5760c229217b594f6d2ba332beedf22](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8721ba96e5760c229217b594f6d2ba332beedf22) (merging [#50508](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/50508)).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, which is the other affected version.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-37692

### @wamuir **[wamuir](/wamuir)** commented [Jun 29, 2021](#issue-932233751)

This PR fixes a segmentation violation that may occur during GC on string tensors. The segfault results in a flaky test for `TestNewTensor` at the error test for mismatched dimensions for strings

[tensorflow/tensorflow/go/tensor\_test.go](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c837cf8963d4ef9cb3b3b9e8787cb35f21b68f9d/tensorflow/go/tensor_test.go#L86-L87)

Lines 86 to 87
in
[c837cf8](/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c837cf8963d4ef9cb3b3b9e8787cb35f21b68f9d)

|  | // Mismatched dimensions for strings |
| --- | --- |
|  | [][]string{{"abc"}, {"abcd", "abcd"}}, |

For string tensors, `C.TF_TString_Dealloc` is called during garbage collection within a finalizer function. However, tensor structure isn't checked until encoding to avoid a performance penalty. The current method for dealloc assumes that encoding succeeded, but segfaults when a string tensor is garbage collected whose encoding failed (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions).

To fix this, the call to set the finalizer function is deferred until `NewTensor` returns and, if encoding failed for a string tensor, deallocs are determined based on bytes written.

Sorry, something went wrong.
