Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-37727:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of special elements used in a command within the HPE Aruba Instant (IAP) command line interface. This leads to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection (CWE-77). The CLI does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged user on the underlying operating system of the affected device. This could lead to a full compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote network-based attack.
- The attack vector is through the command-line interface (CLI) of the Aruba Instant Access Point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have high privileges to access the affected CLI interface. The CVSS vector string indicates a 'High' privilege requirement (PR:H).
