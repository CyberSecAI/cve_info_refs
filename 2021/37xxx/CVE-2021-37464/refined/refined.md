Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Lack of proper input validation allows an authenticated user to inject JavaScript code into various fields. Basic script tags are filtered, but this is easily bypassed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Both stored and reflected XSS conditions are possible.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the application user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
  - Stealing session cookies
  - Defacing the website
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user
  - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The following input fields and parameters were identified as vulnerable:
  - User Display Name (stored XSS)
  - Conference Description (stored XSS)
  - `/uploaddoc?id=` (reflected XSS)
  - `/conference?id=` (reflected XSS)
  - `/conferencebrowseuploadfile?confid=` (reflected XSS)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Quorum application.
- The attacker requires network access to the application.
- The attacker crafts malicious JavaScript payloads and inserts them into the vulnerable fields or URL parameters.

**Additional Notes**
- The Github content specifies that the application affected is "Quorum 2.03 and earlier".
- The vendor acknowledges that the admin of this program can access files on the system. While not related to the specific XSS vulnerability, it does highlight potential security concerns.
