- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special characters on the web server configuration page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper input sanitization on the web server configuration page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can retrieve sensitive information, execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser, and potentially gain privileged functions.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious code through special characters on the web server configuration page, the attacker can trigger the XSS vulnerability when a user views the page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a privileged position and needs to induce a user to view a manipulated page on the web server.
