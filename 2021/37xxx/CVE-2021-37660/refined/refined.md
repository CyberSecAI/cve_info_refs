Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-37660

**Root Cause:**
- A logic error in the `InplaceOpBase` class within TensorFlow's `inplace_ops.cc` file. The code used a logical OR (`||`) instead of a logical AND (`&&`) when checking if input tensors `x` and `v` are empty.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Logic:** The use of `||` instead of `&&` in the condition `if (x.NumElements() > 0 || v.NumElements() > 0)` caused the code to proceed with calculations even when both input tensors `x` and `v` were empty.
- **Division by Zero:** When both `x` and `v` are empty, subsequent computations within `DoCompute` could lead to a division by zero, triggering a floating-point exception (FPE).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by triggering a floating point exception. This can be achieved by providing crafted arguments to the `tf.raw_ops.InplaceSub` function (or related inplace operation), where the tensors `x` and `v` are empty.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Input:**  The vulnerability is triggered by providing specific, crafted input tensors to vulnerable TensorFlow operations. Specifically, passing empty tensors for the first two arguments (x and v) in the `tf.raw_ops.InplaceSub` function, along with a non-empty tensor for `i`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to call TensorFlow operations, particularly the `tf.raw_ops.InplaceSub` with crafted input tensors that trigger the flawed logic. This would likely be done via a TensorFlow program that is under the attacker's control (e.g., untrusted input to a model).

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is in the `tensorflow/core/kernels/inplace_ops.cc` file
- The vulnerability is fixed by changing the conditional check to `if (x.NumElements() > 0 && v.NumElements() > 0)`
- The fix was included in commit [e86605c0a336c088b638da02135ea6f9f6753618](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e86605c0a336c088b638da02135ea6f9f6753618).
- Patched versions include 2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1 and 2.6.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
