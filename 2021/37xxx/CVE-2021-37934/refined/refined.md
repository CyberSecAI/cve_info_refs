{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient server-side login-attempt limit enforcement.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application lacks proper rate limiting on login attempts, allowing for an unlimited number of attempts.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform brute-force password attacks, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending multiple login requests to the /account/login endpoint.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be a remote, unauthenticated user and can send HTTP requests to the application's login endpoint."
