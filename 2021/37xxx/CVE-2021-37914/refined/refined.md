The provided content relates to CVE-2021-37914.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Argo Workflows processes expression templates. Specifically, the output of expression templates is evaluated as a literal part of the JSON-stringified template. This allows an attacker to inject malicious values via input parameters, which can then overwrite parts of the workflow definition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **JSON Marshaling with Duplicate Keys:** The Go JSON marshaler allows duplicate keys in a JSON object.
2.  **Alphabetical Ordering of Stringified Template Keys:** When a template is stringified, the keys appear to be ordered alphabetically. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious input parameter that, when processed, overrides existing fields in the workflow template (e.g., `args`).
3. **Expression templates are not properly escaped:** The output of expression templates is not being properly escaped allowing the injection of unescaped `"`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can rewrite parts of a workflow definition using only an input parameter. This can allow them to execute arbitrary commands or otherwise interfere with the workflow's intended behavior.  A motivated attacker could find ways to mutate a workflow in a variety of ways.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the specification of input parameters when running a workflow.  The vulnerability is triggered when a user submits a workflow with a malicious input parameter, and the value is used in an expression template.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to specify input parameters when submitting an Argo Workflow. This means they either need direct access to the system or need to be able to influence the input parameters that are passed to the workflow.
