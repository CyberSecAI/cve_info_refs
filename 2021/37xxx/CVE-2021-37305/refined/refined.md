- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from API endpoints that lack proper authorization checks, leading to information disclosure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unauthorized access to API endpoints: `/sys/user/querySysUser` and `/sys/user/checkOnlyUser`
    - Information leakage: Exposure of sensitive user data (e.g., phone numbers) and user enumeration.
    - Lack of proper access control: The API endpoints can be accessed without authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Sensitive information disclosure: Attackers can retrieve sensitive user information such as phone numbers.
    - User enumeration: Attackers can identify valid usernames present within the system.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Accessing the vulnerable API endpoints `/sys/user/querySysUser?username=admin` and `/sys/user/checkOnlyUser?username=admin` directly via HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable API endpoints. No authentication is required for this exploit.
