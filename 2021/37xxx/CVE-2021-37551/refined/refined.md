The provided content is a security bulletin from JetBrains, which includes information about CVE-2021-37551.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: System user passwords were hashed with SHA-256, which is considered weak for password hashing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of a weak hashing algorithm (SHA-256) for system user passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Potential compromise of system user accounts due to weak password hashing.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could potentially compromise system user accounts if the weak hashing is exploited through methods like dictionary attacks or rainbow tables.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need access to the password hashes, either by direct access or by other means like a database dump.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description by specifying that the affected system user passwords were hashed with SHA-256.
