The provided content is related to CVE-2021-37650.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `tf.raw_ops.ExperimentalDatasetToTFRecord` and `tf.raw_ops.DatasetToTFRecord` operations assuming that all records within a dataset are of string type. There is a missing check for data types. When the dataset contains numeric types instead of strings, the code attempts to interpret these numbers as strings, leading to a heap buffer overflow when calculating the CRC of the record.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap buffer overflow:** Occurs due to incorrect handling of non-string data types, causing a write beyond allocated memory.
- **Segmentation fault:**  A consequence of the heap buffer overflow, leading to a program crash.
- **Type Confusion:** The code interprets numeric data as if it were string data due to missing type checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The heap buffer overflow can lead to a segmentation fault, crashing the application/process.
- **Potential for arbitrary code execution**: While not explicitly mentioned, the heap buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, which can have far more severe impacts.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted Dataset:** An attacker can provide a specially crafted dataset to the vulnerable operations (`tf.raw_ops.ExperimentalDatasetToTFRecord` and `tf.raw_ops.DatasetToTFRecord`) that contains numeric types, triggering the heap buffer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to provide input to the vulnerable operations:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a dataset to the vulnerable TensorFlow operations either directly or indirectly (e.g. through a machine learning model that consumes this type of data as input)

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding a check to ensure the input dataset contains only strings, as seen in the provided commit diff which adds a check to ensure the `dt` is equal to `DT_STRING`.
- The fix was included in TensorFlow versions 2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1, and will be in 2.6.0.
