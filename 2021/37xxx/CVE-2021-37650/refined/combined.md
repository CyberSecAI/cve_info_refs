# Segfault and heap buffer overflow in `{Experimental,}DatasetToTFRecord`

High

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-f8h4-7rgh-q2gm
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

The implementation for `tf.raw_ops.ExperimentalDatasetToTFRecord` and `tf.raw_ops.DatasetToTFRecord` can trigger heap buffer overflow and segmentation fault:

```
import tensorflow as tf

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(3)
dataset = tf.data.experimental.to_variant(dataset)
tf.raw_ops.ExperimentalDatasetToTFRecord(
  input_dataset=dataset,
  filename='/tmp/output',
  compression_type='')
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/experimental/to_tf_record_op.cc#L93-L102) assumes that all records in the dataset are of string type. However, there is no check for that, and the example given above uses numeric types.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [e0b6e58c328059829c3eb968136f17aa72b6c876](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e0b6e58c328059829c3eb968136f17aa72b6c876).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

### CVE ID

…d` where dataset is numeric.

Code assumes only strings inputs and then interprets numbers as valid `tstring`s. Then, when trying to compute the CRC of the record this results in heap buffer overflow.
