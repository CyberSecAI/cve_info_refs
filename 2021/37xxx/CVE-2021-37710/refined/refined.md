The provided content relates to CVE-2021-37710.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper handling of SVG files, leading to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present. The vulnerability is triggered by uploading and rendering SVG files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute within the context of the victim's browser.
- The impact is not specified in detail but could range from session hijacking, redirection, data theft, or defacement of the affected website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is uploading and rendering crafted SVG media files.
- An attacker can upload a malicious SVG file, and when that file is viewed by a user, the embedded JavaScript code will execute in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker must be able to upload files to the platform. This may require an account with sufficient privileges or exploitation of another vulnerability allowing file uploads.
- The attacker does not need to be in a privileged network position to execute the attack.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Shopware versions <= 6.4.3.0
- The fix is included in version 6.4.3.1.
- A patch is available through the auto-updater or a plugin for older versions 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3.
- The commit `abe9f69e1f667800f974acccd3047b4930e4b423` introduces a fix by adding `Header set Content-Security-Policy "script-src 'none'"` for svg files, preventing execution of scripts within them.
