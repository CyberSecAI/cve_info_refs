Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37681:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a null pointer dereference in the TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) implementation of the SVDF (Singular Value Decomposition with Fourier transform) operation. Specifically, the `GetVariableInput` function can return a null pointer, but the code that consumes the output does not check for null before accessing the tensor data. Also, `GetVariableInput` itself could trigger a null pointer exception due to calling `GetMutableInput` which might return null.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is that `GetTensorData` is called on the result of `GetVariableInput` without verifying that the returned pointer is not null. This could cause a null pointer exception (NPE).
- **Potential Null Pointer Exception in `GetVariableInput`:** Because `GetVariableInput` uses `GetMutableInput`, which itself could return a null pointer, accessing `tensor->is_variable` may also cause a null pointer exception.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The immediate impact of this vulnerability is a crash due to the null pointer dereference, which leads to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing specific inputs that result in `GetVariableInput` returning a null pointer in the context of a SVDF operation in TFLite.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to craft an input to a TensorFlow Lite model that uses the SVDF operation in such a way that triggers the null pointer condition. This is a runtime vulnerability, and does not require modifying the model file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow Lite versions prior to 2.6.0.
- Patches have been applied in versions 2.3.4, 2.4.3, and 2.5.1.
- The fix involves adding checks to ensure that the returned pointer is not null before accessing tensor data.
- The vulnerability was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
- There was no CWE associated with this vulnerability.
