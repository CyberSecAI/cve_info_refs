- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged user on the underlying operating system.
- This enables the attacker to fully compromise the underlying operating system on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered through the web-based management user interface of the ArubaOS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid credentials and be authenticated to the web-based management interface.
- Access to the management interface is required (network access).
