Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37179:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of OBJ files within the Siemens Solid Edge Viewer.
- The issue stems from a lack of proper validation of an object's existence before performing operations on it. This can lead to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-After-Free (CWE-416): The application attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to potential corruption and instability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running the Solid Edge Viewer. This could lead to complete system compromise.
- **Application Crash**: Opening a malicious file could lead to an application crash.
- **Data extraction**: An attacker could leverage this vulnerability for data exfiltration.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves user interaction. Specifically, the user must either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious OBJ file.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of a specially crafted OBJ file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or control a malicious OBJ file.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious file with the vulnerable application.
- No specific privileges are needed to execute the attack, user interaction is required.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is located within the PSKERNEL.dll library.
- The vulnerability was reported by xina1i through the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
- Siemens has released an update (SE2021MP7) to address the vulnerability.
