- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Huawei PC product does not properly filter file paths containing special characters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can transport a file to an arbitrary path on the affected system. This could lead to arbitrary file overwrite or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to be on the same network as the targeted system. Then they would be able to exploit this by sending specially crafted paths to the vulnerable product.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim and have the ability to send the file to the vulnerable service. A user interaction is required because the CVSS score has a UI:R value.
