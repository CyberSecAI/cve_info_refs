WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply the principle of least privileges for accounts conﬁgured on the affected devices

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

RUGGEDCOM products provide a level of robustness and reliability that have set the standard for
communications networks deployed in harsh environments. Designed to meet and exceed IEC 61850-3
protocol requirements, the RUGGEDCOM Layer 3 Multi-Service Platform family of switches and routers
offers integrated router, ﬁrewall and VPN functionalities. The RUGGEDCOM RX1400 is a multi-protocol
intelligent node which combines Ethernet switching, routing and application hosting capabilities with
various wide area connectivity options.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37173

The command line interface of affected devices insufﬁciently restrict ﬁle read and write operations for
low privileged users.

This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to escalate privileges and gain root access to the
device.
