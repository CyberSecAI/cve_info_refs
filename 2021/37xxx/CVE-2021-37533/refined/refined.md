Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The FTP client in Apache Commons Net, a Java library, by default trusts the host specified in the PASV response from an FTP server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unvalidated Host in PASV Response:** The FTP client does not validate or sanitize the host provided in the PASV response. This allows a malicious FTP server to redirect the client to connect to an arbitrary host.
*   **Default Trust Behavior:**  The library's default behavior was to trust the host from the PASV response, making it vulnerable without explicit configuration changes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** A malicious FTP server can redirect the client to connect to an internal service on the client's private network. This allows an attacker to probe and potentially gather information about the private network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious FTP Server:** The attacker needs to control or compromise an FTP server that a vulnerable client connects to.
*   **PASV Response Manipulation:** The malicious server manipulates the PASV response to point to a different host, typically within the client's private network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over an FTP server:** The attacker needs to operate an FTP server that the vulnerable client connects to.
*   **Network Accessibility:** The attacker doesn't need to be on the same network, but they must be accessible to the vulnerable client. They could use a compromised server accessible on the internet or within the same local network.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix involves setting the default behavior of the FTP client to ignore the host from the PASV response (similar to cURL).
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Apache Commons Net version 3.9.0.
*   Debian provided security updates for affected packages.
*   The issue is tracked as NET-711 in the Apache JIRA system.
