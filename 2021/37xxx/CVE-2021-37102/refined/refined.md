- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Command injection vulnerability in the CMA service module of Huawei FusionCompute when processing the default certificate file. The software constructs part of a command using external special input from users without sufficient validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient input validation leading to command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands to the system.
- **Attack vectors**:  Attackers need to gain access to the target system and the system needs to be using the default certificate file to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the target system.
