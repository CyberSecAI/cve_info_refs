SUMMARY

The Scalance W1750D device contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to inject
commands or exploit multiple buffer overﬂow vulnerabilities that could lead to denial of service or
unauthenticated remote code execution.

Siemens has released updates for the SCALANCE W1750D and recommends to update to the latest
version. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

recommendations from section

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Block access to the ArubaOS Command Line Interface from all untrusted users
• Block access to the ArubaOS web-based management interface from all untrusted users
• Block access to the Mobility Conductor Command Line Interface from all untrusted users
• Enabling the Enhanced PAPI Security feature where available will prevent exploitation of these

vulnerabilities. Please contact TAC for assistance if needed

• Exploitation requires physical access. Controllers in strictly controlled physical environments are at

low risk

• In order to minimize the likelihood of an attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities, Aruba recommends
that the communication between Controller/Gateways and Access-Points be restricted either by
having a dedicated layer 2 segment/VLAN or, if Controller/Gateways and Access-Points cross layer
3 boundaries, to have ﬁrewall policies restricting the communication of these authorized devices.
Also, enabling the Enhanced PAPI Security feature will prevent the PAPI-speciﬁc vulnerabilities
above from being exploited. Contact Aruba Support for conﬁguration assistance

• The RAPConsole or Local Debug homepage can be reached by users in a split or bridge role. This
can be prevented by conﬁguring an ACL to restrict access to the Local Debug (LD) homepage
which effectively prevents this issue.
Instructions on how to implement this ACL can be found
at https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/ArubaOS_86_Web_Help/Content/arubaos-solutions/

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE W1750D is an Access Point that supports IEEE 802.11ac standards for high-performance
WLAN, and is equipped with two dual-band radios, which can provide access and monitor the network
simultaneously.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-5318

The web interface for RAPConsole lacks Anti-CSRF protections in place for state-changing operations.
This can potentially be exploited by an attacker to reboot the affected device if the attacker can
convince a user to visit a specially-crafted web page.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37716

There are multiple buffer overﬂow vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthenticated remote code
execution by sending especially crafted packets destined to the PAPI (Aruba Networks AP management
protocol) UDP port (8211) of devices running ArubaOS. This may potentially allow for denial-of-service
attacks and/or remote code execution in the underlying operating system.
