- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Authenticated command injection vulnerabilities exist in the ArubaOS command line interface, specifically in instances of the Mobility Conductor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command ('Command Injection').
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged user on the underlying operating system, leading to full compromise of the Mobility Conductor.
- **Attack vectors**: Command injection via the ArubaOS command line interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with high privileges to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability is specific to Mobility Conductor instances.
