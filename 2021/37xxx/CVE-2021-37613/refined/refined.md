Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from how the ASQ (Application Security Quality) engine within Stormshield Network Security (SNS) devices interprets certain network transactions when the SSL proxy is enabled and decrypting traffic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of specific network transactions by the ASQ engine when SSL proxy is enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, leading to a reboot of the SNS device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending specific malicious network traffic to the SNS device.
- The attacker needs to be on an adjacent network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network segment or an adjacent network.
- No specific privileges are required.
- No user interaction is needed.
- The attack has high complexity.
- The adjacent network attack vector indicates that an attacker within the local network of the targeted appliance can conduct the attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue is present in a wide range of SNS versions.
- A functional exploit is known to exist, and the vendor has released official fixes.
- There is no workaround for the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is related to the improper interpretation of network transactions by the ASQ engine when SSL proxy is enabled, leading to a reboot of the device.
