since this release

[v11.1.0](/vercel/next.js/tree/v11.1.0)

[`ce4adfc`](/vercel/next.js/commit/ce4adfc02d3532e2c62ed8088660df1655e66278)

A security team from one of our partners noticed an issue in Next.js that allowed for an open redirect to occur.

Specially encoded paths could be used when `pages/_error.js` was statically generated allowing an open redirect to occur to an external site.

In general, this redirect does not directly harm users although can allow for phishing attacks by redirecting to an attacker's domain from a trusted domain.

We recommend upgrading to the latest version of Next.js to improve the overall security of your application.

## How to Upgrade

* We have released patch versions for both the stable and canary channels of Next.js.
* To upgrade run `npm install next@latest --save`

## Impact

* **Affected:** Users of Next.js between 10.0.5 and 10.2.0
* **Affected:** Users of Next.js between 11.0.0 and 11.0.1 using `pages/_error.js` without `getInitialProps`
* **Affected:** Users of Next.js between 11.0.0 and 11.0.1 using `pages/_error.js` and `next export`
* **Not affected**: Deployments on Vercel ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com)) are not affected
* **Not affected:** Deployments **with** `pages/404.js`

We recommend everyone to upgrade regardless of whether you can reproduce the issue or not.

### How to Assess Impact

If you think sensitive code or data could have been exposed, you can filter logs of affected sites by `//` (double slash at the start of the url) followed by a domain.

## What is Being Done

As Next.js has grown in popularity and usage by enterprises, it has received the attention of security researchers and auditors. We are thankful to Gabriel Benmergui from Robinhood for their investigation and discovery of the original bug and subsequent responsible disclosure.

We've landed a patch that ensures path parsing is handled properly for these paths so that the open redirect can no longer occur.

Regression tests for this attack were added to the [security](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/canary/test/integration/production/test/security.js) integration test suite

* We have notified known Next.js users in advance of this publication.
* A public CVE was released.
* We encourage responsible disclosure of future reports. Please email us at `security@vercel.com`. We are actively monitoring this mailbox.
