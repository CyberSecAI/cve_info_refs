Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from improper path parsing in Next.js when the `pages/_error.js` file is statically generated. Specially crafted, encoded paths could bypass intended logic, leading to an open redirect.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Open Redirect:** The primary weakness is the ability to redirect users to an arbitrary external site. This occurs due to insufficient validation of URL paths, particularly when `pages/_error.js` is statically generated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Phishing Attacks:** While the redirect itself does not directly harm users, it can be used to facilitate phishing attacks. By redirecting from a trusted domain to an attacker's domain, users may be tricked into providing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially Encoded Paths:** The attack vector involves crafting specially encoded URL paths that trigger the open redirect vulnerability. This is done by exploiting the way Next.js parses paths when `pages/_error.js` is statically generated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious URLs and induce users to click on links with those crafted paths. There is no requirement for an attacker to be within a certain network or to have access to specific infrastructure.
- The target application must be running a vulnerable version of Next.js.
- The vulnerability is triggered when `pages/_error.js` is statically generated, which implies the site is being served statically and not using server-side rendering.
- The vulnerability is specific to the error page (`_error.js`) so the targeted path needs to be one which will trigger the error page.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability was discovered by a security team from one of Next.js's partners, Gabriel Benmergui from Robinhood.
- Deployments on Vercel are not affected because they do not use static error page generation.
- Applications that have a custom `pages/404.js` are not affected by this issue either.
- The fix ensures that path parsing is correctly handled to prevent the open redirect.
- The identified affected versions are between 10.0.5 and 10.2.0, also 11.0.0 and 11.0.1 using `pages/_error.js` without `getInitialProps`, and 11.0.0 to 11.0.1 using `pages/_error.js` and `next export`
