Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37561:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is caused by a missing bounds check within the Wi-Fi driver. This allows for an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, which occurs when a program writes data beyond the allocated memory buffer. This can lead to memory corruption and other issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Escalation of Privilege (EoP):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a remote attacker gaining elevated privileges on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, Proximal Attack:** The attack can be launched remotely by an attacker who is in close proximity to the vulnerable device (e.g., within Wi-Fi range).
*   **Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS):** The exploitation is triggered if WPS is used on the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Proximity:** An attacker needs to be within the range of the device's Wi-Fi signal.
*   **WPS Usage:** The target device must have WPS enabled and in use.
*   **No Additional Execution Privileges:** The attacker does not require any pre-existing execution privileges on the target system.
*   **User Interaction Required:** User interaction is needed for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects several MediaTek chipsets and Wi-Fi drivers.
*   The issue is addressed by MediaTek in a security bulletin and by NETGEAR through firmware updates.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 8.2, classified as "High".
*   The CVSS vector is CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L.
*   The provided advisory states that no workarounds are available for the vulnerability
*   The vulnerability is part of a larger group of vulnerabilities affecting WPS and IEEE-1905 related functions on MediaTek chipsets.

**Summary of extracted information:**
*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2021-37561
*   **Root cause:** Missing bounds check in Wi-Fi driver leading to out-of-bounds write.
*   **Vulnerability:** CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write
*   **Impact:** Remote escalation of privilege (EoP)
*   **Attack vector:** Remote, proximal via Wi-Fi using WPS.
*   **Attacker requirements:** Proximity, WPS usage, no pre-existing privileges.
*   **User interaction:** Required for exploitation.
