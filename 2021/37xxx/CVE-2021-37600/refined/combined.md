| Hi,  It seems that there exists a potential integer overflow that can lead buffer overflows. Please find the following description:   1. `sems_nsems` can be an arbitrary large number    <https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/blob/8344a81f7a726cef4640f9368bd6728eff6987bc/sys-utils/ipcutils.c#L272> 2. Call to `get_sem_elements` with the structure    <https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/blob/8344a81f7a726cef4640f9368bd6728eff6987bc/sys-utils/ipcutils.c#L217> 3. Call to `calloc` with the large integer can cause a memory allocation with an overflowed size    <https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/blob/8344a81f7a726cef4640f9368bd6728eff6987bc/sys-utils/ipcutils.c#L224> |

| Good point.  I have added a check against SIZE\_MAX (as calloc() is based on size\_t), it's probably still too optimistic, but I don't think we have to be smarter than libc :-) |

The function is used by tools like lsipc, there is nothing with privileges to attract system resources, etc. |

| xcalloc just calls calloc and ends the program if calloc fails.  According the the glibc documentation, calling calloc with parameters that would overflow will cause it to return an error.  I think this is a non-issue, and the SIZE\_MAX check is pointless. |

| Hmm, if sizeof(size\_t) < sizeof(uint64\_t), that could cause p->sem\_nsems to be truncated (not overflow) when passed to xcalloc. So the SIZE\_MAX check does make sense. |

| The maximum output of %10u is 4294967295, that is, 32-bit SIZE\_MAX. Therefore, sem\_nsems < SIZE\_MAX is always true. In addition, sem\_nsems < SIZE\_MAX does not resolve the overflow. For example, when sem\_nsems is less than SIZE\_MAX but greater than SIZE\_MAX / sizeof (struct sem\_elem), multiplication overflow occurs in xcalloc. |

| For example, when sem\_nsems is less than SIZE\_MAX but greater than SIZE\_MAX / sizeof (struct sem\_elem), multiplication overflow occurs in xcalloc.  xcalloc() just calls calloc(). The calloc() implementation in glibc guards against multiplication overflows. If other C libraries do not guard against it, please report bugs against them. |

| I do not understand the status here:   * The issue is closed * There is a commit * Comments said that the commit is useless * Comments said is a false positive   Meanwhile, the CVE is still present <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37600> but "under discussion" waiting for an update . Is it really a False-Positive ?? |

| OK, but what is your assessment?   * Is it closed because your commit fix the issue and we should all patch or upgrade? * Is it closed because this is a false-positive? (and the CVE should be rejected) |

| It's a mistake when any code mixes size\_t and uint64\_t without care about limits, this is a bug and it's fixed now. But I don't think it's a security issue, because call calloc/malloc() with any nonsense (huge size) argument is a legal operation without any side effect on Linux. If you will try to fill this memory then it's again operation with standard scenario (swap, oom, ...). I do not see anything really dangerous with it.  From my point of view, it's a bug like many others. |

Package        : util-linux
Version        : 2.33.1-0.1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-37600 CVE-2024-28085
Debian Bug     : 826596 991619 1067849

CVE-2024-28085

    Skyler Ferrante discovered that the wall(1) utility found in
    util-linux, a collection of system utilities for Linux, does not
    filter escape sequences from command line arguments.  This allows
    unprivileged local users to put arbitrary text on other users
    terminals if mesg is set to ‘y’ and the wall executable is setgid,
    which could lead to information disclosure.

    With this update the wall executable is no longer installed setgid
    tty.

CVE-2021-37600

    Kihong Heo found an integer overflow which can potentially lead to
    buffer overflow if an attacker were able to use system resources in
    a way that leads to a large number in the /proc/sysvipc/sem file.
    NOTE: this is issue is unexploitable in GNU C Library environments,
    and possibly in all realistic environments.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.33.1-0.1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your util-linux packages.

For the detailed security status of util-linux please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/util-linux>
