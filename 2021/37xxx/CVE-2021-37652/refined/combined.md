# Use after free in boosted trees creation

High

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-m7fm-4jfh-jrg6
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

The implementation for `tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCreateEnsemble` can result in a use after free error if an attacker supplies specially crafted arguments:

```
import tensorflow as tf

v= tf.Variable([0.0])
tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCreateEnsemble(
  tree_ensemble_handle=v.handle,
  stamp_token=[0],
  tree_ensemble_serialized=['0'])
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/resource_ops.cc#L55) uses a reference counted resource and decrements the refcount if the initialization fails, as it should. However, when the code was written, the resource was represented as a naked pointer but later refactoring has changed it to be a smart pointer. Thus, when the pointer leaves the scope, a subsequent `free`-ing of the resource occurs, but this fails to take into account that the refcount has already reached 0, thus the resource has been already freed. During this double-free process, members of the resource object are accessed for cleanup but they are invalid as the entire resource has been freed.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [5ecec9c6fbdbc6be03295685190a45e7eee726ab](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5ecec9c6fbdbc6be03295685190a45e7eee726ab).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

A very old version of the code used `result` as a simple pointer to a resource. Two years later, the pointer got changed to a `unique_ptr` but author forgot to remove the call to `Unref`. Three years after that, we finally uncover the UAF.
