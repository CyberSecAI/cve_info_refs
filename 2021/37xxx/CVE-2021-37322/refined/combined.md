Why does the program crash?  It likely makes cxxfilt crashing. I'm just saying it's likely a product of a fuzzer and it's very unlikely to be fixed. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=99188#c7)  Michael Matz    2021-12-06 15:59:43 UTC  ``` Actually, it _is_ fixed.  This problem report is about version 2.26, which is many years old.  Current versions don't have this problem, at the very least when the problematic code was removed whole-sale in late 2018/early 2019. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=99188#c8)  Nick Clifton    2021-12-14 14:47:58 UTC  ``` (In reply to Michael Matz from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=99188#c7)) > Actually, it _is_ fixed.

Current versions don't have this problem, at the very least when > the problematic code was removed whole-sale in late 2018/early 2019.  Just checked - the problem is fixed in 2.27 and all later versions.... ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=99188#c9)  Pavel Mayorov    2021-12-19 21:11:52 UTC  ``` If it's still important for someone, then this is a duplicate of [bug 67394](show_bug.cgi?id=67394 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - crash due to null pointer deref in demangle_signature()") (CVE-2016-4487), which was solved by [bug 70481](show_bug.cgi?id=70481 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Regression] Libiberty Demangler segfaults") (CVE-2016-4488). So for version 2.26 use the patch <https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=patch;h=9e6edb946c0e9a2c530fbae3eeace148eca0de33>. ``` |  |
