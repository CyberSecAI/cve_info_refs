Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37666:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incomplete validation of the `rt_nested_splits` argument in the `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToVariant` operation within TensorFlow. Specifically, the implementation failed to check for the case where `rt_nested_splits` is an empty list.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation: The code did not properly validate if the `rt_nested_splits` input was empty before processing it.
- Null pointer dereference: When `rt_nested_splits` is empty, the code attempts to bind a reference to a null pointer, leading to undefined behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Undefined behavior: Exploiting this vulnerability leads to undefined behavior due to the null pointer reference, which could include a crash, denial of service, or other unexpected results depending on the execution environment.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious input to the `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToVariant` function, setting `rt_nested_splits` as an empty list, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to call the `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToVariant` operation with arbitrary inputs. This could be through a crafted model, a data input pipeline, or any code execution path that involves TensorFlow operations.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_variant_op.cc` file.
- The fix was implemented in commit `be7a4de6adfbd303ce08be4332554dff70362612`.
- The fix adds a check to ensure `ragged_nested_splits_len > 0` and throws an error if `rt_nested_splits` is an empty list.
- Affected versions are TensorFlow versions less than 2.6.0. Patched versions are 2.3.4, 2.4.3, and 2.5.1.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity.
- The vulnerability was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
