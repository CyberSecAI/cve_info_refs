Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-37749

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection present in the "Id" parameter within the "sourceItems" array of dictionaries within the Hexagon GeoMedia WebMap 2020 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the "Id" parameter.
- **Stacked Queries:** The application allows the execution of multiple SQL statements in a single request.
- **Time-Based Injection:** The attacker can use time delays within the SQL queries to infer the presence and success of the injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Extraction/Manipulation:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database or manipulate it.
- **System Compromise:** In a worst-case scenario, a full compromise of the backend system is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/WMPS/MapService.svc/v1.0/Stateless/GetMap` endpoint.
- **Malicious "Id" Parameter:** The "Id" parameter within the "sourceItems" array is the entry point for the SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter**: The attacker must know the specific endpoint to send the request to and the vulnerable parameter name.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by SilentGrid.
- A hotfix was released by Hexagon, but it is unclear if it was included in the GeoMedia WebMap 2020 Update 2.
- SilentGrid reported the vulnerability to Hexagon in June 2020. After some initial response, Hexagon became unresponsive, which led to public disclosure of the vulnerability in August 2021.
